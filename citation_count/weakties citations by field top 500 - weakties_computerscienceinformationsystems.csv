This paper integrates the Social Cognitive Theory and the Social Capital Theory to construct a model for investigating the motivations behind people's knowledge sharing in virtual communities. The study holds that the facets of social capital - social interaction ties, trust, norm of reciprocity, identification, shared vision and shared language - will influence individuals' knowledge sharing in virtual communities. We also argue that outcome expectations - community-related outcome expectations and personal outcome expectations - can engender knowledge sharing in virtual communities. Data collected from 310 members of one professional virtual community provide support for the proposed model. The results help in identifying the motivation underlying individuals' knowledge sharing behavior in professional virtual communities.

The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in CiteSpace II, a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981-2004) and terrorism (1990-2003). Prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks were verified in collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work are discussed.

The consideration of the endogenous nature of online user reviews significantly changes the analysis. Our result shows that the rating of online user reviews has no significant impact on movies' box office revenues after accounting for the endogeneity, indicating that online user reviews have little persuasive effect on consumer purchase decisions. Nevertheless, we find that box office sales are significantly influenced by the volume of online posting, suggesting the importance of awareness effect. The finding of awareness effect for online user reviews is Surprising as online reviews under the analysis are posted to the same website and are not expected to increase product awareness. We attribute the effect to online user reviews as an indicator of the intensity of underlying word-of-mouth that plays a dominant role in driving box office revenues. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world information networks, including language networks, social networks, and citation networks.

J,"Yang, J; Leskovec, J",,,,"Yang, Jaewon; Leskovec, Jure",,,Defining and evaluating network communities based on ground-truth,KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nodes in real-world networks organize into densely linked communities where edges appear with high concentration among the members of the community. Identifying such communities of nodes has proven to be a challenging task due to a plethora of definitions of network communities, intractability of methods for detecting them, and the issues with evaluation which stem from the lack of a reliable gold-standard ground-truth. In this paper, we distinguish between structural and functional definitions of network communities. Structural definitions of communities are based on connectivity patterns, like the density of connections between the community members, while functional definitions are based on (often unobserved) common function or role of the community members in the network. We argue that the goal of network community detection is to extract functional communities based on the connectivity structure of the nodes in the network. We then identify networks with explicitly labeled functional communities to which we refer as ground-truth communities. In particular, we study a set of 230 large real-world social, collaboration, and information networks where nodes explicitly state their community memberships. For example, in social networks, nodes explicitly join various interest-based social groups. We use such social groups to define a reliable and robust notion of ground-truth communities. We then propose a methodology, which allows us to compare and quantitatively evaluate how different structural definitions of communities correspond to ground-truth functional communities. We study 13 commonly used structural definitions of communities and examine their sensitivity, robustness and performance in identifying the ground-truth. We show that the 13 structural definitions are heavily correlated and naturally group into four classes. We find that two of these definitions, Conductance and Triad participation ratio, consistently give the best performance in identifying ground-truth communities. We also investigate a task of detecting communities given a single seed node. We extend the local spectral clustering algorithm into a heuristic parameter-free community detection method that easily scales to networks with more than 100 million nodes. The proposed method achieves 30 % relative improvement over current local clustering methods.",,,,,"Leskovec, Jure/0000-0002-5411-923X",,,,,,,,,,,,0219-1377,0219-3116,,,,JAN,2015,42,1,,,,,181,213,,10.1007/s10115-013-0693-z,,,,,,,WOS:000347286900008,,,,,

We cast this challenge as an information flow problem in a social network. This paper presents social network analysis metrics that may be used to support a novel and practical forwarding solution to provide efficient message delivery in disconnected delay-tolerant MANETs. These metrics are based on social analysis of a node's past interactions and consists of three locally evaluated components: a node's ""betweenness"" centrality ( calculated using ego networks), a node's social ""similarity"" to the destination node, and a node's tie strength relationship with the destination node.

A qualitative analysis of interviews conducted with 23 IT professionals and business users in a large manufacturing and distribution company is summarized in a conceptual framework showing the conditions, practices, and consequences of knowledge brokering by IT professionals. The framework suggests that brokering practices are conditioned by structural conditions, including decentralization and a federated IT management organization, and by technical conditions, specifically shared IT systems that serve as boundary objects. Brokering practices include gaining permission to cross organizational boundaries, surfacing and challenging assumptions made by IT users, translation and interpretation, and relinquishing ownership of knowledge.

The results show that at four major points of intersection, social media has considerable theoretical implications for SNA.

Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods study with surveys (n = 193) and interviews (n = 13) of community members along with a content analysis of discussion forum messages (n = 1924 messages). Qualitative data were analyzed for social support themes. Results: Survey respondents were primarily white (91.4%) and female (93.8%) with mean age 37.3 years and mean body mass index 30.9. They used forums frequently, with 56.8% reading messages, 36.1% replying to messages, and 18.5% posting messages to start a discussion related to weight loss on a daily or more frequent basis. Major social support themes were encouragement and motivation, mentioned at least once by 87.6% of survey respondents, followed by information (58.5%) and shared experiences (42.5%). Subthemes included testimonies, recognition for success, accountability, friendly competition, and humor. Members valued convenience, anonymity, and the non-judgmental interactions as unique characteristics of Internet-mediated support. Conclusion: This Internet weight loss community plays a prominent role in participants' weight loss efforts. Social support within Internet weight loss communities merits further evaluation as a weight loss resource for clinicians to recommend to patients. Understanding these communities could improve how health professionals evaluate, build, harness, and manipulate social support for weight loss. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

With the convergence of enabling technologies, the complexity of the mobile ecosystem is increasing multifold as new actors are emerging, new relations are formed, and the traditional distribution of power is shifted. Drawing on theories of network science, complex systems, interfirm relationships, and the creative art and science of visualization, this paper identifies key players and maps the complex structure and dynamics of nearly 7000 global companies and over 18,000 relationships in the converging mobile ecosystem. Our approach enables decision makers to (i) visually explore the complexity of interfirm relations in the mobile ecosystem, (ii) discover the relation between current and emerging segments, (iii) determine the impact of convergence on ecosystem structure, (iv) understand a firm's competitive position, and (v) identify interfirm relation patterns that may influence their choice of innovation strategy or business models.

In this paper we study a set of 230 large real-world social, collaboration and information networks where nodes explicitly state their group memberships. For example, in social networks nodes explicitly join various interest based social groups. We use such groups to define a reliable and robust notion of ground-truth communities. We then propose a methodology which allows us to compare and quantitatively evaluate how different structural definitions of network communities correspond to ground-truth communities. We choose 13 commonly used structural definitions of network communities and examine their sensitivity, robustness and performance in identifying the ground-truth. We show that the 13 structural definitions are heavily correlated and naturally group into four classes. We find that two of these definitions, Conductance and Triad-participation-ratio, consistently give the best performance in identifying ground-truth communities. We also investigate a task of detecting communities given a single seed node. We extend the local spectral clustering algorithm into a heuristic parameter-free community detection method that easily scales to networks with more than hundred million nodes.

Findings - The constructed set of metrics was found to be valid and efficiently usable according to the principles of the applied theories. Moreover all the proposed metrics could be adapted for such sites as Google +. Research limitations/implications - Limitations can only be identified within the validation process as the metrics were only applied to ten representative companies from the Eurozone. Practical implications - The proposed metrics will help users, marketing/PR/communication professionals and company managers to measure their and their competitors' popularity, commitment, virality (metrics which reflect stakeholder engagement), and the mood of stakeholders, and use content analysis in order to measure social legitimacy via CSR information disclosure on Facebook.

A detailed data set about the official content-sharing function on Twitter, called retweet, is collected and the statistical relationships between users' social network characteristics and their retweeting acts are documented. A two-stage consumption-sharing model is then estimated using the conditional maximum likelihood estimatio (MLE) method. The empirical results convincingly support our hypothesis that weak ties (in the form of unidirectional links) are more likely to engage in the social exchange process of content sharing.

Social network analysis methodology was used to develop sociograms of the emergent communication patterns and identify the role of individual providers in the handoff process based on the number of contacts with other providers and incoming and outgoing communication activity. Individual handoff network size ranged from 11 to 20 providers. Participants were asked to describe the method of communication they used to access or share clinical information with other providers, their preferred method of communication; their satisfaction with the available options; and their suggestions for how the process could be improved. Results: The network patterns that emerged uncovered the overlapping use of synchronous and asynchronous communication methods (verbally via phone or in person; or written via paper charts and/or an electronic records). No particular professional group dominated or coordinated information flow; instead each handoff network exhibited unique communication patterns and information coordination by two or more influential providers from nursing, medicine, or pharmacy. Most (84%) participants preferred verbal communication. Overall satisfaction with the current communication process varied by unit: 82% of emergency department providers and 54% of the providers working in the admitting units stated they were satisfied or very satisfied. Recommendations for improvement included converting all units to the electronic health record, electronic handoff communication modules and asynchronous multi-professional communication logs. Conclusions: The results of this exploratory study provide a foundation for future research examining how network structure and communication principles can be used to design health information technology that compliments the non-linear information gathering and dissemination behaviors of providers from multiple professions.

However, instituting clan control in such conditions is challenging as people come to a project with diverse skills and backgrounds. There is often insufficient time for clan control to develop naturally This paper investigates the question, ""How can clan control be enacted in complex IT projects?"" Recognizing social capital as a resource, we conceptualize a clan as a group with strong social capital (i.e., where its members have developed their structural, cognitive, and relational ties to the point that they share common values and beliefs and are committed to a set of peer norms). We theorize that the enactment of clan control is a dual process of (1) building the clan by developing its social capital dimensions (structural, cognitive, and relational ties) or reappropriating social capital from elsewhere and (2) leveraging the clan by reinforcing project-facilitating shared values, beliefs, and norms, and inhibiting those that impede the achievement of project goals. We explore how clan control was enacted in a large IT project at a major logistics organization in which clan control was quickly instituted to avoid an impending project failure. Our research contributes to theory in three ways: (1) we reconcile the two differing views of clan control into a single framework, (2) we explain the role of controllers in enacting clan control, and (3) we clarify, how formal control can be employed to develop clan control.",,,,"Chua, Cecil/F-3332-2012","Chua, Cecil/0000-0001-9384-1535",,,,,,,,,,,,0276-7783,,,,,JUN,2012,36,2,,,,,577,600,,,,,,,,,WOS:000304296400012,,,,,

Specifically, we examined the effects of online tie strength, perceived diagnosticity, and product-related risks on consumers' purchase intentions. We conducted a field experiment on Facebook to test these hypotheses. We found that the product information and recommendations provided by friends with whom consumers have strong ties are perceived as having a high level of diagnosticity. The latter increases the probability that the consumers will purchase the product in question. Product-related risks moderate the effect of tie strength on perceived diagnosticity. For high-risk products, the information and recommendations provided by strong-tie contacts have a greater effect on purchase intentions than the information and recommendations provided by weak-tie contacts.

The goal here is to conceptualize the IS success antecedents (ISSA) area of research through surveying, synthesizing, and explicating the work in the domain. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, a taxonomy of 12 general categories is created, and existing research within each category is examined. Important lacunae in the direction of work have been determined. It is found that little work has been conducted on the macro-level independent variables, the most difficult variables to assess, although these variables may be the most important to understanding the ultimate value of IS to organizations. Similarly, ISSA research on success variables of consequence to organizations was found severely lacking. Variable analysis research on organizational-level success variables was found to be literally nonexistent in the IS field, whereas research in the organizational studies field was found to provide useful directions for IS researchers. The specifics of the 12 taxonomy areas are analyzed and directions for research in each of them provided.

It is a place where teenage patients stay up-to-date about their social life-it is not seen as a place to discuss their diagnosis and treatment. The majority of teenage patients don't use social media to come into contact with others with similar conditions and they don't use the internet to find health information about their diagnosis.

Moreover, the number of kin in a Facebook network was a crucial component because it predicted online tension whereas number of work and social contacts did not.

Meanwhile, the mobility patterns of mobile devices strongly depend on the users' movements, which are closely related to their social relationships and behaviors. Consequently, today's mobile networks are becoming increasingly human centric. This leads to the emergence of a new field which we call socially aware networking (SAN). One of the major features of SAN is that social awareness becomes indispensable information for the design of networking solutions. This emerging paradigm is applicable to various types of networks (e.g., opportunistic networks, mobile social networks, delay-tolerant networks, ad hoc networks, etc.) where the users have social relationships and interactions. By exploiting social properties of nodes, SAN can provide better networking support to innovative applications and services. In addition, it facilitates the convergence of human society and cyber-physical systems. In this paper, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we present a survey of this emerging field. Basic concepts of SAN are introduced. We intend to generalize the widely used social properties in this regard.

To investigate how PHAs and their friends/family members acquire and share network-mediated HIV/AIDS information, semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted in three rural regions of Canada. Interviews were carried outwith 114 PHAs, their friends/family members, and health care and service providers.

Interview data were analyzed qualitatively and compared to Haythornthwaite's (1996) concepts of network-mediated information processes and Talja and Hansen's (2006) collaborative information behavior framework. Findings revealed that participants obtained HIV/AIDS information from their networks through five interactive processes: joint seeking, tag-team seeking, exposure, opportunity, and legitimation. The results of this study advance information behavior theory by pointing to the interactive character of information behavior and introducing new concepts to describe everyday life collaborative information behavior. This research also demonstrates the extensive interplay between health information exchange and the sharing of emotional support.

While this research has been prescriptive of contract terms that lead to successful outsourcing, there is need for clarity on what specific governance options are available at each moment of governance and how governance choices at one moment affect those at another, and consequently affect outsourcing outcomes. This paper draws on theoretical and empirical work in the areas of governance and contracts to develop a model of IS outsourcing governance, delineating specific moments of governance (MoG). It describes how the IS outsourcing context circumscribes market, hierarchy, and network governance options that are available at the promissory contract and psychological contract moments.

The aim of this work is twofold. First, we present a detailed analysis of a real Facebook data set aimed at characterising the properties of human social relationships in online environments. We find that certain properties of online social networks appear to be similar to those found ""offline"" (i.e., on human social networks maintained without the use of social networking sites). Our experimental results indicate that on Facebook there is a limited number of social relationships an individual can actively maintain and this number is close to the well-known Dunbar's number (150) found in offline social networks. Second, we also present a number of linear models that predict tie strength (the key figure to quantitatively represent the importance of social relationships) from a reduced set of observable Facebook variables. Specifically, we are able to predict with good accuracy (i.e., higher than 80%) the strength of social ties by exploiting only four variables describing different aspects of users interaction on Facebook. We find that the recency of contact between individuals - used in other studies as the unique estimator of tie strength - has the highest relevance in the prediction of tie strength. Nevertheless, using it in combination with other observable quantities, such as indices about the social similarity between people, can lead to more accurate predictions (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigate the impact of network social capital on open source project success. We define network social capital as the benefits open source developers secure from their membership in developer collaboration networks. We focus on one specific type of success as measured by the rate of knowledge creation in an open source project. Specific hypotheses are developed and tested using a longitudinal panel of 2,378 projects hosted at Source Forge. We find that network social capital is not equally accessible to or appropriated by all projects. Our main results are as follows. First, projects with greater internal cohesion (that is, cohesion among the project members) are more successful. Second, external cohesion (that is, cohesion among the external contacts of a project) has an inverse U-shaped relationship with the project's success; moderate levels of external cohesion are best for a project's success rather than very low or very high levels. Third, the technological diversity of the external network of a project also has the greatest benefit when it is neither too low nor too high. Fourth, the number of direct and indirect external contacts positively affects a project's success such that the effect of the number of direct contacts is moderated by the number of indirect contacts.

Recent surveys indicate that while many organizations severely restrict or ban SNSs (i.e., Facebook and Twitter) at work, a large majority are actively using, or evaluating the use of SNSs. The purpose of this study is to investigate the implementation of an internal SNS designed to help a large financial institution's IT new hire program. On the basis of a case study informed by boundary theory and the theory of positive emotions, the research describes the SNS, its uses and how it impacted both the employees and the organization. We found that SNSs blur the boundary between work life and social life and that this boundary blurring creates positive emotions for the employees that use the system. These emotions create personal resources, which then have organizational impacts. While some of the non-users of the system, the IT middle managers, experienced isolation, frustration and resentment, the executives overseeing this SNS attribute improved morale, better employee engagement and even reduced employee turnover to the internal SNS.

In the real world, however, most people are socially selfish; i.e., they are willing to forward packets for nodes with whom they have social ties but not others, and such willingness varies with the strength of the social tie. Following the philosophy of design for user, we propose a Social Selfishness Aware Routing (SSAR) algorithm to cope with user selfishness and provide good routing performance in an efficient way. To select an effective forwarding node, SSAR considers both users' willingness to forward and their contact opportunity, and derives a metric with mathematical modeling and machine learning techniques to measure the forwarding capability of the mobile nodes. Moreover, SSAR formulates the data forwarding process as a Multiple Knapsack Problem with Assignment Restrictions (MKPAR) to satisfy user demands for selfishness and performance. Trace-driven simulations show that SSAR allows users to maintain selfishness and achieves good routing performance with low transmission cost. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A relatively new technology, social bookmarking, is increasingly being used in many organizations (McAfee 2006), and may enhance employee innovativeness by providing a new, socially mediated channel for discovering information. Users of such systems create publicly viewable lists of bookmarks (each being a hyperlink to an information resource) and often assign searchable keywords (""tags"") to these bookmarks. We explore two different perspectives on how accessing others' bookmarks could enhance how innovative an individual is at work. First, we develop two hypotheses around the idea that quantity may be a proxy for diversity, following a well established literature that holds that the more information obtained and the larger the number of sources consulted, the higher the likelihood an individual will come across novel ideas. Next, we offer two hypotheses adapted from social network research that argue that the shape of the network of connections that is created when individuals access each others' bookmarks can reflect information novelty, and that individuals whose networks bridge more structural holes and have greater effective reach are likely to be more innovative. An analysis of bookmarking system use in a global professional services firm provides strong support for the social diversity of information sources as a predictor of employee innovativeness, but no support that the number of bookmarks accessed matters. By extending the social networks literature to theorize the functionalities offered by social bookmarking systems, this research establishes structural holes theory as a valuable lens through which social technologies may be understood.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0276-7783,,,,,SEP,2011,35,3,,,,,629,643,,,,,,,,,WOS:000294088300007,,,,,

Therefore, many organizations invest in enterprise social media (ESM) to establish electronic networks of practice and to foster knowledge exchange among employees. ESM improves interaction transparency and can be regarded as a sociotechnical system that provides a language for communication and symbolic action as well as a better sense of others' social identity. Accordingly, the individual characteristics of knowledge seekers and contributors determine why and how interactions occur. However, existing studies tend to focus only on knowledge contributors' characteristics and to treat knowledge as an object that needs to be transferred. To address this gap, this study conceptualizes and empirically tests a multilevel model of knowledge exchange in electronic networks of practice (ENoP) that includes the characteristics of knowledge seekers and knowledge contributors as well as their dyadic relationship from an activity-centered language/action point of view. A dataset of 15,505 enterprise microblogging messages reveals that knowledge seekers' characteristics and relational factors drive knowledge exchanges in social media-enabled ENoP.

Even though detection of such communities is of great interest, understanding the structure communities in large networks remains relatively limited. In particular, due to the unavailability of labeled ground-truth data, it was traditionally very hard to develop accurate models of network community structure. Here we use six large social, collaboration, and information networks where nodes explicitly state their ground-truth community memberships. For example, nodes in social networks join into explicitly defined interest based groups, and we use such groups as explicitly labeled ground-truth communities. We use such ground-truth communities to study their structural signatures by analyzing how ground-truth communities emerge in networks and how they overlap. We observe some surprising phenomena. First, ground-truth communities contain high-degree hub nodes that reside in community overlaps and link to most of the members of the community. Second, the overlaps of communities are more densely connected than the non-overlapping parts of communities. We show that this in contrast to the conventional wisdom that community overlaps are more sparsely connected than the non-overlapping parts themselves. We then show that many existing models of network communities do not capture dense community overlaps. This in turn means that most present models and community detection methods confuse overlaps as separate communities. In contrast, we present the community-affiliation graph model ( AGM), a conceptual model of network community structure. We demonstrate that AGM reliably captures the overall structure of networks as well as the overlapping and hierarchical nature of network communities.",,,,,"Leskovec, Jure/0000-0002-5411-923X",,,,,,,,,,,,2157-6904,2157-6912,,,,APR,2014,5,2,,,SI,,,,26,10.1145/2594454,,,,,,,WOS:000335576200005,,,,,

Its unique idea is to consider topological structure and link similarity separately using two distinct types of graphs: the line graph and the original graph. For topological structure, each link of the original graph is mapped to a node of the link-space graph, which enables us to discover overlapping communities using non-overlapping community detection algorithms as in the line graph. For link similarity, it is calculated on the original graph and carried over into the link-space graph, which enables us to keep the original structure on the transformed graph. Thus, our transformation, by combining these two advantages, facilitates overlapping community detection as well as improves the resulting quality. Based on this framework, we develop the algorithm LinkSCAN that performs structural clustering on the link-space graph. Moreover, we propose the algorithm LinkSCAN* that enhances the efficiency of LinkSCAN by sampling. Extensive experiments were conducted using the LFR benchmark networks as well as some real-world networks.

Since expert knowledge is mostly tacit, the acquisition and sharing of tacit knowledge along with the development of a transactive memory system (TMS) are significant factors in effective software teams. Objective: We seek to enhance our understanding human factors in the software development process and provide support for the agile approach, particularly in its advocacy of social interaction, by answering two questions: How do software development teams acquire and share tacit knowledge? What roles do tacit knowledge and transactive memory play in successful team performance? Method: A theoretical model describing the process for acquiring and sharing tacit knowledge and development of a TMS through social interaction is presented and a second predictive model addresses the two research questions above. The elements of the predictive model and other demographic variables were incorporated into a larger online survey for software development teams, completed by 46 software SMEs, consisting of 181 individual team members. Results: Our results show that team tacit knowledge is acquired and shared directly through good quality social interactions and through the development of a TMS with quality of social interaction playing a greater role than transactive memory. Both TMS and team tacit knowledge predict effectiveness but not efficiency in software teams. Conclusion: It is concluded that TMS and team tacit knowledge can differentiate between low- and high-performing teams in terms of effectiveness, where more effective teams have a competitive advantage in developing new products and bringing them to market. As face-to-face social interaction is key, collocated, functionally rich, domain expert teams are advocated rather than distributed teams, though arguably the team manager may be in a separate geographic location provided that there is frequent communication and effective use of issue tracking tools as in agile teams.

Empirical studies through this model on various real-world online social network data sets reveal three interesting findings. First, it is the adoption of the information pushing mechanism that greatly facilitates the information propagation in OSNs. Second, some global but cost-intensive strategies, such as selecting the ties of higher betweenness centralities for information propagation, no longer have significant advantages. Third, the random selection strategy is more efficient than selecting the strong ties for information propagation in OSNs. Along this line, we provide further explanations by categorizing weak ties into positive and negative ones and reveal the special bridge effect of positive weak ties.

Our results indicate that the proportion of coauthored IS articles in the four journals has doubled over the past 25 years, from merely 40 percent in 1978 to over 80 percent in 2002. However, a significant variation exists in terms of the shape, density, and centralization of knowledge exchange networks across the four subfields of IS - namely, behavioral science, organizational science, computer science, and economic science. For example, the behavioral science subgroup, in terms of internal cohesion among researchers, tends to develop the most dense collaborative relationships, whereas the computer science subgroup is the most fragmented. Moreover, external collaboration across these subfields appears to be limited and severely unbalanced.

The first part is the Triandis theory, which is adapted to understand and foster the determinants of knowledge sharing behavior in PVCs. The second part explores the quantitative relationship between knowledge sharing and security risk reduction expectation. One hundred and forty-two members from the LinkedIn information security groups participated in this study. PLS analysis shows that perceived consequences, affect, and facilitating conditions have significant effects on knowledge sharing behavior. In contrast, social factors have shown insignificant effects on knowledge sharing behavior in information security communities.

This paper proposes a function-modularity intensity, a variation of modularity density (D-value) for evaluating the cohesiveness of a community, which considers links between vertices as well as link weights. The results showed that maximizing the modularity intensity not only can resolve the resolution limits problem, but also achieve better performance for community partition. To further evaluate the function and clarify the weight-topology correlation with communities, we give a simple model to simulate the topology and link weights development for community evolution, and use the modularity intensity to capture communities of networks in each step of this process. In this model, a network is treated as a fuzzy relation, and two operations of the fuzzy relation are used to make the link weights stronger and weaker respectively with the growth of the network in each evolutionary step. By simulation experiments, we found that in the model the modularity intensity catches communities of networks that undergo a gradual transition from faintness to clearness. Our model also reproduces the finding of Granovetter that strong links are confined mainly in tight communities and the links between communities are predominantly weak. From the results above, we believe that the modularity intensity gives a more comprehensive evaluation for communities, and by studying the weight-topology correlation, this model provides a new view for community evolution.

By drawing on IS theories of technology acceptance and IS success, and on theories of social interaction from evolutionary psychology, activity theory, situated action, and distributed cognition, we test the construct of sociability and its antecedents in Second Life-a popular virtual environment.

Indeed much research has focused on the ""effects"" these systems hold, rather than viewing systems as tools to be designed given an understanding of sociocultural context. Acknowledging the cultural practices and belief systems of a set of users may allow systems to be more effectively created and deployed into particular contexts. Emerging research in community information systems and archives has highlighted possible interactions between system design and ethnographic research. These bridges include understanding how communities can begin (1) to create content for their own information systems, (2) to design the database architectures, and (3) to integrate systems within community infrastructures. In this article, I allude to several cultural criticisms that accompany the global proliferation of information technologies. These criticisms can be answered by research that focuses on developing systems based on ethnographic insights. Specifically, I present the research example of Tribal Peace, a cultural information system designed for and by community members of the 19 Native American reservations of San Diego County (California, United States). This case has demonstrated the potential for a community to create an information system that satisfies its own priorities.

Design/methodology/approach - A 2 x 2 x 2 mixed design is used. Temporal distance (near vs distant) and message concreteness (text vs picture) are between-subjects factors; sharing intentions (close friends vs general public) is a within-subjects factor. Findings - Findings indicate that consumers are more likely to share promotional messages with their strong rather than weak ties. If they perceive that purchases will occur soon, concrete promotional messages will more strongly motivate them to share the message with their friends. However, if they perceive that purchases will occur in the distant future, abstract messages are more motivating. The difference occurs because construal-level theory is more effective among strong E-WOM ties. Originality/value - By studying senders' perspectives, the authors make a new theoretical and practical contribution to the emerging literature on E-WOM communication. Specifically, the authors show how senders are persuaded to share information with their strong- or weak-tie audiences according to the concreteness of a message and temporal distance.

These are not found to be incommensurable, but can be used as building blocks for an integrative framework. Ambiguous conceptualisations are frequent. Different conceptualisations tend to emphasize different aspects of information sharing activities: that which is shared; those who are sharing; and the location in which the sharing activities take place. The commonalities of the people involved in information sharing activities are often seen as a ground for the development of information sharing practices.

The traditional definitions of strong ties (with two endpoints in the same community) and weak ties (with two endpoints in different communities) are being challenged by overlapping community structures. Because of their unique nature, the relationships between overlapping nodes and non-overlapping nodes are difficult to classify as strong or weak. In view of this, it is here proposed that the coefficient indicator for overlapping communities was used to redefine node relationships and enable the quantification of strong and weak ties. Next, changes in the quantities of strong and weak ties were analyzed by varying the threshold values of the overlap coefficient. Finally, the effect of weak ties in information dissemination was assessed in overlapping and non-overlapping situations, respectively. Results demonstrated that the overlap coefficient proposed in this paper could better characterize the strong and weak attributes of edges under overlapping community structures.",,,,"Yuan, Peiyan/M-6040-2015","Yuan, Peiyan/0000-0003-0023-1194",,,,,,,,,,,,2169-3536,,,,,,2017,5,,,,,,10012,10016,,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2710360,,,,,,,WOS:000404270600116,,,,,

Among many, one of the fundamental questions is how to predict product adoption, and the answer to this question lays the foundation for product adoption maximization and demand estimation in large social networks. However, due to the inherent challenges resulting from the dynamic diffusion mechanism in online social networks, such as modeling of activation thresholds and influence probability, differentiating between influence and adoption, and incorporating review content, traditional diffusion models are often not adequate enough to predict product adoption accurately. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose a linear threshold-hurdle model to predict product adoption incorporating social network effects. First, we present a fine-grained activation threshold model based on the five categories of adopters. In addition, we identify three operational factors underlying social network effects, including interaction strength, structural equivalence, and social entity similarity, to model influence probabilities. Furthermore, we distinguish influence spread from adoption spread by introducing a tattle state, in which users express opinions without adopting the product. Finally, we introduce the notion of hurdle to capture the monetary aspect in users' decision making process of product adoption. Based on the proposed linear threshold-hurdle model, two data mining methods based on the rough set technique, namely, decision rules and decomposition trees, are employed to predict product adoption in a large social network. An empirical study of Kindle Fire HD 7 in. tablets is used to illustrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed model.

Yet, from aggregators to authenticators, the online landscape today is scattered with intermediaries such as EBay and Verisign, aiming to streamline e-commerce transactions and building consumer trust in EM. The central theme of this paper is to understand the contextual factors that lead to consumers' need to trust intermediaries. In developing our arguments, the paper synthesizes perspectives from information economics, transaction cost economics, and literature on institution-based trust to develop the EM-Trust Framework. Drawing from information economics, the paper contends that EM embody certain inefficiencies, which in turn contribute towards heightening consumer uncertainty, especially under conditions of high information specificity. Heightened consumer uncertainty subsequently reduces consumer trust in EM. It is only in the face of uncertainty and a loss of trust in EM that consumers transfer their need to trust in intermediaries. However, the transference of trust is complete only if agency costs from intermediation lie within consumer thresholds. A mini-case of online mortgage marketplaces is used to illustrate the EM-Trust Framework, thus creating threads for more insightful investigations in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-085X,,,,,FEB,2008,17,1,,,,,12,28,,10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000729,,,,,,,WOS:000253724000003,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach - Similarities between citation patterns and social closeness were identified and discussed. A total of 16 individuals in the citation network were identified and investigated using citation analysis, and a matrix formed of citations made between those in the network. Social connections between the 16 in the citation network were then investigated by means of a questionnaire, the results of which were merged into a separate matrix. These matrices were converted into visual social networks, using multidimensional scaling. A new deviance measure was devised for drawing comparisons between social and citation closeness in individual cases. Findings - Nicholas, Williams and Huntington were found to have cited 527 authors in the period 2000-2003, the 16 most cited becoming the subjects of further citation and social investigation. This comparison, along with the examination of visual representations indicates a positive correlation between social closeness and citation counts. Possible explanations for this correlation are discussed, and implications considered. Despite this correlation, the information scientists were found to cite widely outside their immediate social connections.

The underlying assumption is that attendance at mutual events gives an implicit social network between people. We take an axiomatic approach to this problem. Starting from a list of axioms, which a measure of tie strength must satisfy, we characterize functions that satisfy all the axioms. We then show that there is a range of tie-strength measures that satisfy this characterization. A measure of tie strength induces a ranking on the edges of the social network (and on the set of neighbors for every person). We show that for applications where the ranking, and not the absolute value of the tie strength, is the important thing about the measure, the axioms are equivalent to a natural partial order. To settle on a particular measure, we must make a non-obvious decision about extending this partial order to a total order. This decision is best left to particular applications. We also classify existing tie-strength measures according to the axioms that they satisfy; and observe that none of the ""self-referential"" tie-strength measures satisfy the axioms.

In the absence of any enforcement mechanism or protocol, there is no incentive for one party to directly reciprocate during a transaction with another. Consequently, for such decentralized systems to function, protocols for self-organization need to explicitly promote cooperation in a manner where adherence to the protocol is incentivized. In this article we introduce a new generic model to achieve this. The model is based on peers repeatedly interacting to build up and maintain a dynamic social network of others that they can trust based on similarity of cooperation. This mechanism effectively incentivizes unselfish behavior, where peers with higher levels of cooperation gain higher payoff. We examine the model's behavior and robustness in detail. This includes the effect of peers self-adapting their cooperation level in response to maximizing their payoff, representing a Nash-equilibrium of the system. The study shows that the formation of a social network based on reflexive cooperation levels can be a highly effective and robust incentive mechanism for autonomous decentralized systems.",,,,,"Allen, Stuart/0000-0003-1776-7489",,,,,,,,,,,,1556-4665,1556-4703,,,,FEB,2010,5,1,,,,,,,4,10.1145/1671948.1671952,,,,,,,WOS:000275117800004,,,,,

The problem of finding the top k influential nodes of a directed graph G = (V, E) such that the influence spread of these nodes will be maximized has long been exposed and many algorithms have been proposed to deal with this problem.

Our algorithm is carefully engineered with out-of-core techniques and tailored for modern parallel stream processing engines that run on clusters of shared-nothing commodity hardware. Hence, it is amenable to real-world deployment. We experiment on graphs that are two orders of magnitude larger than previous studies.

Deriving from the relational communication perspective, informational and relational motivations are modeled as the two main antecedents of source preference and sourcing frequency in dyadic information seeking. Through a survey of employee dyads, our findings indicate that perceived information relevance is a significant antecedent of source preference for both task and social information seeking, whereas perceived relational benefit is significant in the context of task information. The results also show that perceived relational benefit has a stronger effect on source preference in task information seeking than in social information seeking. Furthermore, preference for a source is a significant antecedent of the frequency of sourcing in both contexts.

This model seeks to consider the roles of PHAs, their family members/friends and formal health systems in network formation. Design/methodology/approach - In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 114 PHAs, their friends/family members (FFs) and formal caregivers in three rural regions of Canada. A network solicitation procedure elicited PHAs' HIV/AIDS information/help networks. Interviews were analyzed qualitatively, and network data were analyzed statistically. Documents describing health systems in each region were also analyzed. Analyses used social capital theory, supplemented by stress/coping and stigma management theories. Findings - PHAs' HIV/AIDS-related information/help networks emphasized linking and bonding social capital with minimal bridging social capital. This paper presents a model that explains how and why such networks developed. The model shows that networks grew from the actions of PHAs, their FFs and health systems. PHAs experienced considerable stress, which led them to develop information/help networks to cope with HIV/AIDS both individually and collaboratively. Because of stigmatization, many PHAs disclosed their illness selectively, thus constraining the size and composition of their networks. Health system actors created network-building opportunities for PHAs by providing them with care, referrals and support programs.

Further, with the emergence of high speed intemet applications and advanced Web 2.0 based Rich Internet Applications (i.e. blogs, wikis, etc.), it has become much easier for users to publish data over the Web. This brings a challenge for Web search solutions to let individual users find the right information as per their preferences. Different users of the Web may have different preferences. Search results for the same query from different users may differ in priority for individual users. In this paper, we describe our approach of enabling personalized Web search for users based on their preferences. It is a challenge in itself to have the preferences of the users known to and considered by search engines. We have designed and developed our unique approach of finding the preferences of users from the relevant parts of their social networks and communities. We believe that the information related to the queries posed by users may have strong correlation with relevant information in their social networks. In order to find out the personal interests and the social-contexts, we find out (1) activities of users in their social-networks, and (2) relevant information from user's social networks, based on our proposed trust and relevance matrices. We have developed a mechanism that extracts information from a user's social network and uses it to re-rank the results from a search engine. We have also discussed the implementation and evaluation of our proposed solution by emphasizing how it improves the Web search. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Users see these SNSs as useful tools to find friends and interact with them. Moreover, SNSs allow their users to share photos, videos, and express their thoughts and feelings. However, users are usually concerned about their privacy when using SNSs. This is because the public image of a subject can be affected by photos or comments posted on a social network. In this way, recent studies demonstrate that users are demanding better mechanisms to protect their privacy. An appropriate approximation to solve this could be a privacy assistant software agent that automatically suggests a privacy policy for any item to be shared on a SNS. The first step for developing such an agent is to be able to elicit meaningful information that can lead to accurate privacy policy predictions. In particular, the information needed is user communities and the strength of users' relationships, which, as suggested by recent empirical evidence, are the most important factors that drive disclosure in SNSs. Given the number of friends that users can have and the number of communities they may be involved on, it is infeasible that users are able to provide this information without the whole eliciting process becoming confusing and time consuming. In this work, we present a tool called Best Friend Forever (BFF) that automatically classifies the friends of a user in communities and assigns a value to the strength of the relationship ties to each one. We also present an experimental evaluation involving 38 subjects that showed that BFF can significantly alleviate the burden of eliciting communities and relationship strength.",,,,"Espinosa, Agustin/L-5630-2014; Garcia-Fornes, Ana/C-8260-2014","Espinosa, Agustin/0000-0001-8070-3344; Garcia-Fornes, Ana/0000-0003-4482-8793",,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3326,1572-9419,,,,APR,2014,16,2,,,,,225,237,,10.1007/s10796-013-9453-6,,,,,,,WOS:000335231700005,,,,,

In this paper, we hypothesize that the ""check-ins"" made by friends help users learn the potential payoff of visiting a venue. We argue that this learning-in-a-network process differs from the classic observational learning model in a subtle yet important way: Rather than from anonymous others, the agents learn from their network friends, about whose tastes in experience goods the agents are better informed. The empirical analyses are conducted on a unique data set in which we observe both the explicit interpersonal relationships and their ensuing check-ins. The key result is that the proportion of checked-in friends is not positively associated with the likelihood of a new visit, rejecting the prediction of the conventional observational learning model. Drawing on the literature in sociology and computer science, we show that weighting the friends' check-ins by a parsimonious proximity measure can yield a more intuitive result than the plain proportion does. Repeated check-ins by friends are found to have a pronounced effect. Our empirical result calls for the revisiting of observational learning in a social network setting.

Different types of social ties have essentially different influences on people. Awareness of the types of social ties can benefit many applications, such as recommendation and community detection. For example, our close friends tend to move in the same circles that we do, while our classmates may be distributed into different communities. Though a bulk of research has focused on inferring particular types of relationships in a specific social network, few publications systematically study the generalization of the problem of predicting social ties across multiple heterogeneous networks. In this work, we develop a framework referred to as TranFG for classifying the type of social relationships by learning across heterogeneous networks. The framework incorporates social theories into a factor graph model, which effectively improves the accuracy of predicting the types of social relationships in a target network by borrowing knowledge from a different source network. We also present several active learning strategies to further enhance the inferring performance. To scale up the model to handle really large networks, we design a distributed learning algorithm for the proposed model. We evaluate the proposed framework (TranFG) on six different networks and compare with several existing methods. TranFG clearly outperforms the existing methods on multiple metrics. For example, by leveraging information from a coauthor network with labeled advisor-advisee relationships, TranFG is able to obtain an F1-score of 90% (8%-28% improvements over alternative methods) for predicting manager-subordinate relationships in an enterprise email network. The proposed model is efficient.

Accounting for these cognitive limits simplifies mechanics of information diffusion in online social networks and explains puzzling empirical observations: (i) information generally fails to spread in social media and (ii) highly connected people are less likely to re-share information.

It is beneficial in terms of improving the propagation efficiency and information coverage ratio of mobile networks. Furthermore, sufficient experiments were conducted to verify the diffusion performances both over a range of complex network topologies, such as the Watts Strogatz small-world network, the Barabasi Albert scale-free network, the real-world Flickr network, and over a TVG-based mobile network.

An empirical study on 5772 online stores in two industries was conducted to validate the model. For social network factors, socialization efforts in SNS (social network site) personal space and online discussion forums were not found to be related to store survival. Structural assurance, as operationalized by the status of abiding by the ""faithful description"" consumer rights safeguarding program, has a significant impact on store life span. Furthermore, positive WOM, manifested as consistent DSR (Detailed Seller Rating) evaluations, was found to contribute to store survival. However, another WOM indicator, average DSR ratings, was found to be negatively related to store survival. In general, these results confirm some of our earlier hypotheses, while revealing some discrepancies from the theoretical predictions.

Accordingly, the interest in understanding the nature of the information diffusion in the blogosphere has also been increased. Existing studies in social networks have mainly focused on the information diffusion through explicit relationships between members. In this paper, we analyze the causes for the information diffusion without explicit relationships in the blogosphere. BlogCast, a functionality provided by blog-service providers to expose a high quality post on the portal main page, is found to be one of the main causes of the information diffusion without explicit relationships. We analyze the characteristics of the information diffusion through the BlogCast and its halo effect on the bloggers whose post has been exposed on the portal main page. In addition, we examine the sustainability of the halo effect of the BlogCast over time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It advances two questions. First, does social media increase the chances of protest participation at the individual level, as prior research shows for advanced democracies? Second, in a region with glaring economic and political inequalities, does social media deepen or reduce the gaps in protest participation that exist among men and women, the young and the old, different social classes, or people with varying levels of political engagement? Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses cross-sectional Latin American Public Opinion Project survey data from 2012 representing the adult population of 17 Latin American countries. It presents binary logistic regression models with protest participation as the dependent variable, social media use for political purposes as the main independent variable, control variables, and interactions. Findings - Using social media for political purposes significantly increases protest chances - it is the second strongest predictor. Additionally, social media reduces protest gaps associated with individuals' age, gender, psychological engagement with politics, and recruitment networks. Originality/value - First, the paper shows that the contribution of social media to collective protest travels beyond advanced democracies - it also holds for more unequal regions with weaker democratic trajectories like Latin America.

A challenge in managing a VoIP network is to detect spam calls without user involvement or content analysis. In this paper we present a novel content independent, non-intrusive approach based on caller trust and reputation to block spam callers in a VoIP network. Our approach uses call duration, interaction rate, and caller out-degree distribution to establish a trust network between VoIP users and computes the global reputation of a caller across the network. Our approach uses historical information for automatically determining a global reputation threshold below which a caller is declared as socially non-connected and as a spammer. No VoIP data-set is available for testing the detection mechanism. We verify the accuracy of our approach with synthetic data that we generate by randomly varying the call duration, call rate, and out-degree distributions of spammers and legitimate users. This evaluation shows that our approach can automatically detect spam callers in a network. Our approach achieves a false positive rate of less than 10% and true positive rate of almost 80% in the first two days even in the presence of a significant number of spammers. This increases to a true positive rate of 99% and drops a false positive rate to less than 2% on the third day. In a network with no spammers, our approach achieves a false positive rate of less than 10%. In a network heavily saturated with more than 60% of spam callers, our approach achieves a true positive rate of 98% and no false positives. We compare the performance of our approach with a closely related spam detection approach named Call-Rank. The results show that our approach outperforms Call-Rank in terms of detection accuracy and detection time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The social media applications were examined with regard to the following aspects: types of social media, placement of social media, updating social media, types of interactions, and types of functions. Findings - This study presents the types of social media applications in the selected digital libraries and further characterises their placements, update frequency, types of interactions between digital librarians and users, as well as various types of roles they played.

Thus a large body of OSS studies focuses on studying the developers' participation motivations. One important motivation is an OSS developer's desire to gain good community reputation which is largely based on positive evaluations from his peers. Therefore, to better motivate developers' project participations through their reputation needs, our empirical analysis adopted a social network perspective to study what factors may affect a developer's decision to positively evaluate one other in a large online open source community called Ohloh. The results surprisingly show that a developer's positive evaluation decision does not depend on his evaluatee's level of OSS-related experience, but rather based on 1) his past reputation (i.e. existing number of positive evaluations), 2) their shared affiliations such as mutual acquaintances, as well as 3) their homophily in location (city), nationality, programming language preference, and community status. We then discuss these findings and their implications for inducing more positive evaluations and better reputation management among open source project members. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first research that investigates issues of reputation building and relationship management in an open source development context.

Through the analysis of OSNs, many social phenomena have been studied, such as the viral diffusion of information amongst people. What is still unclear is the relation between micro-level structural properties of OSNs (i.e. the properties of the personal networks of the users, also known as ego networks) and the emergence of such phenomena. A better knowledge of this relation could be essential for the creation of services for the Future Internet, such as highly personalised advertisements fitted on users' needs and characteristics. In this paper, we contribute to bridge this gap by analysing the ego networks of a large sample of Facebook and Twitter users. We show that micro-level structural properties of OSNs are interestingly similar to those found in social networks formed offline. In particular, online ego networks show the same structure found offline, with social contacts arranged in layers with compatible size and composition. From the analysis of Twitter ego networks, we have been able to find a direct impact of tie strength and ego network circles on the diffusion of information in the network. Specifically, there is a high correlation between the frequency of direct contact between users and her friends in Twitter (a proxy for tie strength), and the frequency of retweets made by the users from tweets generated by their friends. We analysed the correlation for each ego network layer identified in Twitter, discovering their role in the diffusion of information. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, the prevailing deficiency of each of these methods is that they perform well only when we consider their objective of interest as the only characteristic the set of key players should have. But in complicated real life applications, we need a set of key players which can perform well with respect to multiple objectives of interest. In this paper, we propose a new perspective for key player identification, based on optimizing multiple objectives of interest. This method allows us to compare other methods of key player identification. The sets of key players identified by this method are better when multiple objectives must be addressed. In addition we propose an algorithm to select the most suitable sets of key players when multiple choices are available. To reduce the computational complexity of the proposed approach for large networks, we propose a new sampling approach based on Degree centrality. We apply these algorithms in eventual influence limitation (EIL) problem and immunization problem and show that our multi-objective methodology outperforms previous key player identification approaches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1869-5450,1869-5469,,,,DEC,2015,5,1,,,,,,,21,10.1007/s13278-015-0260-6,,,,,,,WOS:000355743100021,,,,,

However, empirical evidence has yet to be found illustrating whether and how such applications have affected job performance. Drawing upon social network theory, we postulate a conceptual model suggesting that employees' online social relationships accumulated through work-and nonwork-related blog participation will engender different effects on job performance. The model is empirically tested using digital trace and archival data collected from two in-practice systems of a large telecommunications company. The results reveal that, in the workrelated blog network, the structural and cognitive dimensions of social relationships positively affect job performance, whereas the relational dimension shows a negative influence. Meanwhile, participation in nonwork-related blog network benefits job performance for employees with a high level of performance in the previous time period, but is detrimental for other employees. The findings uncover the influencing mechanism of corporate blogging on job performance and offer practical advice for managers to better exploit the value of intraorganizational social media.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0742-1222,1557-928X,,,,,2015,32,4,,,,,285,314,,10.1080/07421222.2015.1138573,,,,,,,WOS:000386871900010,,,,,

Ego networks capture all the social relationships (links) between an ego and all the other people with whom the ego has a social tie. Ego networks are one of the key social structure that have been studied in the anthropology literature, and is thus a reference objective for our work. In this paper we analyze a number of quantitative variables that can be collected on Facebook, which can be used to describe the properties of the social links in ego networks. We also analyze the correlation between these variables and the strength of the social ties, as explicitly ranked by the monitored Facebook users.

In this paper, we propose an approach for trust management in P2P systems.

We identify latent heterogeneity among our subjects, establishing that for users with a large number of Facebook friends, the only measure associated with trust is whether the dyad was tagged in a photo together. In contrast, for users that are more selective and have fewer Facebook friends, all three aforementioned tie strength measures correlate with trust.

Given the powerful information dissemination capabilities, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been suggested as interventions to build infant care awareness and to modify healthcare behaviors. We examine how the use of one ICT intervention-specifically, eHealth kiosks disseminating authenticated and accessible medical information-can alleviate the problem of high infant mortality in rural India. We investigate how mothers' social networks affect their use of eHealth kiosks, seeking professional medical care for their infants and, ultimately, infant mortality. Drawing on the social epidemiology and social networks literatures, we focus on advice and hindrance from both strong and weak ties as the conduit of social influence on mothers' health-related behaviors for the care of their infants. Over a period of 7 years, we studied 4,620 infants across 10 villages where the eHealth kiosks were implemented along with support resources for proxy use. The results revealed that (1) eHealth kiosk use promotes seeking professional medical care and reduces infant mortality, (2) mothers are especially vulnerable to hindrance from both strong and weak ties as they choose to maintain the status quo of traditional infant healthcare practices (e.g., reliance on untrained personnel, superstitions, fatalism) in villages, and (3) advice from both strong and weak ties offers the potential to break down misplaced beliefs about infant healthcare practices and to develop literacy on seeking professional medical care. In contrast, in a comparative group of 10 neighboring villages, the reduction in infant mortality was not as pronounced and the effect of professional medical care in reducing infant mortality was lower. Our findings suggest that an ICT intervention can effectively address one of society's most important problems (i.e., infant mortality) even in parts of the world with limited resources and deep suspicion of technology and change. Overall, we believe such an ICT intervention will complement other investments being made, including the facilitation of use (proxy use) and provision of professional medical facilities to reduce infant mortality.",,,,,"Rai, Arun/0000-0002-3655-7543",,,,,,,,,,,,0276-7783,,,,,JUN,2016,40,2,,,SI,,353,380,,10.25300/MISQ/2016/40.2.04,,,,,,,WOS:000376783300004,,,,,

Examples include ego network analysis, motif counting, finding social circles, personalized recommendations, link prediction, anomaly detection, analyzing influence cascades, and others. These tasks are not well served by existing vertex-centric graph processing frameworks, where user programs are only able to directly access the state of a single vertex at a time, resulting in high communication, scheduling, and memory overheads in executing such tasks. Further, most existing graph processing frameworks ignore the challenges in extracting the relevant portions of the graph that an analysis task is interested in, and loading those onto distributed memory. This paper introduces NScale, a novel end-to-end graph processing framework that enables the distributed execution of complex subgraph-centric analytics over large-scale graphs in the cloud. NScale enables users to write programs at the level of subgraphs rather than at the level of vertices. Unlike most previous graph processing frameworks, which apply the user program to the entire graph, NScale allows users to declaratively specify subgraphs of interest. Our framework includes a novel graph extraction and packing (GEP) module that utilizes a cost-based optimizer to partition and pack the subgraphs of interest into memory on as few machines as possible. The distributed execution engine then takes over and runs the user program in parallel on those subgraphs, restricting the scope of the execution appropriately, and utilizes novel techniques to minimize memory consumption by exploiting overlaps among the subgraphs. We present a comprehensive empirical evaluation comparing against three state-of-the-art systems, namely Giraph, GraphLab, and GraphX, on several real-world datasets and a variety of analysis tasks.

Architecture considers aggregation and synthesis of information from multiple sources, social system interoperability, and integration with the user's primary work context. Lastly, evaluation focuses on assessment of collaboration decisions, measurement of user-specific costs and benefits, and how the large-scale impact of RNS could be evaluated with longitudinal and naturalistic methods.

By analysing 325 survey responses of eight research and development groups from five firms with structural equation modelling, we found that network centrality and organizational reward were influential only on open knowledge transfer while expected reciprocity was influential only on closed knowledge transfer.

A sociological perspective is introduced as the theoretical basis to analyze scientific fields, and the social network framework is adopted to develop a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the organization of science. This approach is then applied to study the Spanish Library and Information Science community from 1999 to 2007. The underlying notion is that science is organized work, in which the pursuit of impact shapes the specific scientific organization. This generates mutual dependence and control among researchers, which may restrict access when formally communicating with other scientific communities. On the other hand, scholarly journals facilitate the coordination of new knowledge and serve as platforms for interaction among scientists. Consequently, the interaction of well-defined groups of homogenous researchers, concentrated around particular sets of journals, leads to the formation of cohesive (sub)groups tied together by the degree of similarity of the researchers' competence. An empirical test suggests that this consideration can accurately reveal a segment of the structure of the scientific field.

However, in an open network, uncontrolled sharing and transmission mode of digital content between users create considerable problems regarding digital rights management (DRM). This paper aims to explore potential paths on the propagation of copyrighted contents. An approach to mining credible potential paths is proposed for MSNs. The formal descriptions were primarily based on rough set theory for mining potential paths. Trust was also measured to find credible potential paths. We presented related algorithms for mining two kinds of paths between any two nodes. Finally, we conducted an experiment based on three non-overlapped sharing communities multiplied by 150 nodes. In the communities found by using a representative real-world MSN YouTube dataset, we further mine the general and credible potential paths based on the simulated trust assessment values. The proposed method could effectively and accurately mine two kinds of potential paths of copyrighted digital content distribution and sharing, which can help to resolve critical DRM issues.",,,,,"ZHANG, Zhiyong/0000-0003-3061-7768",,,,,,,,,,,,0010-4620,1460-2067,,,,APR,2015,58,4,,,,,668,678,,10.1093/comjnl/bxu035,,,,,,,WOS:000359137500011,,,,,

However, for simplicity, most methods for community detection always model the systems as an undirected graph. In this paper, we propose a new framework that unifies undirected into directed graphs by a function, which creates a mapping that transforms an undirected graph into its two directed modes for community detection. We take the method of modularity optimization as an example and apply it on our framework to uncover community structure in complex networks. Compared with the original modularity optimization, we find that the modularity optimization on our framework not only achieves better results on the LFR benchmark, but also a more detailed subdivision on the Zachary club network and the American college football network. Based on the results above, we confirm that our framework provides a good platform for community detection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Accordingly, we conduct a laboratory experiment using teenagers and their parents as subjects, increasing the realism of the context by sampling potential pirates and their parents. Treatments represent various sources of piracy advice (e.g., the teen's parent, a record label, or an external regulator). Subjects make decisions playing our new experimental game-The Piracy Game-extended from the volunteer's dilemma literature. Interestingly, subjects respond negatively to advice from record labels over time, purchasing fewer songs as compared to other sources such as the subject's parent. The existence of a social tie between the adviser and the subject assists in mitigating piracy, especially when a parent is facing potential penalties due to his or her child's behavior. An external regulator, having no social tie or stake in the decision, provides the least credible source of advice, leading to the greatest amount of piracy.

Tie strength describes the strength of a social relationship. In the past, SNA literature with a knowledge management context has often emphasized the importance of strong and/or weak ties rather than of intermediate (medium strong) ties in a social network.

Intermediate ties also help connect otherwise weakly linked organisations. Moreover, a definition of intermediate ties in the context of knowledge management is introduced.

In turn, we propose a model to predict repliers and retweeters given a particular tweet posted at a certain time in a microblog-based social network. More specifically, we have devised a learning to -rank approach to train a ranker that considers elaborate user level and tweet-level features (like sentiment, self-disclosure, and responsiveness) to address these dynamics. In the prediction phase, a tweet posted by a user is deemed a query and the predicted repliers/retweeters are retrieved using the learned ranker. We have collected a large dataset containing 73.3 million dyadic relationships with their interactions (replies and retweets). Extensive experimental results based on this dataset show that by incorporating the dynamics of friendship relations, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of multiple evaluation metrics, such as MAP, NDCG and Topmost Accuracy.

Mobility patterns and their impact in such networks have been extensively studied. In contrast, this has not been the case with communication traffic patterns, where homogeneous traffic between all nodes is usually assumed. This assumption is generally not true, as node mobility and social characteristics can significantly affect the end-to-end traffic demand between them. To this end, in this paper, we explore the joint effect of traffic patterns and node mobility on the performance of popular forwarding mechanisms, both analytically and through simulations. Among the different insights stemming from our analysis, we identify conditions under which heterogeneity renders the added value of using extra relays more/less useful. Furthermore, we confirm the intuition that an increasing amount of heterogeneity closes the performance gap between different forwarding policies, making end-to-end routing more challenging in some cases, or less necessary in others.

Design/methodology/approach - This study developed a program and an online questionnaire to collect the data set from Facebook, and then integrated that data set with a subjective data set consisting of participants' opinions of the strength of their friendships on Facebook. The model developed here for predicting tie strength performed well when was applied on a data set of 6,477 SNSs' ties, distinguishing between strong and weak ties with over 50 percent accuracy. Findings - The results developed an algorithm (predictive model) that quantifies and measures tie strength continuously to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The results found that the variables in the dimension of emotional intensity had stronger effects than other interaction variables. Originality/value - This study developed a predictive model that helps explain the meaning of interaction on SNSs, providing an efficient method to examine tie strength on SNSs. The tie strength estimates can also be used to improve the range and performance of various aspects of SNSs, including link predictions, product recommendations, newsfeeds, people searches, and visualization. Such understanding of the structure of SNSs might lead ultimately to the design of algorithms that can detect trusted or influential users of SNSs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1066-2243,,,,,,2015,25,2,,,,,218,238,,10.1108/IntR-11-2013-0231,,,,,,,WOS:000352105300004,,,,,

Because of a common focus on communication, these perspectives can be combined as a set of methodologies. Latour's sociology of translations specifies a mechanism for generating variation in relations (associations), whereas Luhmann's systems perspective enables the specification of (functionally different) selection environments such as markets, professional organizations, and political control. Selection environments can be considered as mechanisms of social coordination that can self-organizebeyond the control of human agencyinto regimes in terms of interacting codes of communication. Unlike relatively globalized regimes, technological trajectories are organized locally in landscapes. A resulting duality of structure (Giddens, 1979) between the historical organization of trajectories and evolutionary self-organization at the regime level can be expected to drive innovation cycles. Reflexive translations add a third layer of perspectives to (a) the relational analysis of observable links that shape trajectories and (b) the positional analysis of networks in terms of latent dimensions. These three operations can be studied in a single framework, but using different methodologies. Latour's first-order associations can then be analytically distinguished from second-order translations in terms of requiring other communicative competencies. The resulting operations remain infrareflexively nested, and can therefore be used for innovative reconstructions of previously constructed boundaries.",,,,"Leydesdorff, Loet/E-2903-2010","Leydesdorff, Loet/0000-0002-7835-3098",,,,,,,,,,,,2330-1635,2330-1643,,,,NOV,2014,65,11,,,,,2359,2374,,10.1002/asi.23127,,,,,,,WOS:000344225200015,,,,,

Results Direct network effects caused by common patients among physicians are much more influential on HIE adoption as compared with previously investigated social contagion and external factors. Professional proximity due to common patients does influence adoption decisions; geographical proximity is also influential, but its effect is more on rural than urban physicians.

It utilizes the spreading-activation theory of human long-term memories from social psychology to extract information and graph-theoretic linguistic approximations supporting rational propositional inference and formalisms. Using an empirical case study we demonstrate the process of extracting linguistic concepts from data and training a Hopfield artificial neural network for semantic network classification. We further develop an agent-based computational model of network evolution in order to study the processes and patterns of collective semantic knowledge representation, introducing incidents of collapses in central network structures. Large ensembles of simulation replication experiments are conducted and the resulted networks are analyzed using a variety of estimation techniques. We show how collective social structure emerges from simple interactions among semantic categories. Our findings provide evidence of the significance of collapse and reorganization effects in the structure of collective social knowledge; the statistical importance of the within-factor interactions in network evolution, and; stochastic exploration of whole parameter spaces in large ensembles of simulation runs can reveal important self-organizing aspects of the system's behavior. The last session discusses the results and revisits the issues of generative semantic inference and the semantic networks as inferential formalisms in guiding self-organizing systemic complexity.

They require considerable investments in personnel, time and money and impact just about every aspect of software firms. The group charged with conducting an SPI project has, however, little formal authority to influence or force software professionals to engage in SPI work or to define and implement changes. The SPI literature suggests that successful SPI initiatives depend on strong commitment from top management. But what should the SPI group do if management support is weak? In this paper, we present an analysis of how an SPI group can use alliances to obtain influence and succeed when management support is weak. Our study is based on a 3-year longitudinal field study of SPI change initiatives at Denmark Electronics. Our findings show that a lack of top management support is not necessarily incompatible with success.

Past studies have focused on online WOM effects by measuring WOM volume and valence. However, few studies have investigated how the entropy of the review text sentiment influences the relationship between online WOM and product sales. As WOM valence and volume are usually provided at an aggregated level, consumers often do not have enough information to make a decision. In this case, reading online review text has become an important process for consumers to make purchasing decisions. However, when consumers encounter too many positive review texts, they may doubt the credibility of online WOM itself. Thus, we analyzed the entropy of the review text sentiments by conducting text-mining techniques. We classified review text sentiment into positive, negative, and neutral categories and created an entropy variable. A high level of entropy in review texts indicates that sentiment from review texts are equally distributed, but not biased, towards positive or negative sentiment. We estimated our research model with the entropy variable in a panel dataset for 204 movies over a half-year period. The results suggest that the entropy level in the review texts has a positive moderating impact on the relationship between WOM (e. g., valence and volume) and movie box office sales. The findings imply that deleting negative reviews to enhance product sales may not help online retailers or related parties. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Community-based link prediction methods are proposed to incorporate community information in order to achieve accurate prediction. However, the performance of such methods is sensitive to the selection of community detection algorithms, and they also fail to capture the correlation between link formulation and community evolution. In this paper we introduce a balanced Modularity-Maximization Link Prediction (MMLP) model to address this issue. The idea of MMLP is to integrate the formulation of two types of links into a partitioned network generative model. We proposed a probabilistic algorithm to emphasize the role of innerLinks, which correspondingly maximizes the network modularity. Then, a trade-off technique is designed to maintain the network in a stable state of equilibrium. We also present an effective feature aggregation method by exploring two variations of network features. Our proposed method can overcome the limit of several community-based methods and the extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world benchmark data demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.

We provide empirical evidence that contribution to knowledge communities leads to a higher likelihood of job-hopping, yet a greater amount of learning is associated with a higher probability of retention. We argue that the effect of contribution can be attributed to job market signaling and the effect of learning is primarily driven by enhanced job performance and career advancement within the current organization.

In particular, the notion of social capital highlights a person's benefit due to his relations with other persons, including family, colleagues, friends and generic contacts. It may be important both for the individuals that are able to accumulate large amounts, and for organizations. Nowadays, social networking systems bring many acquaintances online, both in the private and working spheres. Some systems are used both at home, for leisure goals, and on the work place, professionally. In the vast majority of cases, social networking platforms are still used without corporate blessing. However, several traditional information systems, such as CRMs and ERPs, have also been modified in order to include social aspects.

Examining fans' online mourning practices on YouTube, this paper examines video tributes dedicated to the late Steve Jobs, with a focus on collective remembering and collective construction of memory. Combining netnography with critical discourse analysis, the analysis focuses on the user comments where the past unfolds in interaction and meanings are negotiated and contested. The paper argues that celebrity death may, for avid fans, be a source of disenfranchised grief, a type of grief characterised by inadequate social support, usually arising from lack of empathy for the loss. The paper sheds light on the functions digital memorials have for mourning fans (and fandom) and argues that social media sites have come to function as spaces of negotiation, legitimisation and alleviation of disenfranchised grief.

With stress on the communication and socialization aspects of online gaming, we need different perspectives from those of the past to investigate online gaming and draw on social capital theory. By socially interacting with other gamers, the online gamer not only builds new relationships (bridging social capital), but he/she also strengthens existing relationships (bonding social capital). However, previous research has concentrated only on one of these types of user interactions, and has not analyzed interactions for both bridging and bonding social capital at the same time.

Design/methodology/approach - In order to meet this aim the authors conducted an empirical study of 100 regional newspapers supplying news media services in the UK. Two hypotheses grounded in a conceptual model were developed. The authors used Pearson correlation and (stepwise) regression analysis to test two hypotheses (H1 and H2). Findings - H1 provides us with some interesting findings. The first is that higher priced newspapers attract more unique Internet users and mobile Internet access. Higher priced newspapers who have been in business longer and have established brands attract more online readers. Also, because these issues are more expensive there is more incentive to go online to read the papers for free. Note that this last explanation is consistent with the analysis provided for H2, the beta for price is negative. The negative coefficient indicates that the circulation change of higher priced papers has reduced more. Therefore circulation change impacts greater upon premium price newspapers for an elite rather than a broad readership. The regression results presented here indicate that established firms with premium pricing, providing multiple platform distribution and specialist digital editions with free online content, have circulations that are reducing less. Practical implications - While reducing the rate of circulation decline, current levels of online presence are not reversing it. There is a need for online presence to be focused on more targeted segments/niches of circulation such as ""hyper-local"" news. This suggests a much clearer consideration must be made by newspapers with a premium price for an elite rather than a broad readership. Social implications - News organizations now find themselves less socially relevant as consumers turn towards the Internet for alternative sources of ""news"". News media firms are having to rebuild their brand identity and market positioning in the online marketplace. Higher priced newspapers have been in business longer and have established brand recognition for providing elite services. This is vital if they are to retain their community influence (as trusted sources of locally produced news, analysis and investigative reporting into public affairs). Commercial influence is determined by their social influence and the demise of newspapers would significantly threaten news plurality, democracy and public service journalism at the local community level. Originality/value - The originality of this work concerns its specific focus on the influence of print/online synergy on the rate of circulation change. The news media industry is an under-researched area of Internet scholarship. The study is significant on two counts: first, it estimates cross-media synergies based on print and online interaction at an aggregated level; and second, it identifies different combinations of cross-media exposure over individual media effects. It combines both print and online measures of circulation. Of most importance, the study is able to show that synergy is complementary and has had a positive effect on log circulation change by reducing it by a smaller number.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1066-2243,,,,,,2013,23,1,,,,,89,108,,10.1108/10662241311295791,,,,,,,WOS:000315014600005,,,,,

However, the underlying mechanism through which eWOM social ties impart influence remains unclear. This study develops a moderated mediation model that incorporates perceived value to explain the effects of eWOM social ties (strong-tie and weak-tie eWOM) on purchase intentions. The research model and hypotheses are empirically test with 286 valid responses. Results reveal a double-edge"" moderating role of weak-tie eWOM. Weak-tie eWOM is found to positively moderate the relationship between perceived value and purchase intentions, while it has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between strong-tie eWOM and purchase intentions. Furthermore, when weak-tie eWOM is high, there is a significant indirect effect of strong-tie eWOM on purchase intentions through perceived value, whereas the indirect effect becomes non-significant under a low level of weak-tie eWOM.

A typical approach used in recommendations is collaborative filtering. However, because it largely relies on external relations, such as items-to-items or users-to-users, problems occur when the relations are biased or insufficient. Focusing on that limitation, we here suggest a new method, item-network-based collaborative filtering, which recommends items through four steps. First, the system constructs item networks based on users' item usage history and calculates three types of centrality: betweenness, closeness, and degree. Next, the system secures significant items based on the betweenness centrality of the items in each user's item network. Then, by using the closeness and degree centrality of the secured items, the algorithm predicts preference scores for items and their rank orders from each user's perspective. In the last step, the system organizes a recommendation list based on the predicted scores. To evaluate the performance of our system, we applied it to a sample dataset of 196 Last.fm users' listening history and compared the results with those from existing collaborative filtering methods. The results showed that the suggested method performed better than the basic item-based and user-based collaborative filtering methods in terms of Accuracy, Recall, and F1 scores for top-k recommendations. This indicates that an individual user's item relations can be utilized to remedy the problems occurring when the external relations are biased or insufficient. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The metric backbone is the minimum subgraph that preserves the shortest paths of a weighted graph. We use the metric backbone in place of the original graph to compute various graph metrics exactly or with good approximation. By computing on a smaller graph, we improve the performance of graph analytics applications on two different systems, a batch graph processing system and a graph database. Further, we provide an algorithm for the computation of the metric backbone on large graphs. While one can compute the metric backbone by solving the all-pairs-shortest paths problem, this approach incurs prohibitive time and space complexity for big graphs. Instead, we propose a heuristic that makes computing the metric backbone practical even for large graphs. Additionally, we analyze several real datasets of different sizes and domains and we show that we can approximate the metric backbone by removing only first-order semi-metric edges; edges for which a shorter two-hop path exists. We provide a distributed implementation of our algorithm and apply it in large scale scenarios. We evaluate our algorithm using a variety of real graphs, including a Facebook social network subgraph of similar to 50 billion edges.

Prior research has rarely addressed the fact that the effect of tie strength moderated by recommender experience is mediated by the effect of message credibility on intention. The final sample comprised 302 students who participated in a 3 (tie strength: strong vs. weak vs. no tie) by 2 (experience: high vs. low) between-subject experiment. Multivariate analysis of covariance and bias-corrected bootstrapping analysis using the PROCESS macro were used to test the hypotheses. The results showed that tie strength and recommender experience positively affect message credibility and intentions. Further, recommender experience moderates the effect of tie strength on intentions, while the moderating effects on intention are mediated by message credibility. While prior research suggests that negative recommendations from people with strong ties affect message effectiveness, the results of the present study deviate from this and show that recommendations from weak ties are as persuasive as those from strong ties when the message is delivered by recommenders with experience.

Revealing the community structure of such systems is crucial in helping us better understand their complex nature. However, the ever-increasing size of real-world graphs, and our evolving perception of what a community is, make the task of community detection very challenging. One such challenge, is the discovery of the possibly overlapping communities of a given node in a billion-node graph. This problem is very common in modern large social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn. In this paper, we propose a scalable local community detection approach to efficiently unfold the communities of individual target nodes in a given network. Our goal is to reveal the groupings formed around nodes (e.g., users) by leveraging the relations of the different contexts the nodes participate in. Our algorithm, termed Local Dispersion-aware Link Communities or LDLC, measures the similarity of pairs of links in the graph as well as the extent of their participation in multiple contexts. Then, it determines the ordering that we should group the links in order to form communities. Our approach is not affected by constraints existent in previous techniques (e.g., the need for several seed nodes or the need to collapse multiple overlapping communities to one). Our experimental evaluation using ground-truth communities for a wide range of large realworld networks show that LDLC significantly outperforms stateof- the-art methods on both accuracy and efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-4673-9005-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,716,725,,,,,,,,,WOS:000399115000085,,,,,

Moreover, for general networks, we derive upper bounds on the order of the spreading time achieved by certain simple (random/greedy) external-spreading policies. Conversely, for certain common classes of networks such as line graphs, grids, and random geometric graphs, we also derive lower bounds on the order of the spreading time over all (potentially network-state aware and adversarial) external-spreading policies; these adversarial lower bounds match (up to logarithmic factors) the spreading time achieved by an external agent with a random spreading policy.

Nevertheless, most of existing analysis models consider only the structural aspect of emerged communities. We are interested in studying the robustness of emerged communities in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. More precisely, we consider the emerged communities in the induced graph by all the exchanges in these networks. Hence, rather than examining the robustness only on the structural properties of the graph, we will focus on the parameters that allow the emergence of community structures. In fact, perturbing these parameters might destroy most of the obtained properties at the emerged level. To the best of our knowledge, robustness of networks has never been considered from this angle before.

A study for the social news aggregator Digg.com,COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,"The key feature of online social networks (OSN) is the ability of users to become active, make friends and interact via comments, videos or messages with those around them. This social interaction is typically perceived as critical to the proper functioning of these platforms; therefore, a significant share of OSN research in the recent past has investigated the characteristics and importance of these social links, studying the networks' friendship relations through their topological properties, the structure of the resulting communities and identifying the role and importance of individual members within these networks. In this paper, we present results from a multi-year study of the online social network Digg.com, indicating that the importance of friends and the friend network in the propagation of information is less than originally perceived. While we do note that users form and maintain a social structure along which information is exchanged, the importance of these links and their contribution is very low: users with even a nearly identical overlap in interests react on average only with a probability of 2% to information propagated and received from friends. Furthermore, in only about 50% of stories that became popular from the entire body of 10 million news we find evidence that the social ties among users were a critical ingredient to the successful spread. Our findings indicate the presence of previously unconsidered factors, the temporal alignment between user activities and the existence of additional logical relationships beyond the topology of the social graph, that are able to drive and steer the dynamics of such OSNs.

This information, in turn, can be used for marketing purposes to acquire new clients or sell products to existing clients. A Decision Support System (DSS) can help a manager to decide the sequence of clients to contact to reach a designed target. In this paper we present the BIG CHASE, a DSS that translates bank data into a reliability graph. This graph models relationships based on a probability of traversal function that includes social measures. The proposed DSS, developed in close collaboration with Banco Santander, S.A., fits the parameters of the probability function to explicit solution evaluations given by experts by means of a specifically designed Projected Gradient Descent algorithm. The fitted probability function determines the reliabilities associated to the edges of the graph. An optimization procedure tailored to be efficient on very large sparse graphs with millions of nodes and edges identifies the most reliable sequence of clients that a manager should contact to reach a specific target. The BIG CHASE has been tested with a case study on real data that includes Banco Santander, S.A. 2015 Spain bank records. Experimental results show that the proposed DSS is capable of modeling the experts' evaluations into probability function with a small error. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study produces new information about the information needs in the construction of the transgendered identity, the changing of the information needs during this phase, utilized information sources, information sharing and barriers encountered in the information behaviour displayed by transgendered people. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were used to explore the information behaviour of 12 transgendered participants. This study represents a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach. A qualitative content analysis was used in analysing the data with categories derived from previous research and research questions. Findings - Serendipity played an important role at the beginning of the participants' information seeking phase: the young individual would not have terms corresponding to his or her experience because of the invisibility of the transgender phenomenon in the culture. The barriers to seeking information were psychological, demographic, role-related or interpersonal, environmental or source characteristic. Fear was apparent as a barrier in the surrounding culture often caused by expectations, attitudes in the family environment and people around. Source characteristic barriers were related to the lack of terms and vocabulary required to seek information and also the lack of the information itself. Information about transgender and gender minorities was essential in building up a clear gender identity, and the most relevant information sources of this sort of information this were other transgendered people and the experience-based information they had shared.

Friend recommendation systems, as an important emerging component of social media, may efficiently expand social media networks by proactively recommending new and potentially high-quality friends to users. Literature review has shown that prior research work on friend recommendation mainly focuses on the linking relation between users in social media but largely neglects the influence of users' attributes. In this study, we have systematically reviewed and evaluated the existing state-of-the-art friend recommendation algorithms. We introduce a new Friend Recommendation system using a User's Total Attributes Information (FRUTAI) based on the law of total probability. The proposed method can be easily extended according to the increasing number of a user's attributes with low computation cost. Furthermore, the FRUTAI is a universal friend recommendation method and can be applied in different types of social media because it does not distinguish the structure of the network. We have collected 7 million users' public information and their friend relationships from RenRen, commonly regarded as the Facebook of China. Using the real-world data from a dominant social media provider, we extensively evaluate the proposed method with other existing friend recommendation algorithms. Our experimental results have demonstrated the comparatively better performance of FRUTAI. In our empirical studies, we have observed that the performance of FRUTAI is related to the number of a user's friends. In particular, when a user has a small number of friends, the proposed FRUTAI algorithm performs better than other algorithms; when a user has a large number of friends, the overall performance of FRUTAI becomes less competitive but is still comparable to those of other providers, and its precision rate is quite outstanding. Our findings may provide some important practical implications to social media design and performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Social networking features open opportunities for information discovery, social collaborations, and improved recommendations of potential collaborators. Objective: Online community and development platforms rely on social network features to increase awareness and attention among community members for improved collaborations. The objective of this work is to introduce an approach for recommending relevant users to follow. Follower networks provide means for informal information propagation. The efficiency and effectiveness of such information flows is impacted by the network structure. Here, we aim to understand the resilience of networks against random or strategic node removal. Method: Social network features of online software development communities present a new opportunity to enhance online collaboration. Our approach is based on the automatic analysis of user behavior and network structure. The proposed 'who to follow' recommendation algorithm can be parametrized for specific contexts. Link-analysis techniques such as PageRank/HITS provide the basis for a novel 'who to follow' recommendation model. Results: We tested the approach using a GitHub-based dataset. Currently, users follow popular community members to get updates regarding their activities instead of maintaining personal relations. Thus, social network features require further improvements to increase reciprocity. The application of our who to follow' recommendation model using the GitHub dataset shows excellent results with respect to context-sensitive following recommendations. The sensitivity of GitHub's follower network to random node removal is comparable with other social networks but more sensitive to follower authority based node removal. Conclusion: Link-based algorithm can be used for context-sensitive 'who to follow' recommendations. GitHub is highly sensitive to authority based node removal. Information flow established through follower relations will be strongly impacted if many authorities are removed from the network. This underpins the importance of 'central' users and the validity of focusing the 'who to follow' recommendations on those users. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Sociologists point out that companies prefer familiar partners in the commercial environment. Using this principle, a concept of partner circle is defined, which can significantly reduce the search space in path planning. Combining path planning with service composition, a PartnerFirst algorithm is presented based on the social network, which is the cooperation network of service providers here. Simulation experiment shows that the PartnerFirst algorithm outperforms current approaches over 10 times in efficiency, with just about 10% loss in QoS.

We collected data in seven comprehensive case studies, including 88 interviews and corresponding surveys, and applied social network analysis to show that three social structures at the implementation level influence the degree to which IT applications are maintained and enhanced in line with business requirements: (1) interface actors connecting business and IT, (2) the relationships between interface actors and the corresponding unit, and (3) the relationships between interface actors and other employees in their unit. In three cases, less favorable structures are revealed that correspond to low application change effectiveness and software applications that do not meet business requirements.

While in asynchronous message-passing systems such ordering of events requires the construction of message chains based on Lamport's happened-before relation, this is no longer true in the presence of time bounds on message delivery. Given such bounds, the mere passage of time can provide information about the occurrence of events at remote sites, without the need for explicit confirmation. A new causal structure called the centipede is introduced, and it is shown that centipedes must exist in every execution where linear ordering of actions is ensured. Centipedes capture the subtle interplay between the explicit information obtained via message chains, and the indirectly derived information gained by the passage of time, given the time bounds. Centipedes are defined using two relations. One is called syncausality, a slight generalisation of the happened-before relation. The other is a novel bound guarantee relation among events, that is based on the bounds on message transmission. In a precise sense, centipedes play a role in the synchronous setting analogous to that played by message chains in asynchronous systems. Our study is based on a knowledge-based analysis of distributed coordination. Temporally linear coordination is reduced to nested knowledge (knowledge about knowledge). Obtaining nested knowledge of a spontaneous event is, in turn, shown to require the existence of an appropriate centipede.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0004-5411,1557-735X,,,,APR,2014,61,2,,,,,,,13,10.1145/2542181,,,,,,,WOS:000334671300005,,,,,

Thus it's appealing to study whether there exist interesting patterns about directionality in social networks and whether we can learn the directions for undirected networks based on these patterns. In this study, we engage in the investigation of directionality patterns on real-world directed social networks and summarize our findings using four consistency hypotheses. Based on these hypotheses, we propose ReDirect, an optimization framework which makes it possible to infer the hidden directions of undirected social ties based on the network topology only. This general framework can incorporate various predictive models under specific scenarios. Furthermore, we show how to improve ReDirect by introducing semi/self-supervision in the framework and how to construct the self-labeled training data using simple but effective heuristics. Experimental results show that even without external information, our approach can recover the directions of networks effectively. Moreover, we're quite surprising to find that ReDirect can benefit predictive tasks remarkably, with a case study of link prediction.

Since a trace does not convey information about the order of nodes within the path, there are many feasible orders for each trace observed, and thus the problem of inferring the network from traces is, in general, illposed. We propose and analyze an algorithm which inserts edges by ordering each trace into a path according to which pairs of nodes in the path co-occur most frequently in the observations. When all traces involve exactly 3 nodes, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the reconstruction algorithm to exactly recover the graph. Finally, for a family of random graphs, we present expressions for reconstruction error probabilities (false discoveries and missed detections).",,,,"Gripon, Vincent/X-6371-2019","Gripon, Vincent/0000-0002-4353-4542",,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-4799-0446-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,2488,+,,,,,,,,,WOS:000348913402124,,,,,

In undirected networks, triangles are enriched in almost all datasets, suggesting the prevalence of transitivity in diverse networks. However, 4-node structures lacking transitivity - diamonds and stars - are also enriched in the majority of undirected networks. In directed networks, variations of feed-forward loops are over-represented in the networks of web document and political weblog hyperlinks as well as neuronal connections.

The discussion focuses on two sets of variables influencing member performance: the embeddedness of the network and the use of different media. Three dimensions of embeddedness are distinguished: (1) embeddedness in practice: the extent to which the knowledge shared in the network is integrated in members' (local) practices; (2) structural embeddedness: the extent to which network members are connected to each other and know who knows what; and (3) relational embeddedness: the extent to which the network is characterized by strong social ties. In terms of communication media, information and communication technology (ICT)-enabled and face-to-face interaction are distinguished. A survey study among 206 members of different NoPs reveals that all three forms of embeddedness are important antecedents of NoP member performance (explaining 43% of the variance in performance) and that these forms are interrelated. Furthermore, ICT use positively influences embeddedness in practice, whereas face-to-face communication contributes to the structural and relational embeddedness of an NoP. This contributes to knowledge management and ICT literature in general and NoP theory in particular.

In academia, successful researchers have been found more likely to be persistent in publishing, but little attention has been given to how persistence in maintaining collaborative relationships affects career success. This paper proposes a new bibliometric understanding of persistence that considers the prominent role of collaboration in contemporary science. Using this perspective, we analyze the relationship between persistent collaboration and publication quality along several dimensions: degree of transdisciplinarity, difference in coauthor's scientific age and their scientific impact, and research-team size. Contrary to traditional wisdom, our results show that persistent scientific collaboration does not always result in high-quality papers. We find that the most persistent transdisciplinary collaboration tends to output high-impact publications, and that those coauthors with diverse scientific impact or scientific ages benefit from persistent collaboration more than homogeneous compositions. We also find that researchers persistently working in large groups tend to publish lower-impactpapers. These results contradict the colloquial understanding of collaboration in academia and paint a more nuanced picture of how persistent scientific collaboration relates to success, a picture that can provide valuable insights to researchers, funding agencies, policy makers, and mentor-mentee program directors.

To ensure analytical tractability, existing analyses of epidemic spreading predominantly consider homogeneous contact rates between nodes. However, this assumption is generally not true in real scenarios. In this paper, we consider classes of contact/mobility models with heterogeneous contact rates. Through an asymptotic analysis, we prove that a first-order, mean value approximation for the basic epidemic spreading step becomes exact in the limiting case (large network size). We further derive simple closed form approximations, based on higher order statistics of the mobility heterogeneity, for the case of finite-size networks. To demonstrate the utility of our results, we use them to predict the delay of epidemic-based routing schemes and analyze scenarios with node selfishness. We validate the analytic results through extensive simulations on synthetic scenarios, as well as on real traces to demonstrate that our expressions can be useful also in scenarios with significantly more complex structure.

Innovative use of eWOM has significant benefits, especially for start-up firms. We focus on how users on the web communicate value related to online products. It is the premise of this paper that generating emotional value (E-value) in social media and networking sites (SMNS) is critical for the survival of new e-service ventures. Hence, by introducing a formal value theory as a coding scheme, we report a study on E-value in SMNS by analyzing how a Swedish start-up industrial design company attempted to build a global presence by creating followers on the web. The aim of the study was to investigate how the company's website design and communication can affect eWOM over time. This was done by capturing a series of ""emoticon and value expressions"" generated by community members from three different e-communication campaigns (2011-2012) with changing website content, hence giving different stimuli to viewers. Those members who expressed emotional value, often incorporating emoticons, displayed both shorter verbal expressions and reaction time. These value expressions, we suggest, are important aspects of eWOM and need to be actively taken into account. The study has implications for information management strategies through using eWOM.

In the dynamic process of an information cascade, users play different roles in spreading the information: some act as seeds to initiate the process, some limit the propagation and others are in-between. Understanding the roles of users is crucial in modeling the cascades. Previous research mainly focuses on modeling users behavior based upon the dynamic exchange of information with neighbors. We argue however that the structural patterns in the neighborhood of nodes may already contain enough information to infer users' roles, independently from the information flow in itself. To approach this possibility, we examine how network characteristics of users affect their actions in the cascade. We also advocate that temporal information is very important. With this in mind, we propose an unsupervised methodology based on ensemble clustering to classify users into their social roles in a network, using not only their current topological positions, but also considering their history over time. Our experiments on two social networks, Flickr and Digg, show that topological metrics indeed possess discriminatory power and that different structural patterns correspond to different parts in the process.

Furthermore, relationships in these networks vary in their level of strength. In this article, we introduce a novel extension of structural balance theory as a foundational theory of trust and distrust in networks. Our theory preserves the distinctions between trust and distrust as suggested in the literature, but also incorporates the notion of relationship strength that can be expressed as either discrete categorical values, as pairwise comparisons, or as metric distances. Our model is novel, has sound social and psychological basis, and captures the classical balance theory as a special case. We then propose a convergence model, describing how an imbalanced network evolves towards new balance, and formulate the convergence problem of a social network as a Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) optimization problem. Finally, we show how the convergence model can be used to predict edge signs in social networks and justify our theory through extensive experiments on real datasets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1559-1131,1559-114X,,,,JUN,2014,8,3,,,,,,,13,10.1145/2628438,,,,,,,WOS:000339623400001,,,,,

However, because users of these forums tend not to have formal medical training, they often cannot verify objectively the soundness of the advice provided. Thus, there is a need to understand better the mechanism through which people trust and utilise information found on these forums. In testing a theory-based trust model, we find that forum users accept advice more readily as they develop cognitive trust (trust based on a cognitive assessment) and/or affective trust (trust based on an emotional connection). Affective trust is also closely related to formation of relational closeness. This indicates that, while both forms of trust are important, the development of emotional connections provides for long-term OHCs interactions. Findings here, indicate that prior exchanges are not needed to accessand utiliseOHC community resources.However, trust (developed through prior exchanges) is required for a recipient toleverage the contributor's social capital for information adoption and relational closeness. These findings allow the distribution of social capital to be viewed in terms of an asymmetrical model where it is possible to accept capital, in the form of advice, without first demonstrating trustworthiness.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework explaining consumer engagement with electronic word of mouth (eWOM) communication via SNS, based on key attributes of this media channel. Design/methodology/approach Based on the expectancy value theory (EVT), a conceptual framework is proposed to model the effect of eWOM channel attributes on eWOM engagement process. Consumer eWOM engagement is conceptualized as a second-order construct. A structural equation modeling procedure was employed to empirically test the model using data collected from two social media communication channels. Findings First, results suggest that engagement with eWOM can be conceptualized as a second-order construct based on user tendency to receive or share eWOM with other network members. Second, the path analysis model supports the employment of EVT and shows that two key attributes of eWOM channels, social capital and credibility, significantly affect consumer attitude toward eWOM via SNS. Attitude toward eWOM, in turn, affects eWOM engagement. Third, SNS channel type moderates the effect on attitude. Practical implications Marketing communication practitioners should note that the strength of social ties plays a key role in spreading eWOM on SNS effectively. This insight should be employed a part of social media marketing strategy.

In this context, mobile Opportunistic Networks (OppNets) are one of the key paradigms to efficiently support, in a self-organising and decentralised manner, the growth of data generated by localised interactions between users mobile devices, and between them and nearby smart devices such as IoT nodes. In OppNets scenarios, the spontaneous collaboration among mobile devices is exploited to disseminate data towards interested users. However, the limited resources and knowledge available at each node, and the vast amount of data available in the network, make it difficult to devise efficient schemes to accomplish this task. Recent solutions propose to equip each device with data filtering methods derived from human information processing schemes, known as Cognitive Heuristics. They are very effective methods used by human brains to quickly drop useless information and keep only the most relevant information. Although cognitive-based OppNet solutions proved to be efficient (with limited overheads), they can become less effective when facing dynamic scenarios or situations where nodes cannot fully collaborate with each other, as we show in this paper. One of the reasons is that the solutions proposed so far do not take into account the social structure of the environment where the nodes are moving in. In order to be more effective, the selection of information performed by each node should take into consideration not only the relevance of content for the local device, but also for other devices will encounter in the future due to mobility. To this end, in this paper we propose a social-based data dissemination scheme, based on a cognitive heuristic, known as the Social Circle Heuristic. This heuristic is an evaluation method that exploits the structure of the social environment to make inferences about the relevance of discovered information. We show how the Social Circle Heuristic, coupled with a cognitive-based community detection scheme, can be exploited to design an effective data dissemination algorithm for OppNets. We provide a detailed analysis of the performance of the proposed solution via simulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We integrate ultimatum game theory, which focuses on fairness, with motivation theories to investigate the effects of social distance and monetary incentives on the performance of three competing designs for online referral systems: rewarding only or primarily the proposer, rewarding only or primarily the responder, and dividing the reward equally or fairly between the proposer and responder. A set of controlled laboratory and randomized field experiments were conducted to test how the fairness of the split of the reward (equal/fair versus unequal/unfair split of the referral bonus) and social distance (small versus large) between the proposer and the responder jointly affect the performance of online referral systems (the proposer sending an offer and the responder accepting the offer). For a large social distance (acquaintances or weak tie relationships), equally splitting the referral bonus results in the best performance. However, for a small social distance (friends or strong tie relationships), an equal split of the referral reward does not improve referral performance, which suggests that under a small social distance, monetary incentives may not work effectively. Face validity and external validity (generalizability) are ensured using two distinct measures of social distance across several contexts.

Diffusion of the creative articles can make many bloggers or readers visit blog platforms. Restated, diffusion of the creative articles can assist blog service providers (BSPs) to retain bloggers and attract new bloggers. Thus, the research is conducted on creative article diffusion on blogs based on innovation diffusion theory and social network theory. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, an information system was used to collect 250 creative articles and social network data of these creative articles. Validity of the specific study hypotheses is tested by using multi-regression analysis. Findings - Analytical results indicate both observability and network density positively affect creative article diffusion, and ties-strength negatively affects creative article diffusion. Research limitations/implications - Since the interpersonal interactive mechanism of blogs differs from that of social network websites, bloggers establish different social networks which may influence innovation diffusion. However, different websites may have different interpersonal interactive mechanisms. Therefore, the results of this study should not be over-generalized. Practical implications - For diffusing information, BSPs may focus on blog articles with trackback rate below 10 percent among the friends-bloggers network and advertise these articles to make their trackback rate increase to 10-20 percent to reach the self-sustaining status. This strategy ensures the largest payoff from creative article diffusion.

Furthermore, the problem has applications in computational social science, viral marketing, and people recommendation.

Our work is motivated by a recent approach [27], which leverages the strong triadic closure (STC) principle, a hypothesis rooted in social psychology [13]. To guide our inference process, in addition to the network structure, we also consider as input a collection of tight communities. Those are sets of vertices that we expect to be connected via strong ties. Such communities appear in different situations, e.g., when being part of a community implies a strong connection to one of the existing members. We consider two related problem formalizations that reflect the assumptions of our setting: small number of STC violations and strong-tie connectivity in the input communities. We show that both problem formulations are NP-hard. We also show that one problem formulation is hard to approximate, while for the second we develop an algorithm with approximation guarantee.

These datasets, often including online social data of the mobile users involved, are increasingly driving the research towards the analysis of user social behavior. Within these challenged infrastructureless networks where connectivity is highly intermittent and contact opportunities are exploited to allow communication, node mobility is basically driven by human sociality. As such, understanding node sociality is of paramount importance, especially for finding suitable relays in message forwarding. This paper presents a detailed analysis of a set of six different mobility traces for opportunistic network environments including nodes' Facebook friendships. Using a multi-layer social network approach and defining several similarity classes between layers, we analyze egocentric and sociocentric node behaviors on the two-layer social graph constructed on offline mobility and online social data. Results show that online and offline centralities are not significantly correlated on most datasets. Also online and offline community structures are different. On the contrary, most of the offline strong social ties correspond to online social ties and in some cases, online and offline brokerage roles show high similarity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We develop efficient and practical heuristics for these problems and carry out an experimental study of their performance on three well known social networks, namely epinions, wikipedia and slashdot.

Here, we introduce a time-variant approach to the degree centrality measure - time scale degree centrality (TSDC), which considers both presence and duration of links among actors within a network. We illustrate the difference between traditional and TSDC measure by applying these two approaches to explore the impact of degree attributes of a patient-physician network evolving during patient hospitalization periods on the hospital length of stay (LOS) both at a macro-and a micro-level. At a macro-level, both the traditional and time-scale approaches to degree centrality can explain the relationship between the degree attribute of the patient-physician network and LOS.

Such deviations can hinder senior managers from governing their IT organizations effectively because they do not know how work really gets done. This paper develops an explanation for why actual structures differ from planned structures. Understanding this phenomenon is indispensable for managers to govern the real organization, to uphold compliance with important standards (e.g., ITIL, COBIT), to decide whether the formal or the actual organization is more effective, and, finally, to identify management actions that support the optimal structure. To develop this understanding, we analyze the interaction structures at the interface between firms' business units and IT units in four rich cases, using data from 56 interviews and 47 questionnaires, and applying qualitative methods and social network analysis, which give us deep insights into planned and actual interaction among employees. We test two different explanations for deviations of actual from planned interaction structures and find that boundary-spanning theory provides the dominant explanation for such deviations: Inclined to span the business/IT boundary most effectively, the actors involved deviate from planned structures especially when other structures offer better boundary-spanning potential, which is influenced primarily by cross-domain knowledge. In addition, relationships also play an important role. On the positive side, relationships provide opportunities for such deviations, while on the negative side, a conflict-laden relationship might hinder deviations even if they were advantageous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0268-3962,1466-4437,,,,DEC,2013,28,4,,,SI,,333,353,,10.1057/jit.2013.23,,,,,,,WOS:000327910800006,,,,,

This paper proposes an improved model to calculate the probability of a user being depressed, which is based on both node and linkage features. The linkage features are measured in two aspects: tie strength and interaction content analysis. Moreover, the propagation rule of depression is considered for improving the prediction accuracy. Finally, our experiments on the data derived from Sina Micro-blog shows that the highest accuracy of the improved model is 95%, increasing by 15% compared to the classifier with node features considered only. In this paper, it is well proved that adding linkage features analysis performs much better than node features analysis only.

In the market, users can access a repository of knowledge for a single price (repository pricing) or knowledge items in the repository can be sold individually (knowledge pricing). However, users have been found to prefer repository pricing but not the knowledge in the repository. This irrationality can cause market failure because users derive a suboptimal level of utility from the knowledge repository, and vendors have contradictory pricing and knowledge strategies. We empirically examine a joint explanation from two competing theoretical perspectives that accounts for this inconsistency nicely: The mental accounting perspective endorses repository pricing because it entices users with the benefits of the whole repository, whereas the transaction decoupling perspective finds expression in individually priced knowledge because it prevents the discrete benefit of knowledge from becoming obscure. By integrating the two theoretical perspectives and considering price, knowledge, and user characteristics simultaneously, the results offer important implications for the market transfer of knowledge.

In these sites, users typically choose their information sources, which in turn determine what specific information they receive, how much information they receive and how quickly this information is shown to them. In this context, a natural question that arises is how efficient are social media users at selecting their information sources. In this work, we propose a computational framework to quantify users' efficiency at selecting information sources. Our framework is based on the assumption that the goal of users is to acquire a set of unique pieces of information. To quantify user's efficiency, we ask if the user could have acquired the same pieces of information from another set of sources more efficiently. We define three different notions of efficiency link, in-flow, and delay corresponding to the number of sources the user follows, the amount of (redundant) information she acquires and the delay with which she receives the information. Our definitions of efficiency are general and applicable to any social media system with an underlying information network, in which every user follows others to receive the information they produce. In our experiments, we measure the efficiency of Twitter users at acquiring different types of information. We find that Twitter users exhibit sub-optimal efficiency across the three notions of efficiency, although they tend to be more efficient at acquiring non popular pieces of information than they are at acquiring popular pieces of information. We then show that this lack of efficiency is a consequence of the triadic closure mechanism by which users typically discover and follow other users in social media. Thus, our study reveals a tradeoff between the efficiency and discoverability of information sources. Finally, we develop a heuristic algorithm that enables users to be significantly more efficient at acquiring the same unique pieces of information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-4503-3716-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,83,92,,10.1145/2835776.2835826,,,,,,,WOS:000382167400010,,,,,

We study the problem of recovering sparse link vectors with network topological constraints over weighted networks.

Moreover, we prove that the navigable small-world equilibrium tolerates collusions of any size and arbitrary deviations of a large random set of nodes, while non-navigable equilibria do not tolerate small group collusions or random perturbations.

In this paper, we exploit local paths, particularly paths with weight, for the link-prediction problem. We use PropFlow [16], which computes information flow between nodes based on local paths, to evaluate a relationship between two nodes. The higher the PropFlow, the higher the probability that the nodes will connect in the future. In this measure, link strength has a strong link to the measure's performance as it directs information flow.

Data were collected from 128 IT professionals from a range of jobs, organizations and industries. Results indicate that the strength of the ties an IT professional has in his or her organization is positively related to job satisfaction. The number of ties that an IT professional has outside the organization is also positively related to job performance.

Consequently, a shift towards a nomadic computing environment, capable of supporting workers anywhere and anytime, is commonly observed. While many of the issues associated with such environments are technological in nature, this paper focuses on the social aspect of the shift to a nomadic computing environment, and examines its impact of employees' ability to effectively collaborate with one another. Studying changes at the individual level, we argue that an increase in workers' social mobility, brought upon by the move to a nomadic computing environment, is likely to have a negative effect on their social capital. Social capital has been shown to positively impact collaboration in various settings, including the workplace. We further argue that the above negative effect is contingent upon the type of mobile technology used by nomadic workers.

Following a review of electronic vis a vis social networks, the paper foresees the latter as crucial in the construction and diffusion of new knowledge in an IS community. A main contribution of the paper is that it utilizes a variety of disciplinary perspectives in order better to understand and improve use of information in organizations. This approach is in line with the view that in the future transdisciplinary forms of knowledge production will make traditional, disciplinary-based knowledge domains largely obsolete (Gibbons, 1995) and that knowledge relevant to IS professionals will be no different in this respect. Given this, the future role of the IS professional is portrayed here as that of a key change agent in the development, diffusion, and implementation of new ideas. A primary activity is foreseen as being one of bringing together and synthesising information, ideas, and practices from a range of disciplines with the focus being on information leading to the development of knowledge leading to the development of knowledge and expertise within organizations, not systems per se.

In particular, we identify specific elements of member generated supply chain related content on social media such as: information sharing, collaboration, trust, and commitment to determine their association with supply chain performance. We find information sharing and collaboration to be positively associated with supply chain performance, and these findingsare consistent with previous reports in supply chain literature. In addition, ours is one of the first attempts to use sentiment analysis to analyze social media content in a supply chain context.

It will require a radical change of the Internet data-management paradigm, from the current platform-centric to a human-centric model. In this paper we present a new paradigm for Internet data management that we name Internet of People (IoP) because it embeds human behavior models in its algorithms. To this end, IoP algorithms exploit quantitative models of the humans' individual and social behavior, from sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics, physics. IoP is not a replacement of the current Internet networking infrastructure, but it exploits legacy Internet services as (reliable) primitives to achieve end-to-end connectivity on a global-scale. In this opinion paper, we first discuss the key features of the IoP paradigm along with the underlying research issues and challenges.

Current measures scrutinize either local or global connectivity of the nodes and have been found to be inadequate for social networks. Ignoring hierarchy and community structure, which are inherent in all human social networks, is the primary cause of this inadequacy. Positional hierarchy and embeddedness of an actor in the community are intuitively crucial determinants of his importance. The theory of social capital asserts that an actor's importance is derived from his position in network hierarchy as well as from the potential to mobilize resources through intra-community (bonding) and inter-community (bridging) ties. Inspired by this idea, we propose a novel centrality measure social centrality (SC) for actors in social networks. Our measure accounts for-(1) an individual's propensity to socialize, and (2) his connections within and outside the community. These two factors are suitably aggregated to produce social centrality score. Comparative analysis of SC measure with classical and recent centrality measures using large public networks shows that it consistently produces more realistic ranking of nodes. The inference is based on the available ground truth for each tested networks. Extensive analysis of rankings delivered by SC measure and mapping with known facts in well-studied networks justifies its effectiveness in diverse social networks.

Design/methodology/approach - The study draws on the conceptual analysis of 31 key investigations characterizing the nature of the above theories. Their potential is examined in light of an illustrative example of seeking information about job opportunities. Findings - SDT approaches motivation by examining the degree to which one can make volitional choices while meeting the needs of autonomy and competence. Information-seeking behaviour is most volitional when it is driven by intrinsic motivation, while such behaviours driven by extrinsic motivation and amotivation are less volitional. Modern EVTs approach the motivators for information seeking by examining the individual's beliefs related to intrinsic enjoyment, attainment value, utility value and relative cost of information seeking. Both theories provide useful alternatives to traditional concepts such as information need in the study of the motivators for information seeking. Research limitations/implications - As the study focusses on two cognitive psychological theories, the findings cannot be generalised to all represent all categories relevant to the characterisation of triggers and drivers of information seeking.

Evidence from one field study and four experiments shows that consumers with more holistic (vs. analytic) thinking styles make more conforming product modifications when receiving public rather than private peer input, and this greater conformity to peer input boosts (vs. diminishes) consumers' evaluation of customized products when they feel close (vs. distant) to input providers.

An empirical study applied to Social Networks,COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Most of existing network-based decision-support systems, such as recommender systems, require knowing users' social context and, thus, the strength of their interactions. However, previous studies related to the usage and estimation of tie strength either assume that this parameter is given or use a computational model of their own. The amount, variety and domain specific information required to apply these models makes the reproducing and reusing of existing results extremely costly or utterly impossible. In our research, we show empirically the relative importance of different social variables for the computation of the tie strength and propose a computational model independent of the Social Networks' domain. Our experiments are based on a dataset obtained from a survey that involved more than 100 participants and comprised more than 500 social ties.

Using data from a social media site, we study how the interplay between effort and network position affects social media users' access to diverse and novel information. Previous studies of the role of networks in information access were limited in their ability to measure the diversity of information. We address this problem by learning the topics of interest to social media users from the messages they share online with followers. We use the learned topics to measure the diversity of information users receive from the people they follow online. We confirm that users in structurally diverse network positions, which bridge otherwise disconnected regions of the follower network, tend to be exposed to more diverse and novel information. We also show that users who investmore effort in their activity on the site are not only located in more structurally diverse positions within the network than the less engaged users but also receive more novel and diverse information when in similar network positions.

Social relation has been conceptualized in terms of how organizational relationships with social entities facilitate and/or inhibit organizational learning. In particular, we examine how two different relational structures single vendor dominant model and multi-vendor dominant model are associated with two types of organizational learning, namely, exploitative and exploratory. Furthermore, we investigate how three critical dimensions structural (core vs. non-core functions), affective (partnership vs. transaction), and cognitive (business value vs. IT capability) in social relation affect the relationships between the two relational structures and the two types of organizational learning in the context of IT outsourcing. The proposed hypotheses were tested using 203 Korean client firms that have adopted the multi-vendor approach in IT outsourcing. Results reveal that the single vendor dominant model exerts a more significant effect on exploitative learning than exploratory learning. By contrast, the multi-vendor dominant model has a more significant effect on the latter than the former. Furthermore, out of the six moderating variables, four (core IT function, non-core IT function, partnership relationship, and transaction relationship) have significant influences on exploitative and exploratory, learning. We conclude with theoretical contributions in the area of social relation theory and IT outsourcing literature, and implications for practices on how clients can enhance engagement in exploitative and exploratory learning to reap the benefits of multi-vendor outsourcing.

In recent years, online games have become a part of everyday life because such games provide opportunities for users to play with or against others and consequently make friends or strengthen existing relationships. In addition, concern for the role of self-identity has grown in academic research. This is relevant because online gamers behave differently in accordance with their self-identity levels. However, previous studies have limitations because they have not explored the role of social interaction and the way in which this affects excessive online game usage. Further, few studies have concentrated on the role of online self-identity in the context of social interaction and excessive online game usage. Thus, research should explore systemically the social interaction factors and consider the impact of these factors on excessive online game usage. This study categorizes social interaction factors into escaping from loneliness, expanding online bridging social capital, and strengthening offline bonding social capital. It also tries to understand how these social interaction factors affect excessive online game usage. In addition, this study investigates whether differences in online self-identity play a role in moderating the relationship between social interaction factors and excessive online game usage. 179 surveys from undergraduate students of three universities located in the central region of Korea were employed for statistical analysis. The research result shows that there is statistically significant causal effect between social interaction factors and excessive online game usage and that the moderating effect of online self-identity is partially accepted.",,,,,"Kim, Mi-Hye/0000-0001-5859-5471",,,,,,,,,,,,1386-7857,1573-7543,,,,MAR,2017,20,1,,,SI,,569,582,,10.1007/s10586-017-0747-1,,,,,,,WOS:000397969100046,,,,,

Insights from the Case of How Online Social Networks Can Assist in Combatting the Obesity Epidemic,AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS,,,,,,,,,,,,"One of the serious concerns in healthcare in this 21st century is obesity. While the causes of obesity are multifaceted, social networks have been identified as one of the most important dimensions of people's social environment that may influence the adoption of many behaviours, including health-promoting behaviours. In this article, we examine the possibility of harnessing the appeal of online social networks to address the obesity epidemic currently plaguing society. Specifically, a design science research methodology is adopted to design, implement and test the Health 2.0 application called ""Calorie Cruncher"". The application is designed specifically to explore the influence of online social networks on individual's health-related behaviour. In this regard, pilot data collected based on qualitative interviews indicate that online social networks may influence health-related behaviours in several ways. Firstly, they can influence people's norms and value system that have an impact on their health-related behaviours. Secondly, social control and pressure of social connections may also shape health-related behaviours, and operate implicitly when people make food selection decisions. Thirdly, social relationships may provide emotional support. Our study has implications for research and practice. From a theoretical perspective, the article inductively identifies three factors that influence specific types of health outcomes in the context of obesity. From a practical perspective, the study underscores the benefits of adopting a design science methodology to design and implement a technology solution for a healthcare issue as well as the key role for online social media to assist with health and wellness management and maintenance.",,,,,"wickramasinghe, nilmini/0000-0002-1314-8843",,,,,,,,,,,,1449-8618,1326-2238,,,,,2017,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000396730300007,,,,,

In this article, we propose a novel network of news sources, who are influential persons who appear in news articles. We first collect a group of news articles associated with a particular subject (e.g., abortion). Then, we identify and extract all news sources from the group of the news articles. In the news source network, news sources are represented as nodes, and two nodes are connected to each other if the news sources that correspond to the nodes appear in the same news article. Given a news source network, the goal of our research is to determine the underlying principles of the network. Our experimental results indicate that news source networks are a scale-free network with a heavy-tailed distribution because of the burst property of news articles. In addition, degree and betweenness measures are useful to identify the influential persons of a particular topic. Unlike most existing social networks, news source networks tend to show an interesting pattern, which is the polarity of high and low scores in both closeness and clustering coefficient measures. Moreover, news source networks do not always seem to have a gigantic component.

Second, we propose a method that infers how the information diffuses through this network. Subsequently, using this method we rebuild possible information diffusion graphs, and make statistical observations of the disconnected properties, size distributions, and diffusion patterns in Douban. Based on our empirical analysis, we found that in most cases, information diffuses with multiple origins in Douban. We attribute this to the two different kinds of influence that lead to the diffusion: internal and external influence. Finally, based on the observations, we propose a novel SID model to formulate the diffusions in online social network environments. In the model, there are n iterations. On each iteration, each non-infected node can be infected, either externally with probability Pex, or internally with probability Pin from each of the nodes it follows that were already infected.

Under such formalization, information is spread from a source layer, while it is diffused in multiple other layers. In order to validate our proposal, experimentations are focused on Reddit and its content, by observing the diffusion of its posts and related content in ImgUr and YouTube.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-20370-6; 978-3-319-20369-0,,,,2015,9051,,,,,,14,26,,10.1007/978-3-319-20370-6_2,,,,,,,WOS:000363774800002,,,,,

These key elements form the basis for an assessment of current approaches to collaborative technology development in industry. Four case studies are presented exploring two different industry sectors - aerospace and renewables.

Sociologists have studied this question for many years. According to some famous sociologists, social links are driven by social intersections. Actors who affiliate with the shared intersections tend to become interpersonally linked and form a cluster. In the social network, an actor cluster could be a clique or a group of several smaller-sized cliques. Thus we can conclude that a social network is composed of superposed cliques of different sizes. However, sociologists did not verify the theory in large scale data due to lack of computing ability. Motivated by this challenge, incorporated with the theory, we utilize data mining technologies to study the evolution patterns of large scale social networks in real world. Then, we propose a novel Clique-superposition generative model, which generates undirected weighted networks.

The strength of the relationships among users is distributed nearly uniform on the scale of 0.0 to 1.0. Nearly 90% of the users possess '0' clustering coefficient, which refers to the least possibility to find communities in the network. In addition to the listed properties, this study found communities of users with high clustering coefficient despite many users with low clustering coefficient.

Ubiquitous proximity e-service highlights the collective effort focused on collecting the user group's power as the reference for ubiquitous trust decisions. Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides some theoretical utility support for ubiquitous proximity e-service. The ""homophily"" describes the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others. By highlighting the ""homophily"" of e-service participants, these isolated individuals can be treated as a group with proximity. The main value of ubiquitous proximity e-service utilizes the network effect from the collective effort of interpersonal social network. Findings - In order to leap the trust barrier for users to embrace these ubiquitous e-services, ubiquitous proximity e-service makes it possible for users to collaborate with their nearby user groups to establish a reliable and trustworthy interaction environment. The simulation outcomes for trust decision quality enhancement show a significant improvement in a variety of environment settings. Practical implications - A significant value of ubiquitous proximity e-service lies in the increased possibility of establishing innovative social network relationships. From the interpersonal perspective, unfamiliar strangers can make connections with individuals who are proximal and homoplastic to them. The strength of proximity gives people better chances to make interpersonal connections, including both weak ties and strong ties. By combining those interpersonal tie relationships, ubiquitous proximity e-service can easily cause information diffusion and effectively encourage collective wisdom.

This paper will first explain how came that we faced this question in the research department of our university, then tell the story of how we are answering it by means of a new kind of knowledge network called ""CoRe"" and finally reflect on lessons we are learning about weak ties cooperation. The Swiss Distance University of Applied Sciences is organized in a radically decentralized way combined with traditional hierarchical structures and functional divisions. This has led to an insufficient level of interactions between geographically distributed university members (academic staff, students) so that weak ties have become the norm. In research one major consequence was that research activities were too much isolated in the departments, human resources were dispersed and research knowledge did not flow enough. Projects were small and less recognised, know how got easily lost and research tools' development was too slow. How to meet the challenge of improving research performances under conditions of weak ties like these? Our approach consisted in a collaborative knowledge strategy: to create and cultivate CoRe, an intra-organizational knowledge network of researchers (academic staff, students) organized as a community of practice connecting its members around the common task of stewarding research knowledge. This paper provides first an overview of how we are designing, implementing and cultivating the CoRe knowledge network and then reflections on the new subject of weak ties cooperation as realized in CoRe. In the first part, after introducing the background of the CoRe project as well as our approach to knowledge cooperation we will present the development process and focus on the evolution of the network requirements by comparing the initial and a revised version. In both cases these requirements were collaboratively developed by the network members in two large events: a) the network launch, a future search event (June 2006) and b) the 1(st) Annual CoRe Conference (June 2007). Based on an analysis of the evolution between these two versions, in the second part our paper will provide reflections and key lessons learned about how to design and implement a collaborative knowledge strategy which is able to foster knowledge cooperation under conditions of weak ties.

In this paper, we propose a fog computing assisted trustworthy forwarding (FCTF) scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study that investigates the role of fog infrastructure nodes (FINs) in forwarding scheme design. FCTF first selects the contact probability and the service degree as the basic trustworthy metrics between node pairs, and combines high-performance optimization algorithms to design a dynamic detection model of overlapping trustworthy communities (DOTCs). Then, we construct logical joint edge community structures on the basis of the results of DOTC and the distribution of FINs at each timestamp. Finally, based on the logical joint edge community, we define the forwarding utilities for FINs and mobile devices, respectively, and design self-adaptive forwarding rules.

Therefore, we conducted a quantitative 7-day diary study of 162 adolescent Facebook users attending German schools, looking at the impact of their daily SNS activities on their SWB.

Integrating the emerging literature on social media and crowdfunding with the literature on social networks and public goods, we theorize that prosocially, public-oriented crowdfunding campaigns will benefit disproportionately from social media activity when advocates' social media networks exhibit greater levels of embeddedness. Drawing on a panel dataset that combines campaign fundraising activity associated with more than 1,000 campaigns on Kickstarter with campaign-related social media activity on Twitter, we construct network-level measures of embeddedness between and amongst individuals initiating the latter, in terms of transitivity and topological overlap. We demonstrate that Twitter activity drives a disproportionate increase in fundraising for prosocially oriented crowdfunding campaigns when posting users' networks exhibit greater embeddedness. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings, highlighting how our work extends prior research on the role of embeddedness in peer influence by demonstrating the joint roles of message features and network structure in the peer influence process. Our work suggests that when a transmitter's message is prosocial or cause-oriented, embeddedness will play a stronger role in determining influence. We also discuss the broader theoretical implications for the literatures on social media, crowdfunding, crowdsourcing, and private contributions to public goods.

People are used to seeking useful information from the relationships among social members to support their decisions on investment, partner seeking and marketing. Corporations are seeking opportunities to leverage them for ""word of mouth"" advertising based on the relations between the customers. When we collect and observe relationships between people, missing or redundant relations unavoidably occur since the time and cost restrictions in market or social investigation prevent us to discover all the relations. Moreover, since the social relations are changing constantly, current social relations may disappear, and new relations will be established. Many trade and social networks consist of multiple types of relations between the individuals. This paper presents an efficient method to detect the potential and future social relations between individuals in multi-relational social networks using link prediction. First, we calculate the belief of each individual by belief propagation on each type of relations. Based on the belief vectors, the similarities between various types of relations are computed to measure their mutual influence. Based on the similarities between various types of relations, we model link prediction as the problem of matrix completion by optimizing its max-norm constrained formulation. We propose a projected gradient descent optimization algorithm which is scalable to large size networks. Empirical results on real multi-relational social networks demonstrate that the predicting results of our algorithm have higher quality compared with other similar algorithms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-9236,1873-5797,,,,NOV,2018,115,,,,,,78,91,,10.1016/j.dss.2018.09.006,,,,,,,WOS:000451791400008,,,,,

Key issues in understanding social media and such services include how to generate more information traffic and how to increase information exposure. Unlike previous studies in the research stream studying patterns of information diffusion, we investigate the role of influential Twitter users, focusing on their positions in social networks, in redistributing contents generated by other users. To do this, we employ sociological theories in determining which characteristics of connecting users provide more influence. Specifically, a connecting user's position in networks observable to audience affects the user's influence in a way that connecting users with relatively high status and those embedded in a closely connected community exert the greatest impact on the network. Moreover, the value of a connecting user's network position can be contingent on the source user's status and network position: a high-status connecting user contributes more to information diffusion when tweets are generated by a low-status source user, and a connecting user who is embedded in a well-connected network contributes more to information diffusion when tweets are generated by a source user in a brokerage position. After exploring data on tweets about Apple products and services, we find evidence that support this set of theoretical claims. Such findings would also provide a useful guidance for practitioners to enhance information diffusion by effectively designing the sequence of content recipients based on their network positions.",,,,"Lee, Ji-Hwan/C-1664-2011","Lee, Dongwon/0000-0003-4826-1632",,,,,,,,,,,,0095-0033,,,,,FEB,2018,49,1,,,,,13,31,,,,,,,,,WOS:000424262200003,,,,,

Related to triadic closure, the number of triangles has been extensively studied since it can be effectively used as a metric to analyze the structure and function of a network. In this paper, from a different viewpoint, we study triangle-free dense structures which have received little attention. We focus on K-3,K-3 where there are two subsets of three vertices, a vertex in a subset has an edge connected to every vertex in another subset while it does not have an edge to any other vertex in the same subset. Such K-n,K-n in general implies a philosophy contradiction: (a) Any two individuals are friends if they have no common friends, and (b) Any two individuals are not friends if they have common friends. However, we find such induced K-3,K-3 does exist frequently, and they do not disappear over time over a real academic collaboration network. In addition, in the real datasets tested, nearly all edges appearing in K-3,K-3 appear in some triangles. We analyze the expected numbers of induced K-3,K-3 and triangles (Delta) in four representative random graph models, namely, Erdos-Renyi random graph model, Watts-Strogatz small-world model, Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment model, and configuration model, and give an algorithm to enumerate all distinct K-3,K-3 in an undirected social network.

However, although most firms have an online presence on multiple social media platforms, the question remains as to whether marketers' widespread social media investments are beneficial for firms. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents competing hypotheses to explore how firms' investment in one form of social media impacts activity on another form of social media. To do so, the authors draw on a data set of 208 large Australian organizations using objective social media activity metrics that measure business-to-business (B2B) audience engagement. Findings - The findings suggest that widespread social media activity on LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube negatively affects a firm's marketing activity on Facebook. The results indicate that having a social media preference whereby firms focus on a specific social media platform is more effective in forming successful inter-organizational relationships than a multiplatform approach. Originality/value - The study contributes to the sparse research that seeks to leverage social media for audience engagement beyond a business-to-consumer context.

However, when building community structures, most traditional global detection methods only focus on the encounter ratio between nodes and need to have holistic cognition for the whole network structure information. Thus, in IoT applications with large-scale or incomplete structures, there are deficiencies, such as lower security and higher time complexity. This paper proposes a detection scheme for dynamic trustworthiness overlapping community, called D2-TOC. This scheme first employs evidence- based data between node pairs, such as contact probability, recency, and service degree, to construct the trustworthiness relationships between devices and the network model of mobile IoT, which can provide the security guarantee for data interaction from the start. Second, the D2-TOC uses optimized random walks and seeds expansion methods to fulfill the initialization and evolution of overlapping communities, which avoids the high temporal and spatial complexity generated by global community detection.

LinkedIn, which concentrates on professional networking, is reported to generate great informational benefits to its users. The purpose of this paper is to explore product users' knowledge construction in solving technical problems on LinkedIn, which was chosen as a case example. Design/methodology/approach - Discussion threads with rich knowledge elements were selected from an interest group about solving technical problems with laptops. Adopting a qualitative content analysis method, selected threads were analysed with a prior analysis framework built in the context of traditional IT company sponsored peer user support forums. Findings - The analysis revealed that the iterative and progressive knowledge construction process and associated trial-and-error strategy used on LinkedIn are similar to those found in peer support forums. However, LinkedIn members are more engaged in knowledge construction episodes. Meanwhile, the sub-category proposing a new idea accounts for a larger portion of discussions reflecting the high-level of expertise. One-to-one direct interaction is quite salient. Therefore, LinkedIn can support knowledge construction in a more efficient way due to the character of its social capital, including trust, sense of belonging, norms of cooperation, visible identity, knowledge articulation skills, one-to-one direct interaction and suitable strength of ties.

Using log and content data from 655 ESM-based workgroups at a multinational enterprise, we contribute a deeper understanding of the distinct ways that ESM visibility-bounded or unbounded-is leveraged strategically to evoke diverse network structures, which in turn have implications for distinct boundary-spanning activities.

However, it is still not clear if the network really collapsed from the outside. We analyze the time evolution of the network structure more exactly to check whether that is true. It is shown that the collapse of the Friendster network actually started from the ""center'' of the core structure. Following this result, we attempt to explain its mechanism by a propagation model. We conclude that the time evolution of core structure can be explained by the two rules: (a) non-users who have many friends on Friendster are likely to register for Friendster, and (b) users who have many friends that have already left Friendster are also likely to leave. The users who have few friends on Friendster tend to leave soon and that may have also played a key role in the time evolution of the core structure.

On the basis of panel data, we delve into the interplay among homophily, structural diversities across various online social networking services (SNSs), and users' homing preferences in such social platforms. The data feature of the SNS consumption behaviors of 10,172 individual users are obtained over a period of 134 days. An agent-based simulation model is developed to further validate and generalize the empirical findings. The simulation and empirical results consistently indicate that propensity toward homophily differs significantly across platform types and users' channel adoption behaviors. Online homophily is more pronounced in closed, private social networks than in open, public social networks. Users of asymmetric and symmetric SNSs exhibit weak and strong homophily, respectively. Moreover, whereas users who adopt a single SNS channel tend toward homophily, those who subscribe to multiple SNSs confirm the idea that ""opposites attract."" These findings suggest that users of online SNS channels manifest complex human interactions typified by the combination of homophily, heterophily, and asymmetric social preference, although homophily is the most prominent disposition.

Our context of study is a community of educators using and sharing teaching resources such as lesson plans, presentation slides and animations. We consider whether the deduced relationships between members of the community of educators constitute weak ties. A deduced relationship exists when two educators access the same resource. If these deduced relationships do constitute weak ties, then other theorized network properties should also be manifest, namely homophily and triadic closures. Our findings support these theoretical conjectures. Firstly, results indicate that the strength of a tie is directly proportional to the level of similarity between users in the network in terms of their propensity to use and share resources and their level of comfort with and use of technology (homophily property).

Thus, we developed a computational model to predict the formation of weak ties via triadic closures with an accuracy of 97.8 %.

These, often geo-tagged, data can be used to provide valuable information to closely located users, both in real time and in aggregated form. However, despite the fact that users publish geo-tagged information, only a small number implicitly reports their base location in their Online Social Network profile. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective methodology for identifying a user's Key locations, namely her Home and Work places. We evaluate our methodology with Twitter datasets collected from the country of Netherlands, city of London and Los Angeles county. Furthermore, we combine Twitter and LinkedIn information to construct a Work location dataset and evaluate our methodology. Results show that our proposed methodology not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods by at least 30 % in terms of accuracy, but also cuts the detection radius at least at half the distance from other methods. To illustrate the applicability of our methodology and motivate further research in location-based social network analysis, we provide an initial evaluation of three such approaches, namely (1) Twitter user mobility patterns, (2) Ego network formulation, and (3) Key location tweet sentiment analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1869-5450,1869-5469,,,,DEC,2016,6,1,,,,,,,,10.1007/s13278-016-0376-3,,,,,,,WOS:000382364400009,,,,,

We split each network into two, respectively comprising of strong and weak ties. To facilitate this splitting, we measure the strength of the tie among a pair actors based on the reciprocity of their relationship and the number of their shared or mutual friends. We hypothesize that the network composed of strong ties is expected to be rich in closure triads, whereas the network composed of weak ties is expected to be rich in brokerage triads. We test our hypotheses on four popular online social networks (OSNs), namely, Facebook, Twitter, Slashdot and YouTube. Empirical analysis reports that most networks composed of strong ties comprise both brokerage and closure triads, leading to the rejection of the first hypothesis. On the other hand, all networks composed of weak ties except for Slashdot comprise a significant number of only brokerage triads, leading to the acceptance of the second hypothesis. We discuss how the motives and mechanisms of interaction on each OSN contribute to its structure in the form of strong and weak ties, which results in the presence or absence of a particular form of social capital.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-5090-4054-4,,,,2016,,,,,,,9,16,,10.1109/OBD.2016.9,,,,,,,WOS:000387089700002,,,,,

Effects of homophily and triadic closure mechanisms are claimed to be important in terms of initiating new social interactions and in turn to shape the global social structure. This way they eventually provide some potential to predict the creation of social ties between disconnected people sharing common friends or common subjects of interest. In this paper we analyze a large Twitter data corpus and quantify similarities between people by considering the set of their common friends and the set of their commonly shared hashtags in order to predict mention links among them. We show that these similarity measures are correlated among connected people and that the combination of contextual and local structural features provides better predictions as compared to cases where they are considered separately. These results help us to better understand the evolution of egocentric and global social networks and provide advances in the design of better recommendation systems and resource allocation plans.,,,,"Karsai, Marton/M-6684-2015","Karsai, Marton/0000-0001-5752-556X",,,,,,,,,,,,2375-9232,,978-1-5090-5910-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,454,461,,10.1109/ICDMW.2016.90,,,,,,,WOS:000401906900063,,,,,

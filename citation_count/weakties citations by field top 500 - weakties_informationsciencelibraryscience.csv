The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in CiteSpace II, a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981-2004) and terrorism (1990-2003). Prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks were verified in collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work are discussed.

It is argued from the research literature and studies by the author that where ties are strong, communicators can influence each other to adapt and expand their use of media to support the exchanges important to their tie, but where ties are weak, communicators are dependent on common, organizationally established means of communication and protocols established by others. Due to this differential use of media, a new medium that adds means and opportunities for previously unconnected others to communicate will have positive effects on weak ties and weak-tie networks, in particular by laying an infrastructure of latent ties (ones that exist technically but have not yet been activated), and providing an opportunity for weak ties to develop and strengthen. A new medium may also have positive effects on strongly tied pairs where it adds another means of communicating and supports the communication needs and tasks of the pair. However, where a new medium replaces a former, common means of communication, the dependence of weak ties on a common medium makes weak-tie networks highly susceptible to dissolution. In contrast, strong-tie networks, with their connections via multiple relations and multiple media, can be expected to be more robust under conditions of change.",,,,,"Haythornthwaite, Caroline/0000-0002-7311-3140",,,,,,,,,,,,0197-2243,,,,,OCT-DEC,2002,18,5,,,,,385,401,,10.1080/01972240290108195,,,,,,,WOS:000179443900006,,,,,

The purpose of this exploratory study is to understand knowledge brokering from the perspective of IT professionals as they reflect upon their work practice. As knowledge brokers, IT professionals see themselves as facilitating the flow of knowledge about both IT and business practices across the boundaries that separate work units within organizations. A qualitative analysis of interviews conducted with 23 IT professionals and business users in a large manufacturing and distribution company is summarized in a conceptual framework showing the conditions, practices, and consequences of knowledge brokering by IT professionals. The framework suggests that brokering practices are conditioned by structural conditions, including decentralization and a federated IT management organization, and by technical conditions, specifically shared IT systems that serve as boundary objects. Brokering practices include gaining permission to cross organizational boundaries, surfacing and challenging assumptions made by IT users, translation and interpretation, and relinquishing ownership of knowledge.

It is a form of service convergence enabled by innovative technologies. Despite the alleged benefits of mobile banking, its acceptance has been short of industry expectations. One plausible explanation may be consumers' initial lack of trust in available services. The objective of our research is to reveal the mechanisms associated with the initial formation of people's trust in mobile banking and intention to use the service. For this, we attempt to understand the effect of four antecedent variables (structural assurances, relative benefits, personal propensity to trust and firm reputation) on shaping a person's initial trust in mobile banking and its usage intention. They represent four types of trust-inducing forces: institutional offering (structural assurances), cognition (perceived benefits), personality (personal propensity) and firm characteristics (firm reputation). We examine individual significance of the selected antecedents and also their comparative reliability in explaining the two exogenous variables. The technical basis of our empirical research is the innovative mobile banking solution that uses cellphones with a built-in smart chipset. The survey data are analyzed using structural equation modelling. The analysis showed that three variables (relative benefits, propensity to trust and structural assurances) had a significant effect on initial trust in mobile banking.

Researchers often rely on social network analysis (SNA) when attempting to understand these technologies, often without considering how the novel capabilities of social media platforms might affect the underlying theories of SNA, which were developed primarily through studies of offline social networks. This article outlines several key differences between traditional offline social networks and online social media networks by juxtaposing an established typology of social network research with a well-regarded definition of social media platforms that articulates four key features. The results show that at four major points of intersection, social media has considerable theoretical implications for SNA. In exploring these points of intersection, this study outlines a series of theoretically distinct research questions for SNA in social media contexts.

Some researchers believe social media provide a unique opportunity for brands to foster their relationships with customers, while others believe the contrary. Taking the perspective of the brand community building plus the brand trust and loyalty literatures, our goal is to show how brand communities based on social media influence elements of the customer centric model (i.e., the relationships among focal customer and brand, product, company, and other customers) and brand loyalty. A survey-based empirical study with 441 respondents was conducted. The results of structural equation modeling show that brand communities established on social media have positive effects on customer/product, customer/brand, customer/company and customer/other customers relationships, which in turn have positive effects on brand trust, and trust has positive effects on brand loyalty. We find that brand trust has a fully mediating role in converting the effects of enhanced relationships in brand community to brand loyalty.

The networked structure of interactions on YouTube and the tremendous variation in the success of videos posted online lends itself to an inquiry of the role of social influence. Using a unique data set of video information and user information collected from YouTube, we find that social interactions are influential not only in determining which videos become successful but also on the magnitude of that impact. We also find evidence for a number of mechanisms by which social influence is transmitted, such as (i) a preference for conformity and homophily and (ii) the role of social networks in guiding opinion formation and directing product search and discovery. Econometrically, the problem in identifying social influence is that individuals' choices depend in great part upon the choices of other individuals, referred to as the reflection problem. Another problem in identification is to distinguish between social contagion and user heterogeneity in the diffusion process. Our results are in sharp contrast to earlier models of diffusion, such as the Bass model, that do not distinguish between different social processes that are responsible for the process of diffusion. Our results are robust to potential self-selection according to user tastes, temporal heterogeneity and the reflection problem.

We use measures from social network analysis (SNA) (i.e., normalized degree centrality, normalized closeness centrality, normalized betweenness centrality, normalized eigenvector centrality, average ties strength, and efficiency) for examining the effect of social networks on the (citation-based) performance of scholars in a given discipline (i.e., information systems). Results from our statistical analysis using a Poisson regression model suggest that research performance of scholars (g-index) is positively correlated with four SNA measures except for the normalized betweenness centrality and the normalized closeness centrality measures. Furthermore, it reveals that only normalized degree centrality, efficiency, and average ties strength have a positive significant influence on the g-index (as a performance measure). The normalized eigenvector centrality has a negative significant influence on the g-index. Based on these results, we can imply that scholars, who are connected to many distinct scholars, have a better citation-based performance (g-index) than scholars with fewer connections. Additionally, scholars with large average ties strengths (i.e., repeated co-authorships) show a better research performance than those with low tie strengths (e.g., single co-authorships with many different scholars). The results related to efficiency show that scholars, who maintain a strong co-authorship relationship to only one co-author of a group of linked co-authors, perform better than those researchers with many relationships to the same group of linked co-authors. The negative effect of the normalized eigenvector suggests that scholars should work with many students instead of other well-performing scholars. Consequently, we can state that the professional social network of researchers can be used to predict the future performance of researchers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Four types of contextual factors are identified: physical environment, clinic activities, the nurse's situation, and the senior's situation. While each type of factor has particular implications for the participants' information behaviour, it is shown how the interaction of multiple factors led to the conceptualization of such notions as an information ground, which may be used for guiding further research on the flow of information in community settings. This concept of an information ground is further based on a social constructionist definition of human services information. The implications of the researcher's presence at the field site as an additional contextual factor are also discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

For pairs of members with spatial boundaries and no temporal boundaries (those in different cities with overlapping work hours), synchronous communication technologies such as the telephone, instant messaging (IM), and Web conferencing provide a means for real-time interaction. However, for pairs of members with spatial and temporal boundaries (those in different cities with nonoverlapping work hours), asynchronous communication technologies, such as e-mail, provide a way to interact intermittently. Using survey data from 675 project members (representing 5,674 pairs of members) across 108 projects in a multinational semiconductor firm, we develop and empirically test a relational model of coordination delay. In our model, the likelihood of delay for pairs of members is a function of the spatial and temporal boundaries that separate them, as well as the communication technologies they use to coordinate their work. As expected, greater use of synchronous web conferencing reduces coordination delay for pairs of members in different cities with overlapping work hours relative to pairs of members with nonoverlapping work hours. Unexpectedly, greater use of asynchronous e-mail does not reduce coordination delay for pairs of members in different cities with nonoverlapping work hours, but rather reduces coordination delay for those with overlapping work hours. We discuss the implications of our findings that temporal boundaries are more difficult to cross with communication technologies than spatial boundaries.",,,,"Wang, Charles/B-5565-2011","Wang, Charles/0000-0001-9331-8437; Pickering, Cynthia/0000-0001-8148-098X",,,,,,,,,,,,1047-7047,1526-5536,,,,SEP,2009,20,3,,,,,420,439,,10.1287/isre.1090.0239,,,,,,,WOS:000269983900006,,,,,

The survey showed that SNS provide an opportunity to reach individuals less interested in politics. Viewing a candidate's profile further strengthened existing attitudes.

Contrary to the notion that network positions are difficult to alter, I show that social media can induce a change in network structure, one from which individuals can derive economic benefits. In addition, I consider two intermediate mechanisms by which an informationrich network is theorized to improve work performance-information diversity and social communication-and quantify their effects on productivity and job security. Analysis shows that productivity, as measured by billable revenue, is more associated with information diversity than with social communication. However, the opposite is true for job security. Social communication is more correlated with reduced layoff risks than with information diversity.

Recent studies have shown that scientists can benefit from their position within collaborative networks by being able to receive more information of better quality in a timely fashion, and by presiding over communication between collaborators. Here we focus on the tendency of scientists to cluster into tightly knit communities, and discuss the implications of this tendency for scientific production. We begin by reviewing a new method for finding communities, and we then assess its benefits in terms of computation time and accuracy. While communities often serve as a taxonomic scheme to map knowledge domains, they also affect the way scientists engage in the creation of new knowledge. By drawing on the longstanding debate on the relative benefits of social cohesion and brokerage, we discuss the conditions that facilitate collaborations among scientists within or across communities. We show that highly cited scientific production occurs within communities, when scientists have cohesive collaborations with others from the same knowledge domain, and across communities, when scientists intermediate among otherwise disconnected collaborators from different knowledge domains. We also discuss the implications of communities for information diffusion, and show how traditional epidemiological approaches need to be refined to take knowledge heterogeneity into account and preserve the system's ability to promote creative processes of novel recombinations of ideas.

Business process re-engineering (BPR) is used as the example to illustrate the model. However, while BPR is used to illustrate our argument, the model that is developed is relevant to understanding the innovation processes surrounding any complex IT-based innovation. It is argued that the strength of this diffusion model is that it focuses not on the spread of particular technological artifacts (whether it is BPR or any other IT-based innovation), but on the spread of the ideas and knowledge underpinning the technology. In particular, the model draws attention to the ways in which technology suppliers commodify knowledge and present 'packaged' solutions. This creates problems for potential users who need to unpack this knowledge and integrate it with existing organizational knowledge.

An online survey questionnaire was distributed to top and recent answerers to investigate their demographics, areas of health expertise, and other characteristics related to answering behaviors online. Also, 10 motivation factors are proposed and tested in the survey: enjoyment, efficacy, learning, personal gain, altruism, community interest, social engagement, empathy, reputation, and reciprocity. Findings show that altruism is the most influential motivation, while personal gain is the least. Enjoyment and efficacy are more influential than other social motivations, such as reputation or reciprocity, although there are some variations across different groups of answerers. Motivational factors among top answerers or health experts are further analyzed. The findings of this study have practical implications for promoting health answerers to share knowledge and experiences in social contexts.

We conduct a meta-analysis of the domain based on a longitudinal review of SIS research over 33 years, and contrary to contemporaneous SIS literature which suggests that a paradigm shift may be necessary to address the increased turbulence, uncertainty and dynamism in the emerging competitive landscape, we find that the SIS research domain has the requisite adaptive capacity to evolve gracefully to address the challenges of the emerging networked competitive landscape. Drawing on complexity science and network theory we identify four priorities for the development of the domain for the future: conceptualisation of the SIS Domain as a CAS for the co-evolution of Physical and Social Technologies; the adoption of the network paradigm; access to a science of networks; and adoption of Complexity Science as an articulation device within SIS and across disciplines.

These metrics can offer a better understanding and measurability of this social media/social network/online communication management tool. Design/methodology/approach - Three theories (dialogic, stakeholders and legitimacy) were considered in the development of these metrics. Empirical evidence was collected from a sample of 314 European companies. Then ten active companies were used to validate the proposed metrics on Facebook. Findings - The constructed set of metrics was found to be valid and efficiently usable according to the principles of the applied theories. Moreover all the proposed metrics could be adapted for such sites as Google +. Research limitations/implications - Limitations can only be identified within the validation process as the metrics were only applied to ten representative companies from the Eurozone. Practical implications - The proposed metrics will help users, marketing/PR/communication professionals and company managers to measure their and their competitors' popularity, commitment, virality (metrics which reflect stakeholder engagement), and the mood of stakeholders, and use content analysis in order to measure social legitimacy via CSR information disclosure on Facebook. Thus the online reputation of a company can be practically measured.

Computer simulations of the diffusion of a new behavior within the social network of a Bangladesh village led to the discovery of a new principle of social change that resolves this paradox. The results revealed the important but overlooked role played by boundaries that emerge within a social network and how such local boundaries affect the creation of a new social norm. A minority position can become the social norm by means of the process of bounded normative influence. As long as a minority maintains its majority status within its own, locally bounded portion of the network, then it can survive, recruit converts in the near surround, and establish its behavior as the norm for the netwrok as a whole.

J,"Hilbert, M",,,,"Hilbert, Martin",,,The end justifies the definition: The manifold outlooks on the digital divide and their practical usefulness for policy-making,TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Based on the theory of the diffusion of innovations through social networks, the article discusses the main approaches researchers have taken to conceptualize the digital divide. The result is a common framework that addresses the questions of who (e.g. divide between individuals, countries, etc.), with which kinds of characteristics (e.g. income, geography, age, etc.), connects how (mere access or effective adoption), to what (e.g. phones, Internet, digital TV, etc.). Different constellations in these four variables lead to a combinatorial array of choices to define the digital divide. This vast collection of theoretically justifiable definitions is contrasted with the question of how the digital divide is defined in practice by policy makers. The cases of the United States, South Korea, and Chile are used to show that many diverse actors with dissimilar goals are involved in confronting the digital divide. Each of them takes a different outlook on the challenge. This leads to the question if this heterogeneity is harmful and if countries that count with a coherent national strategy and common outlook on digital development do better than others. It is shown that the effect of a coherent vision is secondary to tailor-made sector-specific efforts. On the contrary, a one-size-fits-all outlook on a multifaceted challenge might rather be harmful. This leads to the conclusion that it is neither theoretically feasible, nor empirically justifiable to aim for one single definition of the digital divide. The digital divide is best defined in terms of a desired impact. Since those are diverse, so are the definitions of the challenge. The best that can be done is to come up with a comprehensive theoretical framework that allows for the systematic classification of different definitions, such as the one presented in this article.

In Internet auctions, an important design option for sellers is the setting of a secret reserve price that has to be met by a buyer's bid for a successful purchase. Bidders have strong incentives to learn more about the secret reserve price in these auctions, thereby relying on their own network of friends or digital networks of users with similar interests and information needs. Information-sharing and flow in digital networks, both person-to-person and via communities, can change bidding behavior and thus can have important implications for buyers and sellers in secret reserve price auctions. This paper uses a multiparadigm approach to analyze the impact of information diffusion in social networks on bidding behavior in secret reserve price auctions. We first develop an analytical model for the effect of shared information on individual bidding behavior in a secret reserve price auction with a single buyer facing a single seller similar to eBay's Best Offer and some variants of NYOP. Next, we combine the implications from our analytical model with relational data that describe the individual's position in social networks. We empirically test the implications of our analytical model in a laboratory experiment, and examine the impact of information diffusion in social networks on bidding behavior in a field study with real purchases where we use a virtual world as proxy for the real world. We find that the amount and dispersion of information in the individualized context, and betweenness centrality in the social network context, have a significant impact on bidding behavior. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for buyers and sellers.",,,,"Spann, Martin/F-9636-2011","Spann, Martin/0000-0003-4645-3913",,,,,,,,,,,,1047-7047,,,,,SEP,2008,19,3,,,,,351,368,,10.1287/isre.1080.0190,,,,,,,WOS:000259723200007,,,,,

We theorize that the enactment of clan control is a dual process of (1) building the clan by developing its social capital dimensions (structural, cognitive, and relational ties) or reappropriating social capital from elsewhere and (2) leveraging the clan by reinforcing project-facilitating shared values, beliefs, and norms, and inhibiting those that impede the achievement of project goals. We explore how clan control was enacted in a large IT project at a major logistics organization in which clan control was quickly instituted to avoid an impending project failure. Our research contributes to theory in three ways: (1) we reconcile the two differing views of clan control into a single framework, (2) we explain the role of controllers in enacting clan control, and (3) we clarify, how formal control can be employed to develop clan control.",,,,"Chua, Cecil/F-3332-2012","Chua, Cecil/0000-0001-9384-1535",,,,,,,,,,,,0276-7783,,,,,JUN,2012,36,2,,,,,577,600,,,,,,,,,WOS:000304296400012,,,,,

Words and co-words, however, obtain meaning in sentences, and sentences obtain meaning in their contexts of use. At the science/society interface, words can be expected to have different meanings: the codes of communication that provide meaning to words differ on the varying sides of the interface. Furthermore, meanings and interfaces may change over time. Given this structuring of meaning across interfaces and over time, we distinguish between metaphors and diaphors as reflexive mechanisms that facilitate the translation between contexts. Our empirical focus is on three recent scientific controversies: Monarch butterflies, Frankenfoods, and stem-cell therapies.

This paper builds on a belief that for the field to move forward and have an impact on practitioners and other academic fields, the existing work must be examined and systematized. It is particularly important to systematize research on the factors that underlie success of organizational IS. The goal here is to conceptualize the IS success antecedents (ISSA) area of research through surveying, synthesizing, and explicating the work in the domain. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, a taxonomy of 12 general categories is created, and existing research within each category is examined. Important lacunae in the direction of work have been determined. It is found that little work has been conducted on the macro-level independent variables, the most difficult variables to assess, although these variables may be the most important to understanding the ultimate value of IS to organizations. Similarly, ISSA research on success variables of consequence to organizations was found severely lacking. Variable analysis research on organizational-level success variables was found to be literally nonexistent in the IS field, whereas research in the organizational studies field was found to provide useful directions for IS researchers. The specifics of the 12 taxonomy areas are analyzed and directions for research in each of them provided. Thus, researchers and practitioners are directed toward available research and receive suggestions for future work to bring ISSA research toward an organized and cohesive future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0742-1222,,,,,FAL,2003,20,2,,,,,169,246,,10.1080/07421222.2003.11045768,,,,,,,WOS:000185857100008,,,,,

There have been no studies of how they manage personal health information on social media. Objective To understand how chronically ill teenage patients manage their privacy on social media sites. Design A qualitative study based on a content analysis of semistructured interviews with 20 hospital patients (12-18 years). Results Most teenage patients do not disclose their personal health information on social media, even though the study found a pervasive use of Facebook. Facebook is a place to be a ""regular"", rather than a sick teenager. It is a place where teenage patients stay up-to-date about their social life-it is not seen as a place to discuss their diagnosis and treatment. The majority of teenage patients don't use social media to come into contact with others with similar conditions and they don't use the internet to find health information about their diagnosis. Conclusions Social media play an important role in the social life of teenage patients. They enable young patients to be ""regular"" teenagers.

Moreover, the number of kin in a Facebook network was a crucial component because it predicted online tension whereas number of work and social contacts did not.

We argue that this conceptualization does not adequately represent most organizations today, in which multiple users interact with multiple information systems within a group. Relying heavily on the theory and methods behind social network analysis, we introduce the concept of multimodal networks to assess both users and information systems as equivalent nodes in a single social network. This perspective allows us to examine the influence of information systems on organizational outcomes as a function of all of the user-system and interpersonal interactions in a group. We explore two different possible mechanisms for this influence: (1) direct user-system interactions by aggregating the strength of all the dyadic user-system interactions in a group, and (2) indirect user-system interactions by assessing the centrality of the information systems within the social network. We survey approximately 600 individuals in 40 healthcare groups to test whether either or both of these mechanisms are associated with two types of organizational performance outcomes-efficiency and quality of care. We find that the centrality of the information systems within the network is significantly and positively associated with both efficiency and quality outcomes, but that the average strength of the user-system interactions is not. Implications are that managers and researchers should examine the wider multimodal network of multiple users and multiple systems when assessing the role of IS in organizations in relation to organizational performance outcomes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1047-7047,,,,,SEP,2008,19,3,,,,,253,272,,10.1287/isre.1070.0158,,,,,,,WOS:000259723200002,,,,,

Such probabilities are central to fundamental issues in social network analysis, including the influence maximization problem. In practice, adoption probabilities have significant implications for applications ranging from social network-based target marketing to political campaigns, yet predicting adoption probabilities has not received sufficient research attention. Building on relevant social network theories, we identify and operationalize key factors that affect adoption decisions: social influence, structural equivalence, entity similarity, and confounding factors. We then develop the locally weighted expectation-maximization method for Naive Bayesian learning to predict adoption probabilities on the basis of these factors. The principal challenge addressed in this study is how to predict adoption probabilities in the presence of confounding factors that are generally unobserved. Using data from two large-scale social networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative research design was used. Data were collected from 41 in-depth interviews with Chinese and American employees who worked for a multinational Fortune 100 company Findings - The research discovered that three categories of factors were critical in impacting Chinese and American participants' online knowledge sharing: organizational issues, national cultural differences, and online communities of practice (Co Ps). Organizational issues, including performance expectancy compatibility based on work practice, knowledge-sharing culture and time pressures, were identified as being important factors that strongly influenced both Chinese and Americans' knowledge sharing. Three major national culture-related differences emerged as significant: language, different thinking logic, and different levels of perceived credibility of voluntarily shared knowledge. These cultural differences made Chinese participants contribute knowledge less frequently than their US peers. Online Co Ps showed both advantages and disadvantages in facilitating knowledge sharing among globally distributed members, and these factors influenced both cultural groups in similar ways. Research limitations/implications - The findings were based on a single case study from one business sector Only US and Chinese participants were included in the study Originality/value - Research on knowledge sharing among geographically distributed and culturally diversified employees through online systems is still in its infancy The paper integrates research from multiple disciplines (organizational studies, national culture and online Co Ps) to address the literature gap.

Yet, it is not sufficient to say that knowledge exchange must take place; instead, we need to ask what kinds of exchanges form the basis of collaboration in these groups. To explore this, members of three distributed, interdisciplinary teams (one science and two social science teams) were asked what they learned from the five to eight others with whom they worked most closely, and what they thought those others learned from them. Results show the exchange of factual knowledge to be only one of a number of learning exchanges that support the team. Important exchanges also include learning the process of doing something, learning about methods, engaging jointly in research, learning about technology, generating new ideas, socialization into the profession, accessing a network of contacts, and administration work.

Although existing studies reveal that people with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) rely extensively on personal relationships for HIV/AIDS information, they explain little about how this happens as a social process. To investigate how PHAs and their friends/family members acquire and share network-mediated HIV/AIDS information, semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted in three rural regions of Canada. Interviews were carried outwith 114 PHAs, their friends/family members, and health care and service providers. A network solicitation and chain-referral recruitment procedure was used to delineate HIV/AIDS information networks for participants. Interview data were analyzed qualitatively and compared to Haythornthwaite's (1996) concepts of network-mediated information processes and Talja and Hansen's (2006) collaborative information behavior framework. Findings revealed that participants obtained HIV/AIDS information from their networks through five interactive processes: joint seeking, tag-team seeking, exposure, opportunity, and legitimation. The results of this study advance information behavior theory by pointing to the interactive character of information behavior and introducing new concepts to describe everyday life collaborative information behavior. This research also demonstrates the extensive interplay between health information exchange and the sharing of emotional support.

While this research has been prescriptive of contract terms that lead to successful outsourcing, there is need for clarity on what specific governance options are available at each moment of governance and how governance choices at one moment affect those at another, and consequently affect outsourcing outcomes. This paper draws on theoretical and empirical work in the areas of governance and contracts to develop a model of IS outsourcing governance, delineating specific moments of governance (MoG). It describes how the IS outsourcing context circumscribes market, hierarchy, and network governance options that are available at the promissory contract and psychological contract moments. Processes and structures that constitute governance choices at each moment of governance are identified. This analysis of outcomes recognizes an inherent tension in interorganizational relationships: firms' desire for value capture or efficiency vs their desire for value creation or innovation.

We focus on one specific type of success as measured by the rate of knowledge creation in an open source project. Specific hypotheses are developed and tested using a longitudinal panel of 2,378 projects hosted at Source Forge. We find that network social capital is not equally accessible to or appropriated by all projects. Our main results are as follows. First, projects with greater internal cohesion (that is, cohesion among the project members) are more successful. Second, external cohesion (that is, cohesion among the external contacts of a project) has an inverse U-shaped relationship with the project's success; moderate levels of external cohesion are best for a project's success rather than very low or very high levels. Third, the technological diversity of the external network of a project also has the greatest benefit when it is neither too low nor too high. Fourth, the number of direct and indirect external contacts positively affects a project's success such that the effect of the number of direct contacts is moderated by the number of indirect contacts.

On the basis of a case study informed by boundary theory and the theory of positive emotions, the research describes the SNS, its uses and how it impacted both the employees and the organization. We found that SNSs blur the boundary between work life and social life and that this boundary blurring creates positive emotions for the employees that use the system. These emotions create personal resources, which then have organizational impacts.

A relatively new technology, social bookmarking, is increasingly being used in many organizations (McAfee 2006), and may enhance employee innovativeness by providing a new, socially mediated channel for discovering information. Users of such systems create publicly viewable lists of bookmarks (each being a hyperlink to an information resource) and often assign searchable keywords (""tags"") to these bookmarks. We explore two different perspectives on how accessing others' bookmarks could enhance how innovative an individual is at work. First, we develop two hypotheses around the idea that quantity may be a proxy for diversity, following a well established literature that holds that the more information obtained and the larger the number of sources consulted, the higher the likelihood an individual will come across novel ideas. Next, we offer two hypotheses adapted from social network research that argue that the shape of the network of connections that is created when individuals access each others' bookmarks can reflect information novelty, and that individuals whose networks bridge more structural holes and have greater effective reach are likely to be more innovative. An analysis of bookmarking system use in a global professional services firm provides strong support for the social diversity of information sources as a predictor of employee innovativeness, but no support that the number of bookmarks accessed matters.

This study adopts a technology use lens to study the effect of three categories of social media use social, hedonic, and cognitive on job performance, as mediated by three dimensions of social capital. The research was conducted via a large-scale survey within a multinational Information Technology company. Social and cognitive uses of technology were empirically shown to have a positive, albeit indirect, effect on employees' routine and innovative job performance.

In this study, we focus on two antecedents of competitive behavior of firms: (1) access to network resources and (2) use of information technology (IT). We argue that while network structure provides firms with the opportunity to tap into external resources, the extent to which they are actually exploited depends on firms' IT-enabled capability. We develop a theoretical model that examines the relationships between IT-enabled capability, network structure, and competitive action. We test the model using secondary data, about 12 major automakers over 16 years from 1988 to 2003. We find that network structure rich in structural holes has a positive direct effect on firms' ability to introduce a greater number and a wider range of competitive actions. However, the effect of dense network structure is contingent on firms' IT-enabled capability. Firms benefit from dense network structure only when they develop a strong IT-enabled capability.

We argue that advances in digital technologies (1) increase innovation network connectivity by reducing communication costs and increasing its reach and scope and (2) increase the speed and scope of digital convergence, which increases network knowledge heterogeneity and need for integration. These developments, in turn, stretch existing innovation networks by redistributing control and increasing the demand for knowledge coordination across time and space presenting novel challenges for knowledge creation, assimilation and integration. Based on this foundation, we distinguish four types of emerging innovation networks supported by digitalization: (1) project innovation networks; (2) clan innovation networks; (3) federated innovation networks; and (4) anarchic innovation networks. Each network involves different cognitive and social translations - or ways of identifying, sharing and assimilating knowledge. We describe the role of five novel properties of digital infrastructures in supporting each type of innovation network: representational flexibility, semantic coherence, temporal and spatial traceability, knowledge brokering and linguistic calibration. We identify several implications for future innovation research.

As to social factors, the construct of small world focuses on normative constraints of information seeking and sharing. The construct of information grounds, in contrast, emphasizes the co-presence of other people as an opportunity to serendipitous seeking and sharing of information.

Within the latter view, knowledge is understood as a socially constructed and shared resource, and the focus is on the characteristics of the social relationships connecting the various actors and on the benefits these bring to the participants.

A variety of social network analytical methods were then applied. The results show that more top blogs have reciprocal links with politicians than have unidirectional links. The structure of hyperlink interconnectivity suggests that the ruling Uri party affiliated blogs are key in the blog network. For example, the blogs tied with the Uri party have a higher centrality and are more densely connected. Network diagrams also suggest that the top blogs are polarized by party. However, some blogs are located at the center of the Uri and GNP clusters and are connected to both camps. In other words, there are a number of citizen blogs that link to both the Uri and GNP members, because their political identities are not completely shaped but also remain between 2 different ideologies.

This exploratory study examines health information-seeking practices among Latin American newcomers to a small city in the United States. The framework locates these practices within social networks, the local institutional context and the use and non-use of information technologies. Method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in Spanish with seven immigrant workers. Interviews elicited incidents of both purposive seeking and accidental encountering of health information. Analysis. Data were coded for reference to social networks, strengths of social networks, and perceptions and uses of institutions, organizations, and technologies, treating the information incident as unit of analysis. Results. Information seeking is often assisted by both social networks and key institutions, yet the quality of the information transmitted through social networks is apt to be uneven, and newcomers are unable to obtain an adequate overview of local health care for improved decision-making. Of particular interest is the finding that the local information environment has evolved significantly in response to growing demand for Spanish-language and low-income services. Conclusion. It is particularly important for information behaviour researchers to examine the dynamic interactions among study populations and their information environments over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1368-1613,,,,,JAN,2005,10,2,,,,,,,224,,,,,,,,WOS:000226491900008,,,,,
J,"Wu, B; Shen, HY",,,,"Wu, Bo; Shen, Haiying",,,Analyzing and predicting news popularity on Twitter,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"Twitter is not only a social network, but also an increasingly important news media. In Twitter, retweeting is the most important information propagation mechanism, and supernodes (news medias) that have many followers are the most important information sources. Therefore, it is important to understand the news retweet propagation from supernodes and predict news popularity quickly at the very first few seconds upon publishing. Such understanding and prediction will benefit many applications such as social media management, advertisement and interaction optimization between news medias and followers. In this paper, we identify the characteristics of news propagation from supernodes from the trace data we crawled from Twitter. Based on the characteristics, we build a news popularity prediction model that can predict the final number of retweets of a news tweet very quickly. Through trace-driven experiments, we then validate our prediction model by comparing our predicted popularity and real popularity, and show its superior performance in comparison with the regression prediction model. From the study, we found that the average interaction frequency between the retweeters and the news source is correlated with news popularity. Also, the negative sentiment of news has some correlations with retweet popularity while the positive sentiment of news does not have such obvious correlation.

We construct a knowledge network based on coauthorship patterns extracted from four major journals in the IS field in order to analyze the distinctive characteristics of each subfield and to assess the amount of internal and external knowledge exchange that has taken place among IS researchers. This study also tests the role of different types of social capital that influence the academic impact of researchers. Our results indicate that the proportion of coauthored IS articles in the four journals has doubled over the past 25 years, from merely 40 percent in 1978 to over 80 percent in 2002. However, a significant variation exists in terms of the shape, density, and centralization of knowledge exchange networks across the four subfields of IS - namely, behavioral science, organizational science, computer science, and economic science. For example, the behavioral science subgroup, in terms of internal cohesion among researchers, tends to develop the most dense collaborative relationships, whereas the computer science subgroup is the most fragmented. Moreover, external collaboration across these subfields appears to be limited and severely unbalanced. Across the four subfields, on average, less than 20 percent of the research collaboration ties involved researchers from different subdisciplines. Finally, the regression analysis reveals that knowledge capital derived from a network rich in structural holes has a positive influence on an individual researcher's academic performance.",,,,"Oh, Wonseok/A-2343-2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,0742-1222,1557-928X,,,,WIN,2005,22,3,,,,,265,292,,10.2753/MIS0742-1222220309,,,,,,,WOS:000235522000010,,,,,

Although various aspects of collaboration networks have been examined, the impact of many network characteristics on knowledge creation and innovation production remains unclear due to the inconsistency of the conclusions from various research studies. One such network structure, called small world, has recently attracted much theoretical attention as it has been suggested that it can enhance the information transmission efficiency among the network actors. However, the existing empirical studies have failed to provide consistent results regarding the effect of small-world network properties on network performance in terms of its scientific and technological productivity. In this paper, using the data on 29 years of journal publications and patents in the field of biotechnology in Canada, the network of scientists' collaboration activities has been constructed based on their co-authorships in scientific articles. Various structural properties of this network have been measured and the relationships between the network structure and knowledge creation, and quantity and quality of technological performance have been examined.

A triangulated approach was employed in respect of the data collection, which included non-participatory observation, focus groups, documentary, analysis, and semi-structured interviews. A pattern analysis of data account was undertaken. Findings - Two models for intergenerational knowledge transfer are presented: the source-recipient model and the model of mutual exchange. This research also shows how a context conducive to knowledge transfer was developed, and concludes that this context allowed both explicit and tacit knowledge to be transferred. Research limitations/implications - Often ignored or underestimated this study highlights the need for motivation, inspiration, and empowerment in knowledge transfer The main limitation of this study is the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications - The two models for intergenerational knowledge transfer provide a rubric against which both old and new intergenerational knowledge transfer initiatives can be assessed to determine whether they are capable of encouraging the transfer of both explicit and tacit knowledge.

In this study, a trust model in C2C e-commerce was developed, which incorporates four perspectives, namely, (1) natural propensity to trust (NPT) as a personality perspective, (2) perception of website quality (PWSQ) as a website feature perspective, (3) other's trust of buyers/sellers (OTBS) as an interpersonal transaction perspective, and (4) third party recognition (TPR) as an institutional feature perspective. This study also investigated the role of gender and age toward trust in C2C e-commerce. The results show that PWSQ and TPR influenced trust in C2C e-commerce in general. However, as far as those who are 40's and older than 40's go, only OTBS might influence trust in C2C e-commerce. Therefore, we found that trust in C2C e-commerce can be moderated by age factor. Overall, the model helps to increase our understanding of trust in C2C e-commerce. In particular, a deep understanding of this can be very useful to determine those strategies and actions leading the Internet users to become real online purchasers. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This becomes particularly evident in virtual environments that support high levels of interaction with others and with artifacts embedded in an immersive context. By drawing on IS theories of technology acceptance and IS success, and on theories of social interaction from evolutionary psychology, activity theory, situated action, and distributed cognition, we test the construct of sociability and its antecedents in Second Life-a popular virtual environment.

One of the important properties of this network structure is referred to as social capital, which is the network of contacts and the associated values attached to these networks of contacts. This study provides empirical evidence of the influence of social capital and performance within the context of academic collaboration (coauthorship) and suggests that the collaborative process involves social capital embedded within relationships and network structures among direct coauthors. Association between scholars' social capital and their citation-based performance measures is examined. To overcome the limitations of traditional social network metrics for measuring the influence of scholars' social capital within coauthorship networks, the traditional social network metrics is extended by proposing two new measures, of which one is non-weighted (the power-diversity index) and the other (power-tie-diversity index) is weighted by the number of collaboration instances. The Spearman's correlation rank test is used to examine the association between scholars' social capital measures and their citation-based performance. Results suggest that research performance of authors is positively correlated with their social capital measures. The power-diversity index and powertie-diversity index serve as indicators of power and influence of an individual's ability to control communication and information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To address this research gap, this study combines a multilevel approach and an optimal network configuration view to investigate the multilevel effects of social capital on individuals' knowledge sharing in knowledge intensive work teams. This study makes a distinction between the social capital at the team-level and that of social capital at the individual level to examine their cross-level and direct effects on an individual's sharing of explicit and tacit knowledge. A survey involving 343 participants in 47 knowledge-intensive teams was conducted for testing the multilevel model. The results reveal that social capital at both levels jointly influences an individual's explicit and tacit knowledge sharing. Further, when individuals possess a moderate betweenness centrality and the whole team holds a moderate network density, team members' knowledge sharing can be maximized. These findings offer a more comprehensive and precise understanding of the multilevel impacts of social capital on team members' knowledge sharing behavior, thus contributing to the social capital theory, as well as knowledge management research and practices.

Previous research using only the network of researchers' joint publications shows that a researcher's distinct connections to other researchers, a researcher's number of repeated collaborative outputs, and a researchers' redundant connections to a group of researchers who are themselves well-connected has a positive impact on the researchers' performance, while a researcher's tendency to connect with other researchers who are themselves well-connected (i.e., eigenvector centrality) had a negative impact on the researchers' performance.

The popularity of researchers and the strength and diversity of their ties with other researchers had significant effects on their research performance. Furthermore, geographical proximity still mattered in intra-national collaborations. Malaysian institutions more often collaborated intra-institutionally or with foreign partners than with other institutions within Malaysia. The country's five research universities are among the top-most productive of all institutions in Malaysia.

This paper reports findings of an author co-citation analysis of the field of human behavioral ecology that expands Griffith's concept of the social system of scientific communication to fit a socioecological framework. Cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling techniques are used to characterize the research specialty at large and portray five respondents' individual resource maps. The techniques reveal co-citation relationships among authors whose work they had referenced in recent articles. Survey data on searching and handling behaviors for an aggregated sample of 180 cited references are correlated with core-periphery zones of the individual maps. Findings that types of socially mediated communication and distinctive information foraging behaviors correlate with different zones of a bibliographic microhabitat support an interpretation that active specialty members conform to foraging efficiency principles as predicted by prey-choice models from optimal foraging theory.,,,,"White, Howard D/A-7034-2009","Sandstrom, Pamela Effrein/0000-0002-1462-6931",,,,,,,,,,,,0138-9130,1588-2861,,,,JUL-AUG,2001,51,3,,,,,573,605,,10.1023/A:1019655305286,,,,,,,WOS:000170653400011,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach - In order to explore how LIS researchers define the concept of information sharing, and how the concept is connected with theory, empirical material and other supporting concepts, a literature review and a conceptual meta-analysis was carried out on 35 papers and one monograph. The analysis was based on Waismann's concept of open texture, Wittgenstein's notion of language games and the concept of meaning holism. Findings - Six theoretical frameworks were identified. These are not found to be incommensurable, but can be used as building blocks for an integrative framework. Ambiguous conceptualisations are frequent. Different conceptualisations tend to emphasize different aspects of information sharing activities: that which is shared; those who are sharing; and the location in which the sharing activities take place. The commonalities of the people involved in information sharing activities are often seen as a ground for the development of information sharing practices. Practical implications - The findings provide a guide for future research which intends to explore activities of information sharing.

Social-network-based communication is becoming a necessity for companies to stay competitive. However, using social networks to effectively promote electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) remains challenging. Managers in general are unfamiliar with the key factors that can encourage online social network members to engage in eWOM. This study used social capital and self-determination theories to identify three social capital factors and two individual factors on eWOM. A survey of 238 social network users was conducted to determine the relative influence of these five factors on eWOM among the users. The partial least square analysis results indicate that tie strength and innovativeness directly influence eWOM in virtual social networks. Trust, shared language, and voluntary self-disclosure do not exhibit a significant influence. Theoretical and practical implications of the five factors for promoting eWOM in social networks are drawn from these findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

First, adapted from traditional reward systems, the calculative-based mechanism (CBM) serves as the benchmark. Second, the relational-based mechanism (RBM) plays a complementary role. RBM is founded on social interaction and consists of two social network constructs: relational deposits (i.e. network and valued network centralities) and withdrawals (i.e. network and valued network densities). Design/methodology/approach - This study collected survey data in collaboration with a health-care organization. The data collected from 180 respondents were tested against the research model using a partial least squares analysis. Findings - This study found the CBM to be beneficial for knowledge sharing. The findings support the RBM prediction of a positive relationship between the deposit construct and knowledge sharing, but fail to support the RBM prediction on the withdrawal construct. The RBM explained about 15 per cent more of the variance than the CBM. In addition, the withdrawal construct of the RBM predicts respondents' beliefs in reciprocal obligation. Research limitations/implications - RBM does not as strongly associate with economic benefits as the CBM, but it still plays a noteworthy role in increasing the possibility of an individual knowledge sharing. Originality/value - The study is the first to propose the concepts of relational deposits and withdrawals. The authors use a roster-based sociometric approach to collect the social network data and to benchmark the effect of RBM with that of CBM on individual knowledge sharing and his/her beliefs in reciprocal obligation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1367-3270,1758-7484,,,,,2015,19,2,,,,,212,235,,10.1108/JKM-05-2014-0209,,,,,,,WOS:000354649300004,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology is based on the longitudinal study (from 2000 to 2007) of three UK universities (University of Cambridge, London's Global University and Imperial College London), located in the area of London and selected on the basis of their knowledge mobility In particular, to evaluate the knowledge mobility for each university the paper considers the collaborative R&D relationships established by each university, in terms of joint-patents registered at the European Patent Office (EPO). Findings - The analysis has revealed that the universities' knowledge mobility is positively affected by both the explorative learning behavior and the establishment of strong inter-organizational ties. Moreover, results have shown that an increase of the explorative speed can entail a less positive effect of the exploration on the universities' knowledge mobility, since they can become less able to consolidate and implement the acquired new knowledge. Research limitations/implications - On the basis of these results, the present research provides interesting implications. In fact, recognizing the importance of explorative learning mechanisms, universities should enlarge and diversify their competencies and technological bases in order to be more effective knowledge sources and gatekeepers. Nevertheless, this shift towards new technologies and scientific fields should occur gradually for instance towards more similar and contiguous technologies, so guaranteeing the necessary strengthening of skills and capabilities. Referring to the universities network structure, the research suggests the importance of strong inter-organizational ties as mechanisms that enable the transfer of knowledge. Hence, universities should promote the formation of stable and long-lasting alliances and collaborations for favouring the creation of a trustworthy environment where knowledge can be exchanged and innovations rise.

By comparing the behavior of the constructs with the behavior of the constructors, we are able to demonstrate the analytical distinction between a cognitive and a social approach in an empirical way. This will be illustrated using the case of integration and differentiation in Science and Technology Studies (STS), Elsewhere, using relations between documents, I showed how STS is characterized by strong differentiation tendencies. In this paper I address the question to what extent this differentiation is also reflected in the social structure of the STS field. Can STS scholars and STS research groups be classified in terms of the sub-fields? Or do researchers and institutes carry an integrative role in the STS field? Are the relations between the sub-fields of STS maintained by individual researchers or research institutes, and to what extent? The analysis in this paper reveals that this is generally not the case. Although we are able to distinguish analytically between the cognitive and social dimension of the development of the research field, we find similar patterns of differentiation an the social level too. At the same time, this differentiation differs in some respects from the cognitive differentiation pattern. Consequently, the social and the cognitive dimensions of the STS field are not independent as no serious STS scholar would argue - but also not identical, as radical constructivists claim, but are strongly interacting Further analysis may reveal the leading dynamics, that is answering the question whether the 'social' follows the 'cognitive', the other way around, or whether the dynamics has the pattern of 'co-evolution'.",,,,"van den Besselaar, Peter/A-8945-2011; van den Besselaar, Peter A A/E-5938-2013","van den Besselaar, Peter A A/0000-0002-8304-8565",,,,,,,,,,,,0138-9130,,,,,JUN,2001,51,2,,,,,441,460,,10.1023/A:1012714020453,,,,,,,WOS:000169631200007,,,,,

The exchange and combination of knowledge that these networks provide is widely recognized as an antecedent of knowledge creation. By reviewing the main contributions of literature that link social networks to knowledge creation and innovation, we intend to explore how different types of networks, as well as the different dimensions of their social capital, influence innovative performance. An exhaustive coverage of prior literature has been carried out in order to locate all the relevant previous work. The analysis shows up the complex relationship between social networks' diverse facets and their members' capacity to create knowledge. The strategies defined for knowledge searching can condition which is the most appropriate type of network. In turn, the type of network can determine the most suitable structural and relational embeddedness. Hence, the decision to participate in social networks requires taking into consideration the different environments of these networks and also the singular aspects they present.

Of the 170 respondents, 46 indicated wiki-based systems as their primary knowledge management system, while 124 indicated non-wiki-based systems as the primary system. The results indicate the set of factors influencing usage are different than the factors influencing infusion. Further, non-wiki-based versus newer wiki-based knowledge management systems have different sets of factors affecting usage and infusion. Both extensions to the base model have a greater impact on wiki-based systems as opposed to non-wiki-based systems.

Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical model was tested through a survey carried out on 152 MBA students of a university in east China, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed for data analysis. Findings - This research proved that both instrumental and expressive ties will facilitate trust and knowledge transfer. Cognition-based trust is not essential when low-tacit, general knowledge is transferred, and the effect of the expressive tie becomes negative when trust is controlled. When transferring general knowledge the instrumental tie is more efficient. However, contrary to the hypothesis, it is found that the effect of the expressive tie is not significantly larger than that of the instrumental tie during the tacit knowledge transfer process. Research limitations/implications - Besides tacitness, future research may consider involving more dimensions of knowledge into the theoretical model. Longitudinal and cross-national studies are also needed. Practical implications - The paper suggests that managers can enhance knowledge transfer among co-workers by enhancing their instrumental and expressive ties. However overuse of the expressive tie is risky The importance of trust construction in organizations is also underscored.

Design/methodology/approach - The research design is based on a case study methodology, In particular, two actual technology districts are analyzed, namely Castel Romano and Toulouse, in order to show how they use organizational, and cognitive proximity to acquire external knowledge sources and re-shape their geographical boundaries. Findings - Based on the findings of the empirical study, two main propositions are formulated. The first proposition refers to the negative relationship between the geographical distance to the district actors and the use of organizational proximity as a means for reaching external knowledge sources. By contrast, the second proposition indicates the positive relationship between the geographical distance to the districts actors and the use of cognitive proximity as a means for reaching external knowledge sources.

With this aim, actions should be devoted also to sustaining single local firms that are part of a technology cluster but not of a technology district.

From the organizational policies and practices towards competitiveness,JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose - The paper aims to investigate the standpoints and practices of university members from European developing countries regarding the harnessing of the intellectual capital (IC) within online academic social networks. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire-based survey with 210 university members was conducted, with the indicators adopting prior measurement scales which were further adapted to a network framework. Findings - The organizational policies and practices relate positively and highly significantly with the valuation of the network-based IC components. Moreover, 63 per cent of the professional and organizational competitiveness of higher education institutions is determined by the exploitation of the IC embedded in online academic networks. Research limitations/implications - All survey respondents were from the European developing countries, which may limit the general applicability of the findings. Also, the emphasis is laid solely on online academic networks. Practical implications - This paper brings to the fore both the potential and the state-of-the-art in leveraging the IC of online specialized networks which are indicative of the academic field. When acknowledged as such, the network-based IC is liable to generate substantial competitive advantages at the professional and organizational levels at the same time.

But despite data that confirm this trend, little is known about the reasons why researchers decide to publish their results in English rather than in their first language. The aim of this study is to determine the influence of researchers' scientific domain on their motivation to publish in English. The results are based on a large-scale survey of Spanish postdoctoral researchers at four different universities and one research centre, and reflect responses from 1717 researchers about their difficulties, motivations, attitudes and publication strategies. Researchers' publication experiences as corresponding authors of articles in English and in their first language are strongly related to their scientific domain. But surprisingly, Spanish researchers across all domains expressed a similar degree of motivation when they write research articles in English. They perceive a strong association between this language and the desire for their research to be recognized and rewarded. Our study also shows that the target scientific audience is a key factor in understanding the choice of publication language.

Yet, from aggregators to authenticators, the online landscape today is scattered with intermediaries such as EBay and Verisign, aiming to streamline e-commerce transactions and building consumer trust in EM. The central theme of this paper is to understand the contextual factors that lead to consumers' need to trust intermediaries. In developing our arguments, the paper synthesizes perspectives from information economics, transaction cost economics, and literature on institution-based trust to develop the EM-Trust Framework. Drawing from information economics, the paper contends that EM embody certain inefficiencies, which in turn contribute towards heightening consumer uncertainty, especially under conditions of high information specificity. Heightened consumer uncertainty subsequently reduces consumer trust in EM. It is only in the face of uncertainty and a loss of trust in EM that consumers transfer their need to trust in intermediaries. However, the transference of trust is complete only if agency costs from intermediation lie within consumer thresholds. A mini-case of online mortgage marketplaces is used to illustrate the EM-Trust Framework, thus creating threads for more insightful investigations in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-085X,,,,,FEB,2008,17,1,,,,,12,28,,10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000729,,,,,,,WOS:000253724000003,,,,,

In many applications, finding the most influential nodes in the network is informative for the network analyzers in order to track the spread of information, disease and rumors. The problem of finding the top k influential nodes of a directed graph G = (V, E) such that the influence spread of these nodes will be maximized has long been exposed and many algorithms have been proposed to deal with this problem. Despite the useful characteristics of community structure in social networks, only a few works have studied the role of communities in the spread of influence in social networks. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm (which has an acceptable response time even for large graphs) for finding the influential nodes in the graph under linear threshold model. We exploit the community structure of graph to find the influential communities, and then find the influence of each node as a combination of its local and global influences. We compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art methods for influence maximization problem and the results of our experiments on real world datasets show that our approach outperforms the other ones in the quality of outputted influential nodes while still has acceptable running time and memory usage for large graphs.

Interview data were recorded, transcribed, translated and coded following the principles of grounded theory. Results. Participants have been using the Internet to overcome geographical barriers and to integrate the virtual world into everyday life. Initial interactions in the online community promote the need for individuals to meet in the physical world with those who have similar interests and backgrounds. Interactions in the physical world in turn help weak tie relationships to develop into stronger ties. Conclusions.

Deriving from the relational communication perspective, informational and relational motivations are modeled as the two main antecedents of source preference and sourcing frequency in dyadic information seeking. Through a survey of employee dyads, our findings indicate that perceived information relevance is a significant antecedent of source preference for both task and social information seeking, whereas perceived relational benefit is significant in the context of task information. The results also show that perceived relational benefit has a stronger effect on source preference in task information seeking than in social information seeking. Furthermore, preference for a source is a significant antecedent of the frequency of sourcing in both contexts.

This model seeks to consider the roles of PHAs, their family members/friends and formal health systems in network formation. Design/methodology/approach - In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 114 PHAs, their friends/family members (FFs) and formal caregivers in three rural regions of Canada. A network solicitation procedure elicited PHAs' HIV/AIDS information/help networks. Interviews were analyzed qualitatively, and network data were analyzed statistically. Documents describing health systems in each region were also analyzed. Analyses used social capital theory, supplemented by stress/coping and stigma management theories. Findings - PHAs' HIV/AIDS-related information/help networks emphasized linking and bonding social capital with minimal bridging social capital. This paper presents a model that explains how and why such networks developed. The model shows that networks grew from the actions of PHAs, their FFs and health systems. PHAs experienced considerable stress, which led them to develop information/help networks to cope with HIV/AIDS both individually and collaboratively. Because of stigmatization, many PHAs disclosed their illness selectively, thus constraining the size and composition of their networks.

Yet despite its importance, little is known about the various types of crisis information networks and the role of IT in enabling these information networks. Employing concepts from information flow and social network theories, this paper contributes to crisis management research by developing four crisis response information network prototypes. These networks are based on two main dimensions: (1) information flow intensity and (2) network density. We describe how considerations of these two dimensions with supporting case evidence yield four prototypical crisis information response networks: Information Star, Information Pyramid, Information Forest, and Information Black-out.

We argue that this learning-in-a-network process differs from the classic observational learning model in a subtle yet important way: Rather than from anonymous others, the agents learn from their network friends, about whose tastes in experience goods the agents are better informed. The empirical analyses are conducted on a unique data set in which we observe both the explicit interpersonal relationships and their ensuing check-ins. The key result is that the proportion of checked-in friends is not positively associated with the likelihood of a new visit, rejecting the prediction of the conventional observational learning model. Drawing on the literature in sociology and computer science, we show that weighting the friends' check-ins by a parsimonious proximity measure can yield a more intuitive result than the plain proportion does. Repeated check-ins by friends are found to have a pronounced effect. Our empirical result calls for the revisiting of observational learning in a social network setting.

Findings - The literature review shows that knowledge types and knowledge transfer processes are the missing links in the relationship between structural SC and innovation. Moreover, the paper demonstrates that seemingly opposite configurations of SC are complementary to each other (structural holes vs dense networks; strong vs weak ties) and that contextual factors should be considered when discussing the effects of SC on knowledge transfer and innovation. In addition, it is the balance of different configurations of SC which enables an individual or a company to explore, access, assimilate and combine different knowledge types, which will lead to improved innovation outcomes.

Innovative ways of using datalarge and small-have also prompted a rethinking of the boundaries for the combination and use of knowledge. The strategic design of information flows in the economy has the upside of higher economic rents and competitive advantage, as well as the downsides of wealth inequality and abuse of power. This has brought a wide range of regulatory challenges. To understand the nature of these sweeping changes, it is important to examine the new ways information is used, and how information flows can be leveraged to create competitive advantage and dampen competition. The analysis in this article examines four economic entities that produce and consume value, as well as three determinants for the modes of their operations.

This methodology proposed in this study is based on network actors' similarities calculations by Vector-Space Model to calculate how possible network ties can be formed. Also, a threshold value of similarity for deciding whether or not a network tie should be generated is suggested in this study.

Our central contribution is a model that explicates the role of information systems in the process by which competitive actions or responses are conceived, enacted, and executed, and resulting impacts on firm performance-issues that have been largely missing from contemporary research in both the information systems and competitive dynamics domains. This study has important implications for both research and practice. Specifically, researchers should consider organizational context; the intentions and actions of key players; and the process of conceiving, enacting, and executing competitive actions or responses carried out by the organization to account for the impact of information systems on firm performance. Findings suggest that when managers envision information systems as a resource that provides opportunities for competitive actions rather than viewing information systems in a service role, competitive advantages will evolve. Furthermore, practitioners will be better able to leverage information systems investments if they recognize the embedded role of information systems within the competitive actions or responses a firm undertakes to maintain or improve relative performance.",,,,"Wang, Charles/B-5565-2011","Wang, Charles/0000-0001-9331-8437",,,,,,,,,,,,1047-7047,1526-5536,,,,SEP,2010,21,3,,,,,496,515,,10.1287/isre.1100.0301,,,,,,,WOS:000281924300005,,,,,

The investigation was undertaken through the adoption of a robust empirically based qualitative research methodology incorporating the role of technology as an enabler of KM application. Consequently, the study addressed the important question of translating theoretical benefits of KM into practical reality. The research formulates a set of theoretical propositions that are seen as key to the development of an effective knowledge-based infrastructure.

Working more intelligent is sharing knowledge to improve innovation and collective and individual competence growth. Understanding that investment in top technology solutions are inexpensive compared to the results delivered by professional human resources. Working greener means to let the team members be aware of green solutions and innovations. Working greener means to travel less using the possibilities given by social technology platforms.

Secondly, the knowledge diffusion intensity between N&N and nano-related subjects was investigated to determine the areas most closely related to N&N. Thirdly, the diffusion speed was identified to detect the time distance of knowledge diffusion between N&N and nano-related subjects. The analysis reveals that driving forces from the outside environment rather than within N&N itself make the foremost contributions to the development of N&N.

Knowledge transfer within N&N itself is the quickest.

It advances two questions. First, does social media increase the chances of protest participation at the individual level, as prior research shows for advanced democracies? Second, in a region with glaring economic and political inequalities, does social media deepen or reduce the gaps in protest participation that exist among men and women, the young and the old, different social classes, or people with varying levels of political engagement? Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses cross-sectional Latin American Public Opinion Project survey data from 2012 representing the adult population of 17 Latin American countries. It presents binary logistic regression models with protest participation as the dependent variable, social media use for political purposes as the main independent variable, control variables, and interactions. Findings - Using social media for political purposes significantly increases protest chances - it is the second strongest predictor. Additionally, social media reduces protest gaps associated with individuals' age, gender, psychological engagement with politics, and recruitment networks. Originality/value - First, the paper shows that the contribution of social media to collective protest travels beyond advanced democracies - it also holds for more unequal regions with weaker democratic trajectories like Latin America.

We address this gap by adopting a theoretical framework of the deep structure of organizational online networking with a focus on their emerging meaning for the employees. We apply and assess the framework in a qualitative case study of a large-scale implementation of a corporate social network site (SNS) in a global organization. We reveal organizational online networking as a multi-dimensional phenomenon with multiplex relationships that are unbalanced, primarily consist of weak ties and are subject to temporal change. Further, we identify discourse drivers and information retrievers as two mutually interdependent actor roles as an explanation for uneven levels of user contributions to the SNS.

Analysis: Scientific production involving intraregional collaboration in the Madrid region is analysed across three subject categories. The data used were taken from the Web of Science for the years 1995-2003. The main indicators of social networking obtained were: density average degree, normalized degree and degree centralization, betweenness centralization, closeness centralization and clustering coefficient. Results: Networking led to a moderate rise in the number of links and participating actors, with more Spanish companies and multi-national subsidiaries in the second period. The largest number of links was recorded for public universities located in the Community of Madrid. Conclusions: The data resulting from the social network analysis conducted provided insight into the structural characteristics of the networks generated and their evolution.

Relinking of families through marriage, for example, can be formally defined as sets of bounded groups that are the cohesive cores of kinship networks, with nodes at various distances from such cores. The structure of such cores yields an analytic decomposition of kinship networks and constituent group and role relationships. The Pgraph and Pajek programs for large network analysis help both to represent kinship networks and their patterns and to solve problems of analysis.",,,,"Mrvar, Andrej/A-3669-2009; Mohammed, Zainab/X-1672-2019; Batagelj, Vladimir/B-9105-2008","Mrvar, Andrej/0000-0001-8557-4692; Batagelj, Vladimir/0000-0002-0240-9446; White, Douglas/0000-0002-0148-9392",,,,,,,,,,,,0894-4393,,,,,FAL,1999,17,3,,,,,245,274,,10.1177/089443939901700302,,,,,,,WOS:000081354800002,,,,,

Some studies find that uncorrupt public institutions have positive effects on trust and social capital. Additionally, a number of papers show that public libraries have a similar effect. The mechanisms that generate trust, however, remain largely unspecified. Therefore, research describing micro-level processes is needed to uncover the mechanisms creating trust. This article reports a study of change in social trust among first-generation Mexican immigrants who participated in English as a second language (ESL) classes, computer classes, and civics classes in six US public libraries. These students displayed little trust outside their family and friends; however, after participating in library programs, they became more trusting of the library, the librarians, their fellow students, and other library users. These effects can be considered a starting point for a spiral of increasing generalized trust among the students.",,,,"Banakh, Iryna Ya./C-8303-2019; Varheim, Andreas/E-6316-2014","Banakh, Iryna Ya./0000-0001-6828-1193; Varheim, Andreas/0000-0002-5936-6563",,,,,,,,,,,,0024-2519,1549-652X,,,,JUL,2014,84,3,,,,,258,277,,10.1086/676487,,,,,,,WOS:000337739100002,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach - A total of ten institutions were selected from the following cultural institution types - public libraries, academic libraries, museums, government, and international organisations - to represent a variety of digital libraries developed or sponsored by different types of organisations. The social media applications were examined with regard to the following aspects: types of social media, placement of social media, updating social media, types of interactions, and types of functions. Findings - This study presents the types of social media applications in the selected digital libraries and further characterises their placements, update frequency, types of interactions between digital librarians and users, as well as various types of roles they played. In the process of analysis the authors also identified problems related to lack of standards, creating two-way communication channels, and the lack of education functions. Research limitations/implications - Further research needs to expand the selection of institutions and digital libraries to have more representative sampling, in particular institutions that are outside North America and Europe. It is also important to perform in-depth content analysis of social media to identify patterns and functions that social media perform. Moreover the authors will compare specific social media tools, such as Twitter, Facebook, etc., across institutions. In order to explore fully the reason why certain social media tools are implemented in digital libraries, it is important to survey or interview digital librarians of digital libraries in different types of cultural institutions. In addition users can be interviewed to solicit their perspectives about their usage of social media in digital libraries. Originality/value - This study not only examines the current status and problems of social media application in digital libraries but also offers suggestions on making good use of social media to connect users and digital libraries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1468-4527,1468-4535,,,,,2014,38,4,,,,,502,523,,10.1108/OIR-11-2013-0261,,,,,,,WOS:000342001700004,,,,,

Little is known about the quality of health information in social contexts or how socio-emotional factors impact users' evaluations of quality. We explored how librarians, nurses and users assessed the quality of health answers posted on Yahoo! Answers, focusing on socio-emotional reactions displayed, advice given to users and relationships between socio-emotional support, advice and evaluation criteria. Method. Forty evaluators from each of three groups (librarians, nurses and Yahoo! Answers users) evaluated ten health answers using an online tool. Participants answered open-ended questions asking for overall impressions, suggestions and advice for users and any other comments. Analysis. Responses were analysed qualitatively using an inductive open coding approach. Emergent codes were developed for evaluation criteria, emotional reactions and advice themes. Results. Criteria matched with previous research, but greater consideration was given to style, sources and subjectivity by participants in this research. Users value social and emotional support and are accepting of the subjectivity of social questioning-and-answering Websites, but librarians and nurses are less accepting. Conclusion. Both objective and subjective strategies have a place in the seeking, sharing and evaluation of information from social questioning-and-answering sites.

In particular, we argue that there are decreasing returns to scale on the level of the individual research groups, which prevent them from becoming to large, while we argue for positive agglomeration effects on the supra-research-group-level inside the university. As a consequence an efficient university organization would precisely consist of tying together many small individual research groups without merging them. Basing our empirical analysis on a multilevel dataset for German research institutes from four disciplines we are able to find strong support for the presence of these effects. This suggests that the emergence of the dominant model of university organization may also be the result of these particular features of the production process, where the least we can say is that this model is under the given circumstances highly efficient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0138-9130,1588-2861,,,,FEB,2013,94,2,,,,,541,565,,10.1007/s11192-012-0834-2,,,,,,,WOS:000313711500006,,,,,

The development of strategic visions about public Wi-Fi services among user groups and local startups provided a fertile ground for diverse partnerships among nonprofit groups, broadband providers, wireless ISPs, and the city government. We also found that the popularity of the venue-sponsored or free-to-end-user model of access is supported by different providers that see their interests represented in the growth of public wireless broadband.

There was no link between bridging social capital, or one's more diverse ties, and trust. Facebook use was found to have an indirect but positive influence on trust through levels of bonding social capital. Civic engagement was also positively related to trust through the same measure of bonding social capital, allowing like-minded members of civic groups to connect, which spilled over to trust. Neither Facebook use nor civic engagement directly influenced generalized trust. This study suggests the viability of both physical (civic) and digital (Facebook) modes of reengaging trust in an ever-diversifying society. The ""virtuous circle,"" in which social trust and civic engagement prop one another up in a reciprocal fashion, instead looks like a figure eight here. Each measure indirectly boosted the other by first growing bonding social capital. When considered alongside divergent findings from Canada, this appears to be an American response to the increasing size of racial minority groups.

While from the outset e-business was assumed to be used by companies in order to increase efficiency and reduce costs, some previous IOS research and theoretical considerations suggest that both efficiency and environmental expectations can be important reasons for companies to implement e-business. On this backdrop, the paper analyzes the reasons for e-business technology adoption, focusing on the explanatory value of institutional factors like mimesis, coercion, and normative pressures. Theoretically based hypotheses are developed and tested using regression models with a quantitative data set of more than 1900 companies. The article tries to make an innovative contribution to the field of IOS research, first, by drawing on theories of organizational structuring - new institutionalism, social psychology, and transaction cost economics; second, variation of adoption rationales in different types of companies and different business functions inside a company is taken into account. It appears that the adoption of e-business is explained by external pressures from other customers, bandwagon effects and herding behavior during the e-business hype, and expectations and interests of professionals inside a company. In the 'core' areas of a firm, efficiency rationales play an important role, too. The data reveals that the reasons of e-business usage differ significantly by department and company type.

The Northern Territory along with Darwin, its capital, has a number of unusual characteristics including geographical isolation. A key component of the theoretical framework for the research focuses on social information, which has similarities to the more commonly termed everyday life information. The specific concern is with the kind of information that helps people connect to a community and is clearly linked with social networking. The sample for the major empirical component for the article was recruited at Darwin's Mindil Beach Market. In telephone phone interviews with those who had agreed to participate, participants discussed how they learned about Darwin and the Northern Territory, and their views of Darwin as a place to live. Interpersonal contacts, including at the Market and at special events, were most often mentioned in relation to information, confirming literature findings on the importance of family and friends as an information source. Other sources were newspapers and physical markers around the City of Darwin. The conclusion is that the processes of social networking, which work well for some residents, could be enhanced through the use of information grounds, a concept widely discussed in the library and information science literature. Obvious information grounds in Darwin, where the usual processes could be enhanced by the distribution of information by formal information providers, include Mindil Beach Market and the special events for which Darwin is renowned.

Design/methodology/approach - An embedded case study of Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) examining core drivers that impact on inter-unit knowledge transfers between six events and exhibitions (E&E) units located in Europe, Asia, and Australasia. Findings - The data highlight that effective knowledge transfer between E&E units depends on a combination of key drivers, such as social network ties, absorptive capacity, learning adaptiveness, and communication channels. The findings suggest that the search for and transfer of knowledge depends foremost on the applicability of context-specific knowledge rather than its complexity. Research limitations/implications - The focus is on one specific manufacturing sector and specific drivers to knowledge transfer in this sector, limiting the generalisation of the findings. Also, the findings were drawn from a limited sample of In-depth practitioner interviews and did not integrate any outcome measures to successful knowledge transfer in their approach. Practical implications - The paper offers guidelines for firms and specifically E&E managers to observe the specificity of knowledge and how this affects its limited applicability for other identical units.

We identify latent heterogeneity among our subjects, establishing that for users with a large number of Facebook friends, the only measure associated with trust is whether the dyad was tagged in a photo together. In contrast, for users that are more selective and have fewer Facebook friends, all three aforementioned tie strength measures correlate with trust.

Given the powerful information dissemination capabilities, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been suggested as interventions to build infant care awareness and to modify healthcare behaviors. We examine how the use of one ICT intervention-specifically, eHealth kiosks disseminating authenticated and accessible medical information-can alleviate the problem of high infant mortality in rural India. We investigate how mothers' social networks affect their use of eHealth kiosks, seeking professional medical care for their infants and, ultimately, infant mortality. Drawing on the social epidemiology and social networks literatures, we focus on advice and hindrance from both strong and weak ties as the conduit of social influence on mothers' health-related behaviors for the care of their infants. Over a period of 7 years, we studied 4,620 infants across 10 villages where the eHealth kiosks were implemented along with support resources for proxy use. The results revealed that (1) eHealth kiosk use promotes seeking professional medical care and reduces infant mortality, (2) mothers are especially vulnerable to hindrance from both strong and weak ties as they choose to maintain the status quo of traditional infant healthcare practices (e.g., reliance on untrained personnel, superstitions, fatalism) in villages, and (3) advice from both strong and weak ties offers the potential to break down misplaced beliefs about infant healthcare practices and to develop literacy on seeking professional medical care. In contrast, in a comparative group of 10 neighboring villages, the reduction in infant mortality was not as pronounced and the effect of professional medical care in reducing infant mortality was lower. Our findings suggest that an ICT intervention can effectively address one of society's most important problems (i.e., infant mortality) even in parts of the world with limited resources and deep suspicion of technology and change. Overall, we believe such an ICT intervention will complement other investments being made, including the facilitation of use (proxy use) and provision of professional medical facilities to reduce infant mortality.",,,,,"Rai, Arun/0000-0002-3655-7543",,,,,,,,,,,,0276-7783,,,,,JUN,2016,40,2,,,SI,,353,380,,10.25300/MISQ/2016/40.2.04,,,,,,,WOS:000376783300004,,,,,

This study focuses on the adoption of Twitter and its emerging community network structure in the Netherlands. Using the social network data of 2,152 journalists as retrieved from Twitter, analysis shows that the social network among journalists is well connected. The journalists who are extremely popular are also able to influence the flow of information through the network more than others (cf. gatekeeper role). Still, even though gatekeeping positions in the network are present due to the absence of specific relations, and the network consists of eight tightly knit network communities, the entire network is very well connected. The adoption of Twitter as a microblogging and networking service over time indicated that adoption increased particularly in early 2009. The possible consequences of these tightly knit communities for the production of news are discussed in terms of pack journalism, echo chambers, and information cascades.",,,,"Vergeer, Maurice/Q-6902-2019","Vergeer, Maurice/0000-0002-4802-4701",,,,,,,,,,,,0894-4393,1552-8286,,,,JUN,2015,33,3,,,,,277,297,,10.1177/0894439314539128,,,,,,,WOS:000354306600002,,,,,

A sociological perspective is introduced as the theoretical basis to analyze scientific fields, and the social network framework is adopted to develop a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the organization of science. This approach is then applied to study the Spanish Library and Information Science community from 1999 to 2007. The underlying notion is that science is organized work, in which the pursuit of impact shapes the specific scientific organization. This generates mutual dependence and control among researchers, which may restrict access when formally communicating with other scientific communities. On the other hand, scholarly journals facilitate the coordination of new knowledge and serve as platforms for interaction among scientists. Consequently, the interaction of well-defined groups of homogenous researchers, concentrated around particular sets of journals, leads to the formation of cohesive (sub)groups tied together by the degree of similarity of the researchers' competence.

These three variables were examined using objective data collected through Twitter's open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). We collected data concerning tweet overload through a web-based survey, and we used an ordered logistic regression analysis to examine the combined data (n = 1277). Results demonstrated that only the number of friends had a significantly positive effect on perceived tweet overload, while the number of tweets received did not produce a significant effect. Although the density of a user's egocentric network did not demonstrate any significant effect on perceived tweet overload, a significant interaction effect appeared between the number of friends and the density of this network. In other words, findings indicated that a large number of friends strengthened the network density's effect; by contrast, a smaller number of friends strengthened network density but reduced perceived tweet overload.

Specifically, the study examines how young people's connections on such sites are related to their risk of being involved in cyberharassment and cyberbullying. For this purpose, eighth-grade students from 11 secondary schools were surveyed (n = 1,458). The students indicated who their friends were at school and with whom they were connected on Facebook. The results demonstrate that victimization and perpetration are linked to the composition of one's network of online connections. The presence of many connections with fellow students who are not friends elevates the risk of cyberharassment and cyberbullying. In addition, perpetrators and victims have a disproportionally high number of connections based on unbalanced, weak friendships.

Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on a co-location project of the knowledge-intensive, multi-national company Novartis. To compare communication and collaboration patterns, we interviewed and observed employees before and after co-location into the ""co-location pilot"" and investigated a control group that was not co-located. The use of data and method triangulation as a research approach underlines the inherent dynamics of the co-location in this study. Findings - The study suggests findings leveraging knowledge sharing in two different ways. Co-location of dispersed project team members increases unplanned face-to-face communication leading to faster and more precise flows of knowledge by transcending knowledge boundaries. Co-location to an open multi-space environment stimulates knowledge creation by enabling socialization, externalization and combination of knowledge.

Accordingly, we conduct a laboratory experiment using teenagers and their parents as subjects, increasing the realism of the context by sampling potential pirates and their parents.

Interestingly, subjects respond negatively to advice from record labels over time, purchasing fewer songs as compared to other sources such as the subject's parent. The existence of a social tie between the adviser and the subject assists in mitigating piracy, especially when a parent is facing potential penalties due to his or her child's behavior. An external regulator, having no social tie or stake in the decision, provides the least credible source of advice, leading to the greatest amount of piracy.

This study aims to investigate how motors port companies use network ties to share and recombine knowledge and the learning that occurs both at the organizational and dyadic network levels. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a qualitative and inductive approach with the aim of developing theory from an in-depth examination of the dyadic ties between motorsport companies and the way they share and recombine knowledge. Findings - The research shows that motorsport companies having substantial competences at managing knowledge flows do so by getting advantage of bridging ties. While bridging ties allow motors port companies to reach distant and diverse sources of knowledge, their strengthening and the formation of relational capital facilitate the mediation and overlapping of that knowledge. Research limitations/implications - The analysis rests on a qualitative account in a single industry and does not take into account different types of inter-firm networks (e.g. alliances; constellations; consortia etc.) and governance structures. Cross-industry analyses may provide a more fine-grained picture of the practices used to recombine knowledge and the ideal composition of inter-firm ties. Practical implications - This study provides some interesting implications for scholars and managers concerned with the management of innovation activities at the interfirm level. From a managerial point of view, the recognition of the different roles played by network spanning connections is particularly salient and raises issues concerning the effective design and management of interfirm ties.

Design: The UMLS integrates knowledge from several biomedical terminologies. This knowledge call be used to discover implicit semantic relationships between concepts. In this paper, the authors propose a problem-independent approach for discovering potential terminological relationships that employs semantic abstraction of indirect relationship paths to perform classification and analysis of network theoretical measures Such as topological overlap, preferential attachment, graph partitioning, and number of indirect paths. Using different versions of the UMLS, the authors evaluate the proposed approach's ability to predict newly added relationships. Measurements: Classification accuracy, precision-recall. Results: Strong discriminative characteristics were observed with a semantic abstraction based classifier (classification accuracy of 91%), the average number of indirect paths, preferential attachment, and graph partitioning to identify potential relationships. The proposed relationship prediction algorithm resulted in 56% recall in top 10 results for new relationships added to subsequent versions of the UMLS between 2005 and 2007.

Nowadays, social media is significantly modifying the patterns in the use of technology to support knowledge management practices in teams. At the same time, the literature shows that transactive memory system (TMS), which refers to how team members share their distributed knowledge and expertise, is an important factor affecting team performance. However, minimal effort has been made to elaborate on the precise role of social media in supporting TMS for enhancing absorptive capacity (ACAP) and knowledge creation capability (KCC) of the team, which in turn might influence team creative performance (TCP). Therefore, to address this gap in the literature, a theoretical model is developed and validated. Survey data collected from 334 members of 68 knowledge work teams indicated that social media use at work has a positive relationship with TMS and both social media use at work and TMS are positively related to ACAP and KCC of the team. Results further indicated that ACAP positively influenced KCC, and both have a direct relationship with TCP. This study shows that careful investment in social media by an organization can enhance meta-knowledge of ""who knows what"" within teams. Finally, exploring external knowledge alone is not enough.

Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, a completely new methodology is applied by using a sample study of an international company's financial centre as an example. Computer software has been developed to simulate the network and calculate the percolation thresholds by combining its characteristics, thereby revealing what and to what extent connectivity and trust, respectively, influence knowledge sharing. Findings - The application of computer modelling to build up a percolation network is useful for answering questions about the determinants of knowledge sharing. Arguably, the authors demonstrate how the applied new methodology is superior in addressing how to measure the critical values of trust, connectivity and interaction issues, as well as leading to better insights about how these can be managed. The present paper confirms that trust is an essential factor influencing knowledge sharing and that there is a reciprocal effect between social interaction and trust. Practical implications - The model provides a useful tool for assessing features of the intra-organisational knowledge-sharing network and thus an important foundation for implementing actions in practice. The findings of this study imply that managers should consider the important role of task-related trust between actors and in general for knowledge sharing. With the help of percolation modelling, the degree of trust in an organisation can be computed, and this provides managers with an approach for managing trust. Originality/value - The topic of ""how can trust be measured"" is very important and is becoming even more important now because the financial crisis and other issues are raising questions about trust and moral compass rather than financial data. A percolation-based approach to studying knowledge sharing has not been researched in depth before now, and this study attempts to fill that gap.

The research reported in this paper looked at this issue, using data on more than one hundred US sociology departments. Our results showed that institutions that are more quantitative in character are more likely to favor journals over books as the dominant form of scientific communication and fare, in general, considerably better on the National Research Council's assessment than their qualitative equivalents. After controlling for differences in publication practices, the impact of research style declined but remained statistically significant.

Because of a common focus on communication, these perspectives can be combined as a set of methodologies. Latour's sociology of translations specifies a mechanism for generating variation in relations (associations), whereas Luhmann's systems perspective enables the specification of (functionally different) selection environments such as markets, professional organizations, and political control. Selection environments can be considered as mechanisms of social coordination that can self-organizebeyond the control of human agencyinto regimes in terms of interacting codes of communication. Unlike relatively globalized regimes, technological trajectories are organized locally in landscapes. A resulting duality of structure (Giddens, 1979) between the historical organization of trajectories and evolutionary self-organization at the regime level can be expected to drive innovation cycles. Reflexive translations add a third layer of perspectives to (a) the relational analysis of observable links that shape trajectories and (b) the positional analysis of networks in terms of latent dimensions. These three operations can be studied in a single framework, but using different methodologies. Latour's first-order associations can then be analytically distinguished from second-order translations in terms of requiring other communicative competencies. The resulting operations remain infrareflexively nested, and can therefore be used for innovative reconstructions of previously constructed boundaries.",,,,"Leydesdorff, Loet/E-2903-2010","Leydesdorff, Loet/0000-0002-7835-3098",,,,,,,,,,,,2330-1635,2330-1643,,,,NOV,2014,65,11,,,,,2359,2374,,10.1002/asi.23127,,,,,,,WOS:000344225200015,,,,,

SNA is used to investigate the effectiveness of a framework of methods adopted by the DREaM project to develop researcher-practitioner networks. Design/methodology/approach - Following a review of the literature on SNA, the paper reports longitudinal research from a whole population sample of the DREaM cadre of US researchers. Data were collected using a questionnaire at the start of the first DREaM project workshop, and at the final workshop. Data were analysed using Ucinet 6 software, and network diagrams were visualised using the Netdraw package. Findings - Findings demonstrate that the combination of linked workshops and use of social media throughout the DREaM project was successful in increasing the density of the researcher networks, forging new connections among participants. SNA was found to be a useful technique in investigating network development. Research limitations/implications - There is scope for further longitudinal research to investigate the sustainability and strength of the new network links forged. Originality/value - The use of SNA in the context of the development of researcher networks is novel in US research. The findings from this project indicate the potential of the DREaM methodology as a replicable framework for developing further research networks in other contexts. This paper represents a unique contribution in demonstrating through the use of SNA the extent of the extension of research networks afforded by the DREaM methodology.",,,,"Hall, Hazel JR/A-8511-2013","Hall, Hazel JR/0000-0003-2077-4778; Cooke, Louise/0000-0001-6155-4339",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0418,1758-7379,,,,,2013,69,6,,,,,786,806,,10.1108/JD-09-2012.0124,,,,,,,WOS:000326315100004,,,,,

During this time, parenting has received an unprecedented amount of attention from government, through legislation and policy initiatives, as well as becoming a regular topic in the news media, television programs, and for book publishers. The consequence of this social change is that parents today, arguably, face far greater pressure in terms of sifting and weighing the wide range of messages, opinions, and information targeted at them. Despite these social changes, parents and parenting have received comparatively little attention from researchers specifically examining their information literacy needs. This article is based upon research conducted using constructivist grounded theory and examines how a group of thirty-three parents in Leeds, United Kingdom looked for, accessed, and assessed information. The primary outcome of the research is a substantive grounded theory, which is framed within five categories: being a parent (core category); connectivity; trust; picture of self; weighing. These five categories describe how parents look for, access, and weigh information on a daily basis. This theory has implications for how organizations, services, and professionals convey information to parents. It also supports the notion of a need to view information literacy as part of a complex socially constructed paradigm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-2594,,,,,WIN,2012,60,3,,,,,546,568,,10.1353/lib.2012.0000,,,,,,,WOS:000301687100006,,,,,

Open innovation research networks are quantitatively investigated by combining network theory and keyword co-occurrence. Contour maps of open innovation are also created on the basis of networks for visualization. The networks and contour maps can be expressed differently by choosing different information as the main actors, such as the paper author, the institute, the country or the author-keywords, to reflect open innovation research structures in micro, meso, and macro-levels, respectively. The quantitative ways of exploring open innovation research structure are investigated to unveil important or emerging open innovation components as well as to demonstrate visualization of the structure of global open innovation research. The quantitative method provided in this project shows a possible way of visualizing and evaluating research community structure and thus a computerized calculation is possible for potential quantitative applications on open innovation research management, e.g. R&D resource allocation, research performance evaluation, and science map.

Several previous studies have highlighted how the structure of a social network can affect the dynamics of user interaction and information sharing.

Our claim is that while the information shared by influencers has a broader reach, the content of messages plays a critical role and can be a determinant of the social influence of the message irrespective of the centrality of the message's author. In this paper, we put forward four hypotheses supporting this claim by focusing on the sentiment of posts to characterize content and test them on a data set of 500,000 messages from Twitter in the tourism domain. Overall, our hypotheses posit that negative posts are more influential than positive ones. Results show how negative tweets are retweeted more than positive tweets.

They require considerable investments in personnel, time and money and impact just about every aspect of software firms. The group charged with conducting an SPI project has, however, little formal authority to influence or force software professionals to engage in SPI work or to define and implement changes. The SPI literature suggests that successful SPI initiatives depend on strong commitment from top management. But what should the SPI group do if management support is weak? In this paper, we present an analysis of how an SPI group can use alliances to obtain influence and succeed when management support is weak. Our study is based on a 3-year longitudinal field study of SPI change initiatives at Denmark Electronics. Our findings show that a lack of top management support is not necessarily incompatible with success. This research opens an important new area of research on intra-organizational alliances and information system (IS) implementation. It has the potential to offer new theories and practical advice on how IS implementation projects can be more effectively managed.

Recent studies suggest that individual scientists tend to favor either local or international ties. Yet there are good reasons to believe that both kinds of ties are beneficial for knowledge production. Since they allow for the more efficient management of social networks, Internet technologies are expected to resolve this inverse relationship. They are also expected to decentralize access to resources within developing regions that have traditionally reflected an urban male bias. Elaborating upon science, development and social network perspectives, we examine the impact of the Internet in the Chilean scientific community, addressing the questions 'to what extent is Internet use and experience associated with the size of foreign and domestic professional networks?' and 'are professional network resources equitably distributed across regional and demographical dimensions?' We offer results from a communication network survey of 337 Chilean researchers working in both academic departments and research institutes. We introduce a new measure, 'collaboration range', to indicate the extent to which scientists engage in work with geographically dispersed contacts. Results suggest that larger foreign networks are associated with higher email use and diversity, but local networks are smaller with longer use of the Internet. Diversity of email use is also associated with diverse geographical networks. Moreover, Internet use may be reducing the significance of international meetings for scientific collaboration and networking.

The factors affecting knowledge diffusion through social media networks (SMNs) need to therefore be better understood. Accordingly, this paper focuses on two SMN-specific characteristics - reputation mechanisms and the distribution of knowledge roles - which are argued to enhance and enable, respectively, the smooth transfer of knowledge in a SMN. To examine their effects, we distinguish between two types of reputation mechanisms - adaptive and objective - and across three distinct knowledge roles in SMNs: seekers, contributors and brokers. We argue that the extent of knowledge diffusion in the SMN depends on the type of mechanism and the relative distribution of these three roles. Using data collected through an agent-based simulation, we find that (a) the distribution of knowledge roles affects knowledge diffusion, with distributions consisted of more brokers outperforming others and (b) objective reputation mechanisms outperform adaptive mechanisms. Furthermore, we find that reputation mechanisms and distribution of knowledge roles interact to influence knowledge diffusion. The study's implications for future research and practice are discussed in the light of its limitations.

From an individual user's perspective, two types of information on peer consumption are salient for each song: total number of favorites by the community as a whole and favoriting by their social network friends. Correspondingly, we study two types of social influence: popularity influence, driven by the total number of favorites from the community as a whole, and proximity influence, due to the favoriting behavior of immediate social network friends. Our quasi-experimental research design applies a variety of empirical methods to highly granular data from an online music community. Our analysis finds robust evidence of both popularity and proximity influence. Furthermore, popularity influence is more important for narrow-appeal music compared to broad-appeal music.

Community-based link prediction methods are proposed to incorporate community information in order to achieve accurate prediction. However, the performance of such methods is sensitive to the selection of community detection algorithms, and they also fail to capture the correlation between link formulation and community evolution. In this paper we introduce a balanced Modularity-Maximization Link Prediction (MMLP) model to address this issue. The idea of MMLP is to integrate the formulation of two types of links into a partitioned network generative model. We proposed a probabilistic algorithm to emphasize the role of innerLinks, which correspondingly maximizes the network modularity. Then, a trade-off technique is designed to maintain the network in a stable state of equilibrium. We also present an effective feature aggregation method by exploring two variations of network features. Our proposed method can overcome the limit of several community-based methods and the extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world benchmark data demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.

We provide empirical evidence that contribution to knowledge communities leads to a higher likelihood of job-hopping, yet a greater amount of learning is associated with a higher probability of retention.

Infomediaries in PAC venues contribute to human development by enabling easier access to (1) information on education, health, government services and other social needs in the community (Social Impact); (2) information about jobs, employment, business opportunities, and agricultural resources (Economic Impact); and (3) information and communication resources to strengthen personal relationships and sense of belonging to a local and global community (Community Impact). This research sheds new light on the importance of the role of formal and informal infomediaries to strengthen the contribution of PAC to human development.",,,,,"Gomez, Ricardo/0000-0002-4878-660X",,,,,,,,,,,,0266-6669,1741-6469,,,,MAY,2012,28,2,,,,,117,131,,10.1177/0266666911429489,,,,,,,WOS:000309654600005,,,,,

This paper explores possible links between the two phenomena, looking specifically into the role of mobile phones in trans-Saharan migration. It provides a first detailed description of the telecommunication processes underlying contemporary trans-Saharan migration. An analytical framework is presented that helps to explain how mobile phones facilitate migration by interacting with the social and spatial factors shaping migrants' mobility. By drawing on this framework and fieldwork conducted among Congolese migrants in Morocco, it is shown that the expansion of the communication infrastructure is, on the one hand, only one of several factors that have turned the region into a more ""transitable"" space. On the other hand, the use of mobile phones is demonstrated to be central to the migration process: migrants draw on the unprecedented accessibility of contacts equipped with mobile phones to tie together novel, geographically expansive networks.

The paper seeks to argue that though some conceptualization of virtual presence has been made in the literature, this only took account of one's presence among a community of ""known"" others. Increasingly, however, in blogging and other online communities, users do not necessarily know the ""others"" but they nevertheless interact with them and develop friendships and lasting relationships. This stresses the multidimensional character of the study; one which sees presence as the core topic by considering different perspectives to it. Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory case study is conducted with a backpackers' blogging site, its members and audience; a setting that was considered suitable for finding answers to the research questions. The data are analysed qualitatively following a thematic analysis approach. Findings - It was found that the invisible and unknown audience has an important role to play in backpackers' presence online. In particular, the study highlights the role played by the audience in shaping the blogging experience and the sense of presence that this experience develops. Research limitations/implications - The exploratory case study carries a number of limitations. The findings are based on: reflections and views shared with the researchers by the bloggers, through interviews: a discussion forum; and on an enacted audience through their reflections. Practical implications - For practitioners, the study has implications in the areas of attracting and keeping audiences' interest and also in how to develop and support shared identity among independent travellers.

A typical approach used in recommendations is collaborative filtering. However, because it largely relies on external relations, such as items-to-items or users-to-users, problems occur when the relations are biased or insufficient. Focusing on that limitation, we here suggest a new method, item-network-based collaborative filtering, which recommends items through four steps. First, the system constructs item networks based on users' item usage history and calculates three types of centrality: betweenness, closeness, and degree. Next, the system secures significant items based on the betweenness centrality of the items in each user's item network. Then, by using the closeness and degree centrality of the secured items, the algorithm predicts preference scores for items and their rank orders from each user's perspective. In the last step, the system organizes a recommendation list based on the predicted scores. To evaluate the performance of our system, we applied it to a sample dataset of 196 Last.fm users' listening history and compared the results with those from existing collaborative filtering methods. The results showed that the suggested method performed better than the basic item-based and user-based collaborative filtering methods in terms of Accuracy, Recall, and F1 scores for top-k recommendations. This indicates that an individual user's item relations can be utilized to remedy the problems occurring when the external relations are biased or insufficient. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Results support our overall model relating weak-tie interactions to generalized trust. More importantly, when we use it to compare more and less sociable Facebook users, we find meaningful differences in the strength of the relationships between variables in the model. In particular, for more sociable users, interacting with weak ties was related to greater civic participation and increased feelings of generalized trust. Access to bridging social capital was a larger source of generalized trust for more sociable users as well.

Based on the analysis of the trajectories of prominent technologies, we can explore the phenomena of technology evolution and knowledge diffusion. In this study, we focus on explaining knowledge diffusion in the core technology used in fuel cells, i.e. the development of 5-layer membrane electrode assembly (MEA) technologies. Through an investigation of path analysis, this study explores how the knowledge of this technology has evolved and diffused across different locations. The empirical analysis also explains how certain technological knowledge plays a critical role in main path. In this study, patent data of 5-layer MEA technologies for fuel cells is collected from the US Patent Office, for a total of 1,356 patents, followed by constructing a patent citation network based on citation relationships, recognising prominent patents with many citations through path analysis. Using the local main path analysis and global key-route method, we identify three stages of technological development, including an improvement of the proton exchange membrane (PEM) and catalyst synthesis. Additionally, we use regression analysis to demonstrate that patents with specific characteristics play a vital role in the process of knowledge diffusion. Patents from Japan and South Korea are relatively more important than patents from other countries. The brokerage characteristics of a patent (e.g., coordinating domestically or liaising among three or more countries) also facilitate the diffusion of technological knowledge.

The success of Silicon Valley in particular has shown that university discoveries can spill over into regional economies to drive the emergence and growth of major new industries. From a public policy standpoint, the goal of 'creating more Silicon Valleys' has emerged as a major goal of recent technology policy. Evidence suggests that regional clusters focused on high technology only rarely develop. How do regional technology clusters emerge, and what makes them sustainable? A large literature has emerged attempting to answer this question. This article surveys three major perspectives on technology clusters: (1) approaches focused on universities as the anchor of regional clusters; (2) theories focusing on the development of social networks within clusters; and (3) institutional explanations. Each of these three approaches focuses on factors that are unquestionably important in explaining why some regions develop successful clusters while others do not. Each approach also yields a clear policy perspective and has itself influenced public policy. At best, each approach can, however, yield only a partial explanation of cluster success, but in combination they do reveal how complementary the perspectives are.

The fundamental idea of the model is that 'university' can play an enhanced role in innovation in knowledge-based societies and that the three helices - 'university', 'industry' and 'government' - interact in order to produce innovation and therefore regional and national economic growth. This is, however, only one model among several different systemic approaches for explaining regional differences in innovativeness. While the triple helix model emphasizes the role of the university for regional innovativeness, the other systemic approaches call attention to either industry or government as having the lead role in innovation. Further, the triple helix model is developed and primarily explored from a macro-level perspective and not from a firm-level perspective. Finally, while the theoretical value of triple helix interactions are reasonably confirmed, there are still gaps in the triple helix concept, and the practical value is only just beginning to realize its potential. From a firm-level perspective, the purpose of this article is therefore to test the applicability and practical value of the triple helix model when exploring the formation and growth of firms using the case of Google Inc. Useful when exploring a firm's formation and growth, the triple helix model forces the exploration to start even before the entrepreneur enters the scene, which provides a more holistic picture of firm formation. The three helices were all found to play important but changing roles in the different phases of firm formation and growth. The Google case contributes further understanding of the nature and historical evolution of interactions between the three helices, thereby filling some gaps in the triple helix concept. The Google case also identifies a number of mechanisms for interaction and the important role of the bridging organizations that connect the helices and contribute to the development of interactions.

Furthermore, investors with low social capital are often characterized by more intense reliance within narrow subgroups for investment information. Investors, especially those with high-investment risk profile, are truly hybrid information consumers.

In this outlook, blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that is already transforming and remodeling the relationships between all members of logistics and supply chain systems.

The present study, therefore, aims to bridge this gap, notably by helping understand the individual blockchain adoption behavior in the logistics and supply chain field in India and the USA. Drawing on the emerging literature on blockchain, supply chain and network theory, as well as on technology acceptance models (TAMs), we have developed a model based on a slightly-altered version of the classical unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The model being developed was then estimated using the Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).

A multidimensional approach to the role of social capital and locus of control,KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT RESEARCH & PRACTICE,,,,,,,,,,,,"This multidimensional study looks at the influence of social capital and internal vs external locus of control on tacit knowledge-sharing intention and behaviour, and the relationship between the two. The relations studied within the framework of the proposed model are tested by regression analyses. The findings indicate that social capital and its basic structural, cognitive, and relational dimensions tend to increase tacit knowledge-sharing intention, which gradually turns into behaviour because, according to Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour, behavioural intention is the immediate antecedent to behaviour (or according to Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour, a person's intention to perform a behaviour increases as subjective norms become more favourable). It is further concluded that having an internal locus of control increases both the intentions and behaviour, whereas external locus of control only increases the behaviour. The study also concludes that tacit knowledge-sharing intention gradually turns into sharing behaviour. The study is considered to contribute to the field of knowledge management in various ways.

It provides conceptual insights on social networks in geographically dispersed organizations, and how intra-organizational social interactions influence organizational behavior, employees relationship exchange inclination and innovation drive. Design/methodology/approach - A thematic literature review method was used to conduct an extensive review of relevant literature. Findings - Guided by the tenets of the social exchange theory, the authors' analysis and discussions elucidate how intra-organizational social network architecture can be developed, supported and utilized to drive innovations in geographically dispersed organizations. Research limitations/implications - A general limitation and perhaps also a strength of this type of conceptual paper is that it is a synthesis (thematic discursive analysis) of existing theory and published research. Thus, there are no primary empirical content. However, the issue of empirical evidence is nevertheless mediated by the fact that the discussions and argumentation process generate key propositions which could be validated in subsequent research endeavors. Also, the selection of relevant literature is restricted specifically to the topic of the study. The authors strived to ensure rigor through a robust and comprehensive literature review which was organized thematically according to all the key words in the main and sub-topics covered in Section 2. Practical implications - The insights presented suggest that management should pay serious attention to organizational design - that is, not only from the conventional contractual obligations point of view, but rather, the increasing importance of social capital should also be given some priority when thinking of resilient ways to encourage collaborations and efficient knowledge management. In other words, intra-organizational social network architecture should be considered as organizational capability and utilized as a toolset for the SIHRM to harness knowledge flow and unleash innovation. Social implications - As both bonding and bridging ties are not only critical for success of project teams but also intensify knowledge symmetry across different units of the organization, they are a major conduit for sustainable open innovation culture within organization. To develop competitive capabilities throughout the organization, it is important for the SIHRM to be involved in global networking, and as a network leader, the human resource management function must have an awareness of leading trends and developments in social networking. The ability to mobilize the appropriate resources and a sense of timing and context in implementing such architecture within the geographically spread organization is crucial. Originality/value - The novel contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the study provides an implementable framework which scholars and practitioners could use to develop and test the actualization of an intra-organizational social network architecture in a geographically dispersed organization. Second, the study has provided some key propositions and a well-grounded direction for further research to inspire further development/extension of the social exchange theory.",,,,,"Oparaocha, Gospel/0000-0001-7860-016X",,,,,,,,,,,,1367-3270,1758-7484,,,,,2016,20,3,,,,,534,556,,10.1108/JKM-06-2015-0212,,,,,,,WOS:000379818700008,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were used to explore the information behaviour of 12 transgendered participants. This study represents a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach. A qualitative content analysis was used in analysing the data with categories derived from previous research and research questions. Findings - Serendipity played an important role at the beginning of the participants' information seeking phase: the young individual would not have terms corresponding to his or her experience because of the invisibility of the transgender phenomenon in the culture. The barriers to seeking information were psychological, demographic, role-related or interpersonal, environmental or source characteristic. Fear was apparent as a barrier in the surrounding culture often caused by expectations, attitudes in the family environment and people around. Source characteristic barriers were related to the lack of terms and vocabulary required to seek information and also the lack of the information itself. Information about transgender and gender minorities was essential in building up a clear gender identity, and the most relevant information sources of this sort of information this were other transgendered people and the experience-based information they had shared.

The focus of most related research and management actions has been on the top management or project management levels. However, conflicts frequently arise within the line organization when applications are extended, enhanced, maintained, or otherwise changed operationally outside software development projects. This study focuses on the impact of relationships at the application-change level and strives to identify and explain favorable social structures for effective business/IT dialog at the operational level. We collected data in seven comprehensive case studies, including 88 interviews and corresponding surveys, and applied social network analysis to show that three social structures at the implementation level influence the degree to which IT applications are maintained and enhanced in line with business requirements: (1) interface actors connecting business and IT, (2) the relationships between interface actors and the corresponding unit, and (3) the relationships between interface actors and other employees in their unit. In three cases, less favorable structures are revealed that correspond to low application change effectiveness and software applications that do not meet business requirements. The other cases benefit from favorable social structures and thus enhance fulfillment of business requirements and result in higher IT business value.

The objective of this paper is to address this gap in the literature, ultimately enhancing understanding of the link between the structural configuration of social capital and individual learning. Design/methodology/approach - An online questionnaire survey was administered to employees affiliated to 22 pharmacies in Sweden to gather attributional and relational data on the individual level. Social network analysis techniques were used to describe salient structural characteristics of individuals' social capital. The impact of social capital on individual learning was explored through ordinal logistic regression models based on maximum likelihood estimations. Findings - The presence of structural holes initially increases the degree of individual learning, then reaches a maximum and begins to gradually decrease. Practical implications - The results of the study provide valuable input for the development and management of networks within firms, in order to improve learning and innovation. In addition, given the close proximity between learning, as conceptualized in this study and other job attitudes, human resource management practices in general could benefit greatly from the results. Originality/value - In this paper, the authors focus on the structural configuration of social capital, more specifically structural holes, and its inter-relationship with learning.

The discussion focuses on two sets of variables influencing member performance: the embeddedness of the network and the use of different media. Three dimensions of embeddedness are distinguished: (1) embeddedness in practice: the extent to which the knowledge shared in the network is integrated in members' (local) practices; (2) structural embeddedness: the extent to which network members are connected to each other and know who knows what; and (3) relational embeddedness: the extent to which the network is characterized by strong social ties. In terms of communication media, information and communication technology (ICT)-enabled and face-to-face interaction are distinguished. A survey study among 206 members of different NoPs reveals that all three forms of embeddedness are important antecedents of NoP member performance (explaining 43% of the variance in performance) and that these forms are interrelated. Furthermore, ICT use positively influences embeddedness in practice, whereas face-to-face communication contributes to the structural and relational embeddedness of an NoP. This contributes to knowledge management and ICT literature in general and NoP theory in particular.

In academia, successful researchers have been found more likely to be persistent in publishing, but little attention has been given to how persistence in maintaining collaborative relationships affects career success. This paper proposes a new bibliometric understanding of persistence that considers the prominent role of collaboration in contemporary science. Using this perspective, we analyze the relationship between persistent collaboration and publication quality along several dimensions: degree of transdisciplinarity, difference in coauthor's scientific age and their scientific impact, and research-team size. Contrary to traditional wisdom, our results show that persistent scientific collaboration does not always result in high-quality papers. We find that the most persistent transdisciplinary collaboration tends to output high-impact publications, and that those coauthors with diverse scientific impact or scientific ages benefit from persistent collaboration more than homogeneous compositions. We also find that researchers persistently working in large groups tend to publish lower-impactpapers. These results contradict the colloquial understanding of collaboration in academia and paint a more nuanced picture of how persistent scientific collaboration relates to success, a picture that can provide valuable insights to researchers, funding agencies, policy makers, and mentor-mentee program directors.

It is the premise of this paper that generating emotional value (E-value) in social media and networking sites (SMNS) is critical for the survival of new e-service ventures. Hence, by introducing a formal value theory as a coding scheme, we report a study on E-value in SMNS by analyzing how a Swedish start-up industrial design company attempted to build a global presence by creating followers on the web. The aim of the study was to investigate how the company's website design and communication can affect eWOM over time. This was done by capturing a series of ""emoticon and value expressions"" generated by community members from three different e-communication campaigns (2011-2012) with changing website content, hence giving different stimuli to viewers. Those members who expressed emotional value, often incorporating emoticons, displayed both shorter verbal expressions and reaction time. These value expressions, we suggest, are important aspects of eWOM and need to be actively taken into account. The study has implications for information management strategies through using eWOM.

Based on the publication data from 1992 to 2012, extracted from three databases, we used the co-authorship network from the period 1992-2001 for the specification of nine structural effects to predict individual performance in the 2002-2012 period. Employing the auto-logistic actor attribute models allowed the inclusion of six actor attributes and the analysis of their effects simultaneously with network effects. The results show that future performance is dependent on the national and disciplinary network both in the psychology field and in the sociology field. When controlling for actor attribute effects, these structural effects play a significant role only in sociology, where activity in the network is a negative predictor and having a tie with an actor who is going to be above average in productivity is a positive predictor of the outcome. Institution type in psychology, age and the previous productivity in sociology are significant actor attribute effects. We used log-odds to demonstrate the probabilities of the outcome for three prototypical egonet structures: open, closed and complex; with different numbers of alters with attribute.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors distributed questionnaires at random on the streets of certain densely populated areas in Hong Kong to young urbanites, who are the dominant users of technological social media. The authors collected 492 valid responses, which the authors analysed via multivariate regression analysis. Findings - Mobile messages are more effectively used to share information within strongly tied groups rather than weakly tied groups. However, there is little difference between weakly and strongly connected groups in terms of the perceived effectiveness of mobile messages used for social networking. Anxious people are more inclined to send mobile messages to individuals with whom they have weak ties, and people who perceived TSs send more mobile messages to individuals with whom they have strong ties. Research limitations/implications - The rapid nature of information and communication technology has enabled new ""richer"" forms of mobile media. For instance, WhatsApp allows people to attach images and other multimedia files to their messages, and WeChat provides a location-sharing service that enables users to meet new people based on their friendship preferences. Future studies should examine this trend. Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature by elaborating the mobile-messaging behaviour of urban citizens who are anxious and perceive TSs within strongly and weakly connected social groups.",,,,,"CHO, Wing Sing Vincent/0000-0003-0726-8352",,,,,,,,,,,,0959-3845,1758-5813,,,,,2015,28,3,,,,,544,569,,10.1108/ITP-07-2013-0122,,,,,,,WOS:000360114600006,,,,,

The theory of IT affordances provides a basis for theorizing how the use of online social commerce (OSC) technology facilitates the formation of social ties in an OSC context. In this paper, integrating theories of IT affordances and social ties, we develop a model to explore how the six sub-dimensions of OSC IT affordances (i. e., visibility, metavoicing, triggered attending, guidance shopping, social connecting, and trading) aid buyers and sellers in building strong and weak OSC ties. A survey of 511 buyers from WeChat shows that five of the six IT affordances enhance the quality of interactivity, and thereby facilitate social ties (both strong and weak), which in turn contribute to buyers' repurchase intentions. Additionally, the findings confirm the positive moderating effect of perceived effectiveness of e-commerce institutional mechanisms (PEEIM) on the strong tie formation process.

However, because users of these forums tend not to have formal medical training, they often cannot verify objectively the soundness of the advice provided. Thus, there is a need to understand better the mechanism through which people trust and utilise information found on these forums. In testing a theory-based trust model, we find that forum users accept advice more readily as they develop cognitive trust (trust based on a cognitive assessment) and/or affective trust (trust based on an emotional connection). Affective trust is also closely related to formation of relational closeness. This indicates that, while both forms of trust are important, the development of emotional connections provides for long-term OHCs interactions. Findings here, indicate that prior exchanges are not needed to accessand utiliseOHC community resources.However, trust (developed through prior exchanges) is required for a recipient toleverage the contributor's social capital for information adoption and relational closeness. These findings allow the distribution of social capital to be viewed in terms of an asymmetrical model where it is possible to accept capital, in the form of advice, without first demonstrating trustworthiness. In the OHC setting the onus is on the contributor of advice to establish trustworthiness, whereas traditionally social capital theory requires receivers of capital to establish trust.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework explaining consumer engagement with electronic word of mouth (eWOM) communication via SNS, based on key attributes of this media channel. Design/methodology/approach Based on the expectancy value theory (EVT), a conceptual framework is proposed to model the effect of eWOM channel attributes on eWOM engagement process. Consumer eWOM engagement is conceptualized as a second-order construct. A structural equation modeling procedure was employed to empirically test the model using data collected from two social media communication channels. Findings First, results suggest that engagement with eWOM can be conceptualized as a second-order construct based on user tendency to receive or share eWOM with other network members. Second, the path analysis model supports the employment of EVT and shows that two key attributes of eWOM channels, social capital and credibility, significantly affect consumer attitude toward eWOM via SNS. Attitude toward eWOM, in turn, affects eWOM engagement. Third, SNS channel type moderates the effect on attitude. Practical implications Marketing communication practitioners should note that the strength of social ties plays a key role in spreading eWOM on SNS effectively. This insight should be employed a part of social media marketing strategy.

We integrate ultimatum game theory, which focuses on fairness, with motivation theories to investigate the effects of social distance and monetary incentives on the performance of three competing designs for online referral systems: rewarding only or primarily the proposer, rewarding only or primarily the responder, and dividing the reward equally or fairly between the proposer and responder. A set of controlled laboratory and randomized field experiments were conducted to test how the fairness of the split of the reward (equal/fair versus unequal/unfair split of the referral bonus) and social distance (small versus large) between the proposer and the responder jointly affect the performance of online referral systems (the proposer sending an offer and the responder accepting the offer). For a large social distance (acquaintances or weak tie relationships), equally splitting the referral bonus results in the best performance. However, for a small social distance (friends or strong tie relationships), an equal split of the referral reward does not improve referral performance, which suggests that under a small social distance, monetary incentives may not work effectively. Face validity and external validity (generalizability) are ensured using two distinct measures of social distance across several contexts.

However, different websites may have different interpersonal interactive mechanisms. Therefore, the results of this study should not be over-generalized. Practical implications - For diffusing information, BSPs may focus on blog articles with trackback rate below 10 percent among the friends-bloggers network and advertise these articles to make their trackback rate increase to 10-20 percent to reach the self-sustaining status.

Using the Journal Citation Reports 2011, 2012, and 2013, we analyze triad formation as indicators of integration (specialty growth) and disintegration (restructuring). The strongest integration is found among the large journals that report on studies in different scientific specialties, such as PLoS ONE, Nature Communications, Nature, and Science. This tendency toward large-scale integration has not yet stabilized. Using the Islands algorithm, we also distinguish 51 local maxima of integration. We zoom into the cited articles that carry the integration for: (i) a new development within high-energy physics and (ii) an emerging interface between the journals Applied Mathematical Modeling and the International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology. In the first case, integration is brought about by a specific communication reaching across specialty boundaries, whereas in the second, the dyad of journals indicates an emerging interface between specialties. These results suggest that integration picks up substantive developments at the specialty level.

Social media-assisted collective action has attracted much attention from journalists, political observers, and researchers of various disciplines. In this article, the authors study transnational online collective action through the lens of inter-network cooperation. The authors analyze interaction and support between the women's rights networks of two online collective actions: 'Women to Drive' (primarily Saudi Arabia) and 'Sexual Harassment' (global). Methodologies used include: extracting each collective action's social network from blogs authored by female Muslim bloggers (23 countries), mapping interactions among network actors, and conducting sentiment analysis on observed interactions to provide a better understanding of inter-network support. The authors examine these two distinct but overlapped networks of collective actions and discover that brokering and bridging processes can facilitate the diffusion of information, coalition formation, and the expansion of the networks. The broader goal of the study is to examine the dynamics between interconnected collective actions. This research contributes to understanding the mobilization of social movements in digital activism and the role of cooperative networks in online collective action.",,,,"Lim, Merlyna/G-7944-2015","Lim, Merlyna/0000-0002-1583-9920",,,,,,,,,,,,1062-7375,1533-7995,,,,OCT-DEC,2014,22,4,,,,,1,20,,10.4018/jgim.2014100101,,,,,,,WOS:000353298600001,,,,,

This creativity can attract audiences and generate commercial success for blog service providers (BSPs). Thus to obtain competitive advantage, such providers should stimulate their bloggers to produce creative content. The purpose of this paper is to adopt social embeddedness and creativity theory to explore factors influencing blogger creativity. Design/methodology/approach - An online questionnaire and an online embeddedness system are used to collect data from 353 bloggers, including data on their motivation, integration ability, structural and relational embeddedness and creativity. Hierarchical regression is applied for statistical analysis. Findings - Analytical results show that structural embeddedness and relational embeddedness affect blogger creativity. Additionally motivation negatively moderates the relationship between structural embeddedness and creativity, and integration ability negatively moderates the relationship between relational embeddedness and creativity. Research limitations/implications - This study applies social embeddedness to elucidate the relationships among quantity and quality of professional knowledge and creativity. This study also discusses the moderating effect of motivation and integration ability on the relationship between social embeddedness and creativity. Practical implications - Creative articles by bloggers can popularise a blog platform, as they can retain bloggers and attract new bloggers. Therefore, for BSPs enhancing the creative performance of bloggers is one way to obtain competitive advantage.

Such deviations can hinder senior managers from governing their IT organizations effectively because they do not know how work really gets done. This paper develops an explanation for why actual structures differ from planned structures. Understanding this phenomenon is indispensable for managers to govern the real organization, to uphold compliance with important standards (e.g., ITIL, COBIT), to decide whether the formal or the actual organization is more effective, and, finally, to identify management actions that support the optimal structure. To develop this understanding, we analyze the interaction structures at the interface between firms' business units and IT units in four rich cases, using data from 56 interviews and 47 questionnaires, and applying qualitative methods and social network analysis, which give us deep insights into planned and actual interaction among employees. We test two different explanations for deviations of actual from planned interaction structures and find that boundary-spanning theory provides the dominant explanation for such deviations: Inclined to span the business/IT boundary most effectively, the actors involved deviate from planned structures especially when other structures offer better boundary-spanning potential, which is influenced primarily by cross-domain knowledge. In addition, relationships also play an important role. On the positive side, relationships provide opportunities for such deviations, while on the negative side, a conflict-laden relationship might hinder deviations even if they were advantageous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0268-3962,1466-4437,,,,DEC,2013,28,4,,,SI,,333,353,,10.1057/jit.2013.23,,,,,,,WOS:000327910800006,,,,,

When Weibo (Microblogging) Meets the ""New Generation"" of Rural Migrant Workers",LIBRARY TRENDS,,,,,,,,,,,,"The rapid development of social media has had a profound impact on how people access and share information in China. Some researchers suggest that the new social media has broken through the monolithic propaganda of traditional Chinese media and brought a diversity of topics and perspectives into view. Others argue that platforms such as Weibo (microblogging) largely privilege the opinions of well-educated, middle class individuals, keeping working class industrial and rural workers' voices on the margins. The question remains: has the development of social media bridged or deepened the ""digital divide""? In an effort to address this question, this paper explores the appearance of members of a ""new generation"" of migrant workers on Sina Weibo, the most popular microblogging service in China. Drawing on the results a study of Sina Weibo posts, reposts, and authors, this paper offers three main arguments: (1) Weibo is not only a means for sharing information and expressing opinions, it is also a platform where users mobilize to improve the lives of migrant workers in cities; (2) Weibo provides an emotional outlet, offering members of the ""new generation"" of migrant workers the opportunity to express dissatisfaction with the bitter reality of their lives and a longing for a better life; and (3) The most influential users of this microblogging platform tend to be media figures, scholars, government officials, and other individuals from outside the community.

In the market, users can access a repository of knowledge for a single price (repository pricing) or knowledge items in the repository can be sold individually (knowledge pricing). However, users have been found to prefer repository pricing but not the knowledge in the repository. This irrationality can cause market failure because users derive a suboptimal level of utility from the knowledge repository, and vendors have contradictory pricing and knowledge strategies. We empirically examine a joint explanation from two competing theoretical perspectives that accounts for this inconsistency nicely: The mental accounting perspective endorses repository pricing because it entices users with the benefits of the whole repository, whereas the transaction decoupling perspective finds expression in individually priced knowledge because it prevents the discrete benefit of knowledge from becoming obscure. By integrating the two theoretical perspectives and considering price, knowledge, and user characteristics simultaneously, the results offer important implications for the market transfer of knowledge. Repository pricing attracts users and is essential to initiate the transfer process, whereas knowledge pricing generates knowledge preference and is thus an effective approach for learning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0742-1222,,,,,WIN,2007,24,3,,,,,79,108,,10.2753/MIS0742-1222240303,,,,,,,WOS:000252906300004,,,,,

This change has included waves of technological disruption that have been exploited by entrepreneurial actors who seize the associated new opportunities. Research on related phenomena is spread across different disciplines. Recently, there have been calls for further research on the marriage of information systems (IS) and entrepreneurship. We review 292 articles in the IS, entrepreneurship, and general and strategic management literature to create an overview of the IT-associated entrepreneurship research landscape. On the basis of that review, we elaborate on the different roles that IT can assume to support entrepreneurial operations and value creation in these settings. Our findings suggest that IT plays four major roles in entrepreneurial operations: as a facilitator, making the operations of start-ups easier; as a mediator for new ventures' operations; as an outcome of entrepreneurial operations; and as a ubiquity, becoming the business model itself. Leveraging these roles of IT, we develop a set of definitions to clear up definition uncertainties surrounding IT-associated new ventures such as digital start-ups and digital business models.

Findings - The distribution of resources in the area of KM based on the publication year indicates that this field of study, during time intervals 1900 to 1980, has seen eight major mutations. A considerable influence of such fields as economics, business, social networks analysis, organizational learning and economic sociology on the realm of KM is evident. The association of Polanyi with the mutations of 1958, 1962 and 1967 suggests his obvious influence on the evolution of KM. The ratio of articles to books among the whole documents detected by RPYS was 2-13 which could direct us to the point that the channel for information transformation in KM is more focused on books than on articles. Originality/value - None of the few studies done by scientometric methods in the realm of KM has been seen through the issue of the historical origins of this area. This piece of research, using a new scientometric method, can be considered the first study in which the origins of KM over time have been studied.",,,,"Khasseh, Ali Akbar/W-4434-2017","Khasseh, Ali Akbar/0000-0001-5664-4671",,,,,,,,,,,,1367-3270,1758-7484,,,,,2016,20,6,,,,,1393,1404,,10.1108/JKM-01-2016-0019,,,,,,,WOS:000387178100012,,,,,

Through this paper we report on an exploratory study into the design and use of neighbourhood book exchanges in North America. We identify dominant media framings of these book exchanges in North America, along with claims made concerning the influence of the exchanges. We compare the media claims with insights from interviews with the stewards of six book exchanges in an urban centre of the Pacific Northwest and weekly inventories of the six exchanges. Method. We collected and analysed over 150 newspaper and media articles, conducted weekly extensive inventories of six book exchanges for three months and interviewed stewards of the six book exchanges at the beginning and end of our inventory period. Analysis. We draw upon grounded theory analytic methods as developed by Kathy Charmaz. Results. We provide the first empirically rigorous investigation focused on the information practices associated with neighbourhood book exchanges. Conclusions. Through this work we provide an initial framing of the neighbourhood book exchange phenomenon. Most significantly, the neighbourhood book exchange stewards in this study actively work to design and support local information practices, reinvigorating and sustaining relationships with their neighbours.",,,,"Nathan, Lisa P./O-3878-2015","Nathan, Lisa P./0000-0003-2895-727X",,,,,,,,,,,,1368-1613,,,,,SEP,2015,20,3,,,,,,,684,,,,,,,,WOS:000362729700011,,,,,

As such, their structure both constrains and is constrained by social processes such as partnership formation and the spread of information, opinions, and behavior. Models of these coevolutionary network dynamics exist, but they are generally limited to specific interaction types such as games on networks or opinion dynamics. Here we present a dynamic model of social network formation and maintenance that exhibits the characteristic features of real-world social networks such as community structure, high clustering, positive degree assortativity, and short characteristic path length. Although these macrostructural network properties are stable, the network microstructure undergoes continuous change at the level of relationships between individuals. Notably, the edges are weighted, allowing for gradual change in relationship strength in contrast to more abrupt mechanisms, such as rewiring, used in other models. We show how the structural features that characterize social networks can arise as the result of constraints placed on the interactions between individuals. Here we explore the relationship between structural properties and four idealized constraints placed on social interactions: space, affinity, time, and history. We show that spatial embedding and the subsequent constraints on possible interactions are crucial in this model for the emergence of the structures characterizing social networks.",,,,,"Brailsford, Sally/0000-0002-6665-8230",,,,,,,,,,,,0894-4393,1552-8286,,,,JUN,2014,32,3,,,,,373,392,,10.1177/0894439313511934,,,,,,,WOS:000340090200007,,,,,

There has not been any systematic empirical study of the dynamics of emerging coordination behaviour and knowledge transfer process during a disease outbreak. In this paper, we first introduce our approach for the analysis of multi-agency intervention during a disease outbreak using the study of social networks. Using social networks and its analytic framework, we explore questions such as: How does the multi-agency coordination emerge for supporting the complex knowledge transfer process during different phases of disease outbreak? How effective are these formal and informal coordination mechanisms in achieving a robust outcome in response coordination through effective knowledge transfer process during the outbreak? What are the key lessons learned by studying the emerging coordination and knowledge transfer process during past disease outbreak in improving the multi-agency preparedness for dealing with future outbreaks? The discussion is supported by a qualitative study of the implementation of the results of the analysis.

While many of the issues associated with such environments are technological in nature, this paper focuses on the social aspect of the shift to a nomadic computing environment, and examines its impact of employees' ability to effectively collaborate with one another. Studying changes at the individual level, we argue that an increase in workers' social mobility, brought upon by the move to a nomadic computing environment, is likely to have a negative effect on their social capital.

This article results from a qualitative study of 1) information behavior in community problem-solving framed as a distributed information use environment and 2) approaches used by a best-practice library to anticipate information needs associated with community problem solving. Method. Several approaches to data collection were used-focus groups, interviews, observation of community and library meetings, and analysis of supporting documents. We focused first on the information behavior of community groups. Finding that the library supported these activities we sought to understand its approach. Analysis. Data were coded thematically around both information behavior concepts and themes germane to problem-solving activity. A grounded theory approach was taken to capture aspects of the library staff's practice. Themes evolved from the data; supporting documentation-reports, articles and library communication was also coded. Results. The study showed 1) how information use environment components (people, setting, problems, problem resolutions) combine in this distributed information use environment to determine specific information needs and uses; and 2) how the library contributed to the viability of this distributed information use environment. Conclusion. Community problem solving, here explicated as a distributed information use environment, is likely to be seen in multiple communities. The library model presented demonstrates that by reshaping its information practice within the framework of an information use environment, a library can anticipate community information needs as they are generated and where they are most relevant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1368-1613,,,,,JUL,2006,11,4,,,,,,,262,,,,,,,,WOS:000241414700004,,,,,

Following a review of electronic vis a vis social networks, the paper foresees the latter as crucial in the construction and diffusion of new knowledge in an IS community. A main contribution of the paper is that it utilizes a variety of disciplinary perspectives in order better to understand and improve use of information in organizations. This approach is in line with the view that in the future transdisciplinary forms of knowledge production will make traditional, disciplinary-based knowledge domains largely obsolete (Gibbons, 1995) and that knowledge relevant to IS professionals will be no different in this respect. Given this, the future role of the IS professional is portrayed here as that of a key change agent in the development, diffusion, and implementation of new ideas. A primary activity is foreseen as being one of bringing together and synthesising information, ideas, and practices from a range of disciplines with the focus being on information leading to the development of knowledge leading to the development of knowledge and expertise within organizations, not systems per se.

Design/methodology/approach - The study draws on the conceptual analysis of 31 key investigations characterizing the nature of the above theories. Their potential is examined in light of an illustrative example of seeking information about job opportunities. Findings - SDT approaches motivation by examining the degree to which one can make volitional choices while meeting the needs of autonomy and competence. Information-seeking behaviour is most volitional when it is driven by intrinsic motivation, while such behaviours driven by extrinsic motivation and amotivation are less volitional. Modern EVTs approach the motivators for information seeking by examining the individual's beliefs related to intrinsic enjoyment, attainment value, utility value and relative cost of information seeking. Both theories provide useful alternatives to traditional concepts such as information need in the study of the motivators for information seeking. Research limitations/implications - As the study focusses on two cognitive psychological theories, the findings cannot be generalised to all represent all categories relevant to the characterisation of triggers and drivers of information seeking.

Building on prior research on thinking styles and social impact theory, the current work examines the interplay between user, social network, and system design characteristics in social product-customization systems as drivers of whether consumers conform to input received from others on their customized products and of their evaluation of these products. Evidence from one field study and four experiments shows that consumers with more holistic (vs. analytic) thinking styles make more conforming product modifications when receiving public rather than private peer input, and this greater conformity to peer input boosts (vs. diminishes) consumers' evaluation of customized products when they feel close (vs. distant) to input providers.

The objective of this work is to investigate the role of individual scientists and their collaborations in enhancing the knowledge flows, and consequently the scientific production. The methodology involves two main phases. First, the data on all the nanotechnology journal publications in Canada was extracted from the SCOPUS database to create the co-authorship network, and then employ statistical data mining techniques to analyze the scientists' research performance and partnership history. Also, a questionnaire was sent directly to the researchers selected from our database seeking the predominant properties that make a scientist sufficiently attractive to be selected as a research partner. In the second phase, an agent-based model using Netlogo has been developed to study the network in its dynamic context where several factors could be controlled. It was found that scientists in centralized positions in such networks have a considerable positive impact on the knowledge flows, while loyalty and strong connections within a dense local research group negatively affect the knowledge transmission.

This study also investigates how living in Europe can influence the behavior and attitudes of the sampled individuals from the Turkish Diaspora of Germany, Belgium and Netherlands during the period when the Gezi Park demonstration took place. Our results make it clear that social media were used by those who supported the protest movement, while those who opposed the protest movement primarily used or followed traditional sources of media, including Turkish and European television. Furthermore, supporters amongst the diaspora for the Gezi-protests were primarily active in accruing social capital through bonding and social networking among those who belong to the Turkish diaspora under the guise of the Gezi Park protests. Finally, a significant number of the supporters of the protests in the three countries took part in several different means of supporting the movement, including: disseminating awareness about the Gezi protests through social media, engaging in meetings, and in some cases, even severing contact with friends and acquaintances who did not share their support for the protest movement.

Social relation has been conceptualized in terms of how organizational relationships with social entities facilitate and/or inhibit organizational learning. In particular, we examine how two different relational structures single vendor dominant model and multi-vendor dominant model are associated with two types of organizational learning, namely, exploitative and exploratory. Furthermore, we investigate how three critical dimensions structural (core vs. non-core functions), affective (partnership vs. transaction), and cognitive (business value vs. IT capability) in social relation affect the relationships between the two relational structures and the two types of organizational learning in the context of IT outsourcing. The proposed hypotheses were tested using 203 Korean client firms that have adopted the multi-vendor approach in IT outsourcing. Results reveal that the single vendor dominant model exerts a more significant effect on exploitative learning than exploratory learning. By contrast, the multi-vendor dominant model has a more significant effect on the latter than the former. Furthermore, out of the six moderating variables, four (core IT function, non-core IT function, partnership relationship, and transaction relationship) have significant influences on exploitative and exploratory, learning. We conclude with theoretical contributions in the area of social relation theory and IT outsourcing literature, and implications for practices on how clients can enhance engagement in exploitative and exploratory learning to reap the benefits of multi-vendor outsourcing.

Structural equation modeling was used to enable the identification of simultaneous interactive relationships among the three research variables. Findings - Contrary to previous research results, transactive memory systems were found not to be significantly related to organizational innovation. Results also indicated that transactive memory systems comprise a statistically significant variable that influences developmental leadership. Subsequently, developmental leadership can be considered to be a valid construct in predicting organizational innovation; it can also be seen to fully mediate the relationship between transactive memory systems and organizational innovation.

However, obtaining top management support is often considered outside the IT project team's control. In this paper, we investigate how IT project teams can obtain such support. We find that creating and mobilizing social capital through repeated interaction with top managers and their confidants helps a project obtain top management support. Also, a failure to use social capital to engage top management can cause a decrease in their support. We demonstrate these points through a natural experiment of the support of three division heads and their corresponding divisions in the implementation of an enterprise system.

Path-based features are found to be particularly useful in predicting collaborations. Besides, the combination of path-based and attribute-based features achieves almost the same performance as the combination of all features considered. Inspired by the findings, we propose an agent-based model to simulate the dynamics of collaborations. The model merges the ideas of network structure and node attributes by leveraging random walk mechanism and interests similarity. Empirical results show that the model could reproduce a number of realistic and critical network statistics and patterns. We further apply the model to predict collaborations in an unsupervised manner and compare it with several state-of-the-art approaches.

While companies are compelled to manage exploration projects, the processes underlying the expansion of knowledge in these projects are not well known. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the literature, this paper first presents a conceptual view of the notion of expert. Then, the research question is analyzed by means of a case study of a polar expedition. The project leader seeks a knowledgeable person who has never been identified as an expert, but whose knowledge is essential. Findings - The expert appears both in his cognitive and social dimensions. Moreover, he emerges out of the situation, on the basis of neither strong nor weak signals. The rationality of expert solicitation falls within a pragmatic logic where the acquired knowledge must reduce the uncertainty so that the project can progress. The learning process enables to increase gradually the knowledge of the actor but also to build the legitimacy required in order to have access to the expert. Practical implications - Findings can be translated in more general situations. Indeed, polar expeditions projects and exploratory innovation projects (Garel and Lievre, 2010) possess some common characteristics: lack of knowledge concerning, timing issues, need to implement a pragmatic, enquiry-based learning. These projects strongly rely on external expert knowledge. This case study suggests that, while it may be useful, planning should not strictly define the course of action. A central competence of the project leader is to manage the duality between planning and adaptation. This implies the ability to adapt, to detect and to assess human resources and knowledge flows rapidly, as well as to weave social links inside and outside the organisation. Originality/value - The existing literature offers a comprehensive view of experts in an organisation. However, the questions of expert selection and identification remain open. This paper fills a gap in the literature concerning the way experts are identified and selected. The case study shows that identifying experts does not solely depend on weak signals (reputation) or on strong signals (the expert's social status). Rather, the expert emerges in the situation, in an unexpected way. The expert's social dimension is not sufficient and one must look to the cognitive roots of the expertise. On the other hand, the fact is emphasised that the expert is a social construct which emerges from the solicitation process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1367-3270,1758-7484,,,,,2015,19,5,,,SI,,900,911,,10.1108/JKM-02-2015-0061,,,,,,,WOS:000369179200002,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach - The research used a case study approach consistent with the purpose of exploring control/knowledge transfer relationships. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with managers across 19 sites in an MNE. Analysed data were thematically organised into two case studies for comparison. Findings - The results show that when control is exerted from bottom-up, knowledge transfer barriers are overcome, quality of outcomes is increased and new and incremental knowledge innovation is more likely to become organisational. Practical implications - The findings signal a caution for managers to assess the suitability of control type on knowledge transfer incentives to leverage quality knowledge outcomes. By using informal methods, subsidiary managers' local autonomy and power to resist centralised management objectives was positively moderated. Originality/value - The paper exposes alternative control methods for exploiting subsidiary knowledge within an MNE. The research is unique in that it identifies a superior role for bottom-up social control to elicit explicit knowledge sharing behaviours through ICT where bureaucratic reward-based control had failed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1367-3270,1758-7484,,,,,2014,18,6,,,,,1184,1197,,10.1108/JKM-04-2014-0160,,,,,,,WOS:000346110000007,,,,,

Sampling 18 ideologically diverse blogs (left-leaning, moderate, and right-leaning) across three public affairs issues in 2007, it was found that weak-tie connections enabled moderate blogs to bridge all ideological blog networks more comprehensibly and expansively than partisan blog networks. Unfortunately, the bridging effect of weak-tie connections provided less internal and external cohesion within the moderate blog network when compared to both partisan blog networks. Moderate blogs had low intragroup (within group) and intergroup (between group) cohesion: moderate blogs not only linked less internally but received fewer, reciprocal linkages from partisan blog networks.

This paper will first explain how came that we faced this question in the research department of our university, then tell the story of how we are answering it by means of a new kind of knowledge network called ""CoRe"" and finally reflect on lessons we are learning about weak ties cooperation. The Swiss Distance University of Applied Sciences is organized in a radically decentralized way combined with traditional hierarchical structures and functional divisions. This has led to an insufficient level of interactions between geographically distributed university members (academic staff, students) so that weak ties have become the norm. In research one major consequence was that research activities were too much isolated in the departments, human resources were dispersed and research knowledge did not flow enough. Projects were small and less recognised, know how got easily lost and research tools' development was too slow. How to meet the challenge of improving research performances under conditions of weak ties like these? Our approach consisted in a collaborative knowledge strategy: to create and cultivate CoRe, an intra-organizational knowledge network of researchers (academic staff, students) organized as a community of practice connecting its members around the common task of stewarding research knowledge. This paper provides first an overview of how we are designing, implementing and cultivating the CoRe knowledge network and then reflections on the new subject of weak ties cooperation as realized in CoRe. In the first part, after introducing the background of the CoRe project as well as our approach to knowledge cooperation we will present the development process and focus on the evolution of the network requirements by comparing the initial and a revised version. In both cases these requirements were collaboratively developed by the network members in two large events: a) the network launch, a future search event (June 2006) and b) the 1(st) Annual CoRe Conference (June 2007). Based on an analysis of the evolution between these two versions, in the second part our paper will provide reflections and key lessons learned about how to design and implement a collaborative knowledge strategy which is able to foster knowledge cooperation under conditions of weak ties. Here we will sketch the essential principles of our solution which consists in transferring to knowledge management lessons learned from bioteams thus building a bridge between Nature and Culture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-906638-10-8,,,,2008,,,,,,,59,66,,,,,,,,,WOS:000259556500008,,,,,

A growing body of evidence suggests not only that strong social capital contributes to diffusion of ICTs within a region, but also that uses of ICT help (re-)produce social capital stocks. This paper uses data from a 2008 Internet user survey in 12 European regions in order to gain insight into the relationship between Internet use and social capital.

Results of a national web survey (N = 1,005) indicate the use of Facebook groups for meeting new people relates to civic participation, along with added weak-tie discussions, which spill over to participation again indirectly. Sociability use of Facebook groups is also a source of bridging social capital, or having more active weak ties upon which to draw, and this contributes to trusting in people.

Design/methodology/approach Using a survey approach, data were collected from textile SMEs, located in Pakistan. Structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression model were run to validate the proposed model and the relationships. Findings Findings highlighted that strong tie and bridge tie of SMEs positively and significantly enhance the credit quality and SMEs' performance. Furthermore, information sharing significantly moderates the relationship between SC network ties and SMEs' credit quality.

Therefore, we conducted a quantitative 7-day diary study of 162 adolescent Facebook users attending German schools, looking at the impact of their daily SNS activities on their SWB.

It can be measured on the scale [0, 1] with 1 being assigned to fully convex networks. The largest convex component of a graph that emerges after the removal of the least number of edges is called a convex skeleton. It is basically a tree of cliques, which has been shown to have many interesting features. In this article the notions of convexity and convex skeletons in the context of scientific collaboration networks are discussed. More specifically, we analyze the co-authorship networks of Slovenian researchers in computer science, physics, sociology, mathematics, and economics and extract convex skeletons from them. We then compare these convex skeletons with the residual graphs (remainders) in terms of collaboration frequency distributions by various parameters such as the publication year and type, coauthors' birth year, status, gender, discipline, etc. We also show the top-ranked scientists by four basic centrality measures as calculated on the original networks and their skeletons and conclude that convex skeletons may help detect influential scholars that are hardly identifiable in the original collaboration network. As their inherent feature, convex skeletons retain the properties of collaboration networks. These include high-level structural properties but also the fact that the same authors are highlighted by centrality measures. Moreover, the most important ties and thus the most important collaborations are retained in the skeletons. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Integrating the emerging literature on social media and crowdfunding with the literature on social networks and public goods, we theorize that prosocially, public-oriented crowdfunding campaigns will benefit disproportionately from social media activity when advocates' social media networks exhibit greater levels of embeddedness. Drawing on a panel dataset that combines campaign fundraising activity associated with more than 1,000 campaigns on Kickstarter with campaign-related social media activity on Twitter, we construct network-level measures of embeddedness between and amongst individuals initiating the latter, in terms of transitivity and topological overlap. We demonstrate that Twitter activity drives a disproportionate increase in fundraising for prosocially oriented crowdfunding campaigns when posting users' networks exhibit greater embeddedness. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings, highlighting how our work extends prior research on the role of embeddedness in peer influence by demonstrating the joint roles of message features and network structure in the peer influence process. Our work suggests that when a transmitter's message is prosocial or cause-oriented, embeddedness will play a stronger role in determining influence.

The unique feature of repeat customer visits in the data allows us to examine observational learning in trials and repeats and to separate it from non-informational confounding mechanisms, such as homophily, using a novel test based on the empirical model. The empirical evidence supports a strong observational learning effect. We also find that the moderating role of the geographical locations of users and their friends on the magnitude of observational learning is critical. These findings suggest a nuanced view for local merchants to boost observational learning with the advancement of location-based technology.",,,,,"Qiu, Liangfei/0000-0002-8771-9389",,,,,,,,,,,,1047-7047,1526-5536,,,,DEC,2018,29,4,,,,,1044,1061,,10.1287/isre.2017.0769,,,,,,,WOS:000458521100015,,,,,

Key issues in understanding social media and such services include how to generate more information traffic and how to increase information exposure. Unlike previous studies in the research stream studying patterns of information diffusion, we investigate the role of influential Twitter users, focusing on their positions in social networks, in redistributing contents generated by other users. To do this, we employ sociological theories in determining which characteristics of connecting users provide more influence. Specifically, a connecting user's position in networks observable to audience affects the user's influence in a way that connecting users with relatively high status and those embedded in a closely connected community exert the greatest impact on the network. Moreover, the value of a connecting user's network position can be contingent on the source user's status and network position: a high-status connecting user contributes more to information diffusion when tweets are generated by a low-status source user, and a connecting user who is embedded in a well-connected network contributes more to information diffusion when tweets are generated by a source user in a brokerage position. After exploring data on tweets about Apple products and services, we find evidence that support this set of theoretical claims. Such findings would also provide a useful guidance for practitioners to enhance information diffusion by effectively designing the sequence of content recipients based on their network positions.",,,,"Lee, Ji-Hwan/C-1664-2011","Lee, Dongwon/0000-0003-4826-1632",,,,,,,,,,,,0095-0033,,,,,FEB,2018,49,1,,,,,13,31,,,,,,,,,WOS:000424262200003,,,,,

Understanding B2B social media communications,ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose - Social media communications on platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn can allow managers to interact cost effectively with trading partners. However, although most firms have an online presence on multiple social media platforms, the question remains as to whether marketers' widespread social media investments are beneficial for firms. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents competing hypotheses to explore how firms' investment in one form of social media impacts activity on another form of social media. To do so, the authors draw on a data set of 208 large Australian organizations using objective social media activity metrics that measure business-to-business (B2B) audience engagement. Findings - The findings suggest that widespread social media activity on LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube negatively affects a firm's marketing activity on Facebook. The results indicate that having a social media preference whereby firms focus on a specific social media platform is more effective in forming successful inter-organizational relationships than a multiplatform approach. Originality/value - The study contributes to the sparse research that seeks to leverage social media for audience engagement beyond a business-to-consumer context. The study's findings provide insights into the key mechanisms that underlie firms' B2B social media strategies, and in so doing, offer a fresh perspective on the importance of interactive marketing communication.",,,,"Gruner, Richard/L-6642-2019","Gruner, Richard/0000-0002-5176-8584",,,,,,,,,,,,1468-4527,1468-4535,,,,,2018,42,1,,,,,73,92,,10.1108/OIR-04-2016-0116,,,,,,,WOS:000419319800006,,,,,

A study of LinkedIn,ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose - Social network sites are emerging as a popular communication tool for knowledge sharing and construction. LinkedIn, which concentrates on professional networking, is reported to generate great informational benefits to its users. The purpose of this paper is to explore product users' knowledge construction in solving technical problems on LinkedIn, which was chosen as a case example. Design/methodology/approach - Discussion threads with rich knowledge elements were selected from an interest group about solving technical problems with laptops. Adopting a qualitative content analysis method, selected threads were analysed with a prior analysis framework built in the context of traditional IT company sponsored peer user support forums. Findings - The analysis revealed that the iterative and progressive knowledge construction process and associated trial-and-error strategy used on LinkedIn are similar to those found in peer support forums. However, LinkedIn members are more engaged in knowledge construction episodes. Meanwhile, the sub-category proposing a new idea accounts for a larger portion of discussions reflecting the high-level of expertise. One-to-one direct interaction is quite salient. Therefore, LinkedIn can support knowledge construction in a more efficient way due to the character of its social capital, including trust, sense of belonging, norms of cooperation, visible identity, knowledge articulation skills, one-to-one direct interaction and suitable strength of ties.

The proliferation of enterprise social media (ESM) and the associated increase in visibility of people, content, and interactions, has resulted in a widespread assumption that unlimited visibility improves boundary spanning. Consequently, the ESM literature has generally ignored the sentry functions of teams and failed to examine the possible strategic nature of visibility choices by ESM groups. Using log and content data from 655 ESM-based workgroups at a multinational enterprise, we contribute a deeper understanding of the distinct ways that ESM visibility-bounded or unbounded-is leveraged strategically to evoke diverse network structures, which in turn have implications for distinct boundary-spanning activities. Practically, these findings show that ESM present a unique opportunity for workgroups to simultaneously sustain multiple virtual spaces-with varying levels of visibility-through which they can manage their diverse boundary-spanning goals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0742-1222,1557-928X,,,,,2018,35,2,,,,,647,682,,10.1080/07421222.2018.1451961,,,,,,,WOS:000432280400011,,,,,

On the basis of panel data, we delve into the interplay among homophily, structural diversities across various online social networking services (SNSs), and users' homing preferences in such social platforms. The data feature of the SNS consumption behaviors of 10,172 individual users are obtained over a period of 134 days. An agent-based simulation model is developed to further validate and generalize the empirical findings. The simulation and empirical results consistently indicate that propensity toward homophily differs significantly across platform types and users' channel adoption behaviors. Online homophily is more pronounced in closed, private social networks than in open, public social networks. Users of asymmetric and symmetric SNSs exhibit weak and strong homophily, respectively. Moreover, whereas users who adopt a single SNS channel tend toward homophily, those who subscribe to multiple SNSs confirm the idea that ""opposites attract."" These findings suggest that users of online SNS channels manifest complex human interactions typified by the combination of homophily, heterophily, and asymmetric social preference, although homophily is the most prominent disposition.

Social media have changed the way we conceptualise the boundaries of space and time as well as how we interact with, exchange and respond to information. As a result, information behaviour is evolving alongside digital social media technologies. Increasingly, individuals and organisations are turning to social media to find as well as to disseminate information. This includes the homeless and underprivileged members of our societies. This paper reports on a case study of social media use, in the form of microblogging and blogging by an individual spanning a time of both homelessness and after obtaining housing. Method. The exploratory study used a case study approach along with information behaviour theories such as information grounds, information needs, and sensemaking as lenses to understand how the homeless use social media in their everyday lives. Analysis. The first phase analysed homelessness-related posts on Twitter over a period of two years, identified by following various hashtags and handles related to the topic. The second phase involved a content analysis of all blog posts by one individual identified through Twitter who also links to their own much longer blog posts during their time of homelessness. Results. Results show that social media provide an avenue for both social inclusion and social participation for the homeless while also helping them develop and maintain social ties and stave away their sense of alienation from society. Conclusion. Based on the findings, this paper argues that for those living on the margins of society, social media in the form of blogging and microblogging has potential not just as a source of information seeking and information sharing, but also as a medium that facilitates social participation, and helps create and sustain social ties, and even develop social capital, which in turn can help them overcome homelessness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1368-1613,,,,,DEC,2016,21,4,,,,,,,1610,,,,,,,,WOS:000394517200023,,,,,

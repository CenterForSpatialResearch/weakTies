Our review identified over 40 relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals from the mid-1990s to 2001, the take-off point for an increasing level of interest in neighborhood effects. Moving beyond traditional characteristics such as concentrated poverty, we evaluate the salience of social-interactional and institutional mechanisms hypothesized to account for neighborhood-level variations in a variety of phenomena (e.g., delinquency, violence, depression, high-risk behavior), especially among adolescents. We highlight neighborhood ties, social control, mutual trust, institutional resources, disorder, and routine activity patterns. We also discuss a set of thorny methodological problems that plague the study of neighborhood effects, with special attention to selection bias.

I review evidence consistent with the hypothesis, then look at the networks around managers in a large American electronics company. The organization is rife with structural holes, and brokerage has its expected correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations, promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the hands of people whose networks span structural holes.

Using existing theory and original fieldwork, I develop a framework to explain how embeddedness can influence which firms get capital and at what cost. I then statistically examine my claims using national data on small-business lending. At the level of dyadic ties, I find that firms that embed their commercial transactions with their lender in social attachments receive lower interest rates on loans. Ar the network level, firms are more likely to get loans and to receive lower interest rates on loans if their network of bank ties has a mix of embedded ties and arm S-length ties. These network effects arise because embedded ties motivate network partners to share private resources, while arm's-length ties facilitate access to public information on market prices and loan opportunities so that the benefits of different types of ties are optimized within one network.

Some of these action formations contain relatively small roles for formal brick and mortar organizations. Others involve well-established advocacy organizations, in hybrid relations with other organizations, using technologies that enable personalized public engagement. Both stand in contrast to the more familiar organizationally managed and brokered action conventionally associated with social movement and issue advocacy. This article examines the organizational dynamics that emerge when communication becomes a prominent part of organizational structure. It argues that understanding such variations in large-scale action networks requires distinguishing between at least two logics that may be in play: The familiar logic of collective action associated with high levels of organizational resources and the formation of collective identities, and the less familiar logic of connective action based on personalized content sharing across media networks. In the former, introducing digital media do not change the core dynamics of the action. In the case of the latter, they do. Building on these distinctions, the article presents three ideal types of large-scale action networks that are becoming prominent in the contentious politics of the contemporary era.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1369-118X,,,,,,2012,15,5,,,SI,,739,768,,10.1080/1369118X.2012.670661,,,,,,,WOS:000304470300008,,,,,

Evidence suggests that information about potential investment opportunities generally circulates within geographic and industry spaces. In turn, the circumscribed flow of information within these spaces contributes to the geographic- and industry-localization of VC investments. Empirical analyses demonstrate that the social networks in the VC community-built up through the industry's extensive use of syndicated investing-diffuse information across boundaries and therefore expand the spatial radius of exchange. Venture capitalists that build axial positions in the industry's coinvestment network invest more frequently in spatially distant companies.

In a 1988 survey in Tianjin, I find that (1) jobs are acquired through strong ties more frequently than through weak ties, (2) both direct and indirect ties are used to obtain help from job-assigning authorities, (3) job-seekers and their ultimate helpers are indirectly connected through intermediaries to whom both are strongly tied, and (4) job-seekers using indirect ties are more likely to obtain better jobs than those using direct ties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-1224,,,,,JUN,1997,62,3,,,,,366,385,,10.2307/2657311,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XG45300002,,,,,

High trust countries are characterized by ethnic homogeneity, Protestant religious traditions, good government, wealth (gross domestic product per capita), and income equality. This combination is most marked in the high trust Nordic countries but the same general pattern is found in the remaining 55 countries, albeit in a weaker form. Rural societies have comparatively low levels of generalized trust but large-scale urban societies do not. Cause and effect relations are impossible to specify exactly but ethnic homogeneity and Protestant traditions seem to have a direct impact on trust, and an indirect one through their consequences for good government, wealth and income equality.

These shortcomings are addressed by analyzing a unique, representative data set of organizational founding teams sampled from the U.S. population. Rather than simply considering the properties of those founding teams that are empirically observed, a novel quantitative methodology generates the distribution of all possible teams, based on combinations of individual and relational characteristics. This methodology permits the exploration of five mechanisms of group composition-those based on homophily. functionality, status expectations, network constraint, and ecological constraint. Findings suggest that homophily and network constraints based on strong ties have the most pronounced effect on group composition. Social isolation (i.e., exclusion from a group) is more likely to occur as a result of ecological constraints on the availability of similar alters in a locality than as a result of status-varying membership choices.",,,,"McBee, David J/F-3968-2012; Aldrich, Howard E/A-9835-2008","Aldrich, Howard E/0000-0003-2669-5536",,,,,,,,,,,,0003-1224,,,,,APR,2003,68,2,,,,,195,222,,10.2307/1519766,,,,,,,WOS:000222054000002,,,,,

The social organization strategy (SOS) framework presented in this article offers a complementary approach to social action in general and decision making in particular. This orientation, a network and event-centered counterpart to rational choice, rests on fundamental principles that distinguish the discipline of sociology: social interaction is the basis of social life, and social networks provide the mechanism (interaction) through which individuals learn about, come to understand, and attempt to handle difficulties. This approach shifts the focus from individual ""choice"" to socially constructed patterns of decisions, including consultation with others.

Social capital is an elusive concept and has been defined in various ways, and refers to sociability, social networks and social support, trust, reciprocity, and community and civic engagement. The paper contrasts three interpretations of the concept, by Coleman (1988, 1990), Putnam (1993, 1995) and Bourdieu (1986). It concludes that the concept is currently poorly specified as it relates to children, and that the use of the term is inherently problematic, and needs to be carefully critiqued and empirically grounded before it can usefully be applied in social policy formulations. One possible way forward might be to conceptualise social capital not so much as a measurable 'thing', rather as a set of processes and practices that are integral to the acquisition of other forms of 'capital' such as human capital and cultural capital (ie qualifications, skills, group memberships, etc).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-0261,,,,,NOV,1999,47,4,,,,,744,765,,10.1111/1467-954X.00194,,,,,,,WOS:000083793400005,,,,,

According to the theory, the probability that members will enter or leave the group depends upon the number and strength of social network ties that connect group members to each other and to nonmembers. We analyze an event history dataset constructed from interviews using Life History Calendar method and information on ego-centered social networks developed from the General Social Survey Network Module.

The author builds on Bourdieu ([1986] 2001) classic statement on the 'forms of capital"" (economic, social, and cultural) and the conversion dynamics among them, and on DiMaggio (1987) connection between cultural tastes and sociability. He hypothesizes that (1) in addition to cultural tastes being determined by network relations, cultural tastes are used to form and sustain those networks. Furthermore he expects that (2) highbrow culture taste will be less likely to be converted into social capital beyond immediate strong-tie circles due to its more restricted, ""asset-specific"" nature. Because of its generalized appeal, taste for popular culture will be more likely to be associated with weak-tie network density. The results broadly support these hypotheses: a model that specifies an effect of culture on network density provides a better fit to the data than the traditional conception of networks as determining taste. In addition using log-linear models and instrumental-variable methods, I show that popular culture consumption has a positive impact on weak-tie network density but not strong-tie network density, while highbrow culture consumption selectively increases strong-tie density but has no appreciable effect on weak ties, net of standard socioeconomic variables. These findings help to shed light on the mechanisms that translate mastery of different types of cultural knowledge into integration across distant social positions or closure around strong group boundaries. The author also discusses the implications of the results for current models describing the transformation of cultural into social resources.",,,,"Lizardo, Omar/A-5529-2008","Lizardo, Omar/0000-0002-5405-3007",,,,,,,,,,,,0003-1224,,,,,OCT,2006,71,5,,,,,778,807,,10.1177/000312240607100504,,,,,,,WOS:000241619400004,,,,,

A learning-theoretic specification imposes less stringent assumptions about the rationality of the actors and is much better suited to a structural analysis.

The theory asserts that frequent social exchange results in (1) positive emotions that solidify and strengthen the person-to-group bond and (2) uncertainty reduction that renders the focal group more salient in relation to others. These two mechanisms produce a sense of psychological group formation and ultimately increase observable acts of commitment. In a ""productive exchange"" setting, three actors negotiate a joint venture that requires the assent of all members. The exchanges featured two forms of commitment behavior: the giving of small token gifts and the decision to invest in a three-way prisoner's dilemma. The results suggest that positive emotion and uncertainty reduction are theoretically distinct and affect commitment behavior through different mechanisms.

In this paper, we propose two innovations. First, a new measurement method: the Resource Generator; an instrument with concretely worded items covering 'general' social capital in a population, which combines advantages of earlier techniques. Construction, use, and first empirical findings are discussed for a representative sample (N = 1004) of the Dutch population in 1999-2000. Second, we propose to investigate social capital by latent trait analysis, and we identify four separately accessed portions of social capital: prestige and education related social capital, political and financial skills social capital, personal skills social capital, and personal support social capital. This underlines that social capital measurement needs multiple measures, and cannot be reduced to one total measure of indirectly 'owned' resources. Constructing a theory-based Resource Generator is a challenge for different contexts of use, but also retrieves meaningful information when investigating the productivity and goal specificity of social capital.

We identify three benefits that forms of social capital may confer: information, influence and control, and social solidarity. In the context of a focus on benefits, we consider how a specific form of social capital may vary in the degree to which its benefits generalize to different kinds of goals, and how forms that are valuable for some purposes may be a liability for other purposes.

Exchange theory and most work in network analysis are based on similar conceptions of the actor. Where exchange theory and network analysis differ is in their view of the links between positions.

Instead, we find that for public schools, social closure among parents is negatively associated with achievement gains in mathematics, net of friendship density among students. This evidence of a negative effect of parental social closure within the public school sector lends support to our alternative hypothesis that horizon-expanding schools foster more learning than do norm-enforcing schools.

Examples are given in respect of informants' highly localized housing careers and their longer-term experience of 'poor work'. Paradoxically, though, while local networks helped in coping with the problems of growing up in poor neighbourhoods and generated a sense of inclusion, the sort of social capital embedded in them served simultaneously to close down opportunities and to limit the possibilities of escaping the conditions of social exclusion.

Most of our hypotheses are tested using a representative survey of Leipzig's population in the fall of 1990 that focuses on the 1989 protests. Among the incentives, only political discontent, weighted by perceived personal political influence, has a major impact on participation in the demonstrations. The expectation of repression was irrelevant. Opposition groups were unable to shape the incentives of the population, and incentives for their members to participate were weak, whereas negative incentives prevailed for members of the Socialist Party. Incentives to participate were concentrated in personal networks of friends. Thus, personal networks were the most important contexts for mobilizing citizens.

Prior research in a consulting firm revealed that respondents recognized five kinds of informational benefits when consulting others: solutions, meta-knowledge, problem reformulation, validation and legitimation. We employed these dimensions in a systematic network analysis of a different sample of people (human resource managers in a large conglomerate), using each of the five benefits as kinds of social relations. Two general research questions guided the analysis. First, how are these relations related to each other (multiplexity)? Do individuals obtain all of the benefits from the same individuals, or do they create balanced portfolios of complementary contacts that provide different benefits? Second. what properties and shapes do the networks induced by these relations form (structure)? What is the basis for who is tied to whom on each relation?? The fundamental result emerging from both research questions is that the five relations seem to form a unidimensional scale such that a contact who provides any given benefit is also very likely to provide all the benefits that are lower on the scale. Position on this scale seems to index underlying dimensions of social solidarity rather than individual attributes such as status. Consequently, relations at the end of the scale (e.g. legitimation) were more homophilous and proved to be strongly diagnostic of subgroup boundaries, a fact which could be quite useful in consulting or other applied contexts. This research contributes to the literature on knowledge management by revealing diverse ways that consulting others facilitates knowledge creation and utilization. The research also contributes to social network analysis by examining meanings and relationships among social relations, an area that is understudied. We found that the five benefits, treated as social relations, formed an entailment structure consistent with a Guttman scale. We also found that relations lower in the scale flowed smoothly across historical organizational boundaries whereas relations higher in the scale did not. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The initial premise is that markets are highly demanding arenas of social interaction, which can only operate if three inevitable coordination problems are resolved. I define these coordination problems as the value problem, the problem of competition and the cooperation problem. I argue that these problems can only be resolved based on stable reciprocal expectations on the part of market actors, which have their basis in the socio-structural, institutional and cultural embedding of markets. The sociology of markets aims to investigate how market action is structured by these macrostructures and to examine their dynamic processes of change. While the focus of economic sociology has been primarily on the stability of markets and the reproduction of firms, the conceptualization developed here brings change and profit motives more forcefully into the analysis.

Information flows between key agencies provide the basis for analyzing structures and linkages, allowing strategic weaknesses in the cohesiveness of the destination to be addressed by policy and management. The paper outlines four Australian case studies that demonstrate the utility of network analysis by illustrating features such as product clusters, structural divides, and central organizations.",,,,"Baggio, Rodolfo/D-5469-2014; Scott, Noel/B-3372-2010","Baggio, Rodolfo/0000-0001-9207-9665; Scott, Noel/0000-0001-8770-2563",,,,,,,,,,,,0160-7383,,,,,JAN,2008,35,1,,,,,169,188,,10.1016/j.annals.2007.07.004,,,,,,,WOS:000254140100009,,,,,
J,"WALDINGER, R",,,,"WALDINGER, R",,,THE OTHER SIDE OF EMBEDDEDNESS - A CASE-STUDY OF THE INTERPLAY OF ECONOMY AND ETHNICITY,ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES,,,,,,,,,,,,"As interest in ethnics and their entrepreneurial activities has grown in recent years, sociologists have come to emphasize the importance of ethnic social structures as the source of actions propelling business growth. In a sign of convergence with the 'new economic sociology', recent literature suggests that embeddedness in ethnic networks and communities leads to cooperative, if not conformist, behaviour among ethnic economic actors. This article looks at the 'other side' of embeddedness, through a case-study of African-American, Caribbean, Korean and white construction contractors in New York City. I argue that, in construction, the embeddedness of economic behaviour in ongoing social relations among a myriad of social actors impedes access to outsiders. Embeddedness contributes to the liabilities of newness that all neophytes encounter, breeding a preference for established players with track records. However, the convergence of economic and ethnic ties has a further baneful effect, since outsiders also fall outside those networks that define the industrial community, While African-American, Caribbean and Korean outsiders all experience these barriers in similar ways, they differ in the adaptive strategies that they have pursued. African Americans appear to be most disadvantaged, in part because they have been the most exposed to the social closure that results from the mobilization of white ethnics' social capital. By contrast, Caribbeans and Koreans entered the labour market in societies where racial domination played little or no role in labour market outcomes - a considerable asset since construction skills are transferable from one society to another. The Koreans appear to be the most embedded in ethnic networks, through which they secure jobs and skilled labour, though class factors play a role here as well and even the Koreans must reach out beyond the ethnic community for a clientele. By contrast, ethnic solidarity operates less powerfully among the black contractors, who are tied to a community where intra-ethnic diversity and internal competition have grown as a result of immigration. In the absence of an ethnic market, black entrepreneurs turn to the state, whose requirements and dependence on union labour expose black builders to risks from which their Korean counterparts are sheltered.",,,,,"Waldinger, Roger/0000-0003-0134-9928",,,,,,,,,,,,0141-9870,,,,,JUL,1995,18,3,,,,,555,580,,10.1080/01419870.1995.9993879,,,,,,,WOS:A1995RJ23900007,,,,,

In so doing, we examine the relationship between immigrants' reliance on social ties and their employment. Data collected through ethnographic depth interviews of Asian immigrants in Los Angeles indicate that reliance on social ties usually operates informally, as when job seekers consult their more experienced and better-connected friends, relatives, and acquaintances and ask them to serve as intermediaries. These networks provide group-based resources that assist immigrants in making headway in their new society. Yet reliance on social ties is most common for moves into jobs of low occupational prestige that have low human capital requirements. Because of linguistic and cultural competence, immigrants who seek jobs from coethnic employers are often more self-reliant in the job search than those who seek work more broadly. In this way, ethnolinguistic closure encourages ethnic segmentation in the labor market. By contrast, reliance on social ties, another form of closure, facilitates job hunting in the wider domain of the labor market, where prospective employers may be of any ethnicity. Reliance on social ties thereby provides a mechanism by which immigrants gain employment throughout the multiethnic metropolitan, labor market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0037-7732,1534-7605,,,,SEP,2002,81,1,,,,,281,314,,10.1353/sof.2002.0058,,,,,,,WOS:000179624500011,,,,,

It is hypothesized that under conditions of high uncertainty, bankers will rely on colleagues with whom they are strongly tied for advice on and support of their deals. Drawing on recent network theory, it is also hypothesized that transactions in which bankers use relatively sparse approval networks are more likely to successfully close than are transactions involving dense approval networks.

Finally only modest urban-rural differences in amounts exchanged (in dollars) are found among otherwise similar families.

(2) The association is consistent with the structural hole argument.

Where the personality index is associated with entrepreneurial networks (lower ranks), neither the index nor the networks are associated with manager performance.

Finally, two future directions are discussed: (1) to shed light on the paradox of persistent participation, and (2) to clarify how perceptions of sociopolitical context affects protest participation.",,,,"van Stekelenburg, Jacquelien/D-5508-2013","van Stekelenburg, Jacquelien/0000-0002-0064-3976",,,,,,,,,,,,0011-3921,,,,,SEP,2013,61,5-6,,,,,886,905,,10.1177/0011392113479314,,,,,,,WOS:000323208600018,,,,,

Social support and its relationship to material well-being is assessed in a sample of 632 former and current welfare recipients.

J,"Ryan, L",,,,"Ryan, Louise",,,Migrants' social networks and weak ties: accessing resources and constructing relationships post-migration,SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"Within migration studies literature there is a tendency to assume that migrants have ready access to kin and friendship networks which facilitate the migration and settling processes. Through tight bonds of trust and reciprocity, these networks are considered to be sources of social capital, providing a counter-balance to the disadvantages that migrants may encounter in the destination society. This paper argues that more attention is needed to the ways in which migrants access, maintain and construct different types of networks, in varied social locations, with diverse people. I suggest that the often simplistic dichotomy of bonding and bridging capital needs to be re-appraised and instead offer an alternative way of thinking about these social ties. The distinction between them tends to be understood on the basis of the ethnicity of the people involved-bonding involves close ties with 'people like us' while bridging involves links beyond 'group cleavages'. Insufficient attention has been paid to the actual resources flowing between these ties or the kinds of relationship developing between the actors involved. The nature of these social networks may be better understood by focusing on the relationship between the actors, their relative social location, and their available and realisable resources. Data from a qualitative study of Polish migrants in London is used to illustrate this approach.",,,,,"Ryan, Louise/0000-0003-1386-7212",,,,,,,,,,,,0038-0261,1467-954X,,,,NOV,2011,59,4,,,,,707,724,,10.1111/j.1467-954X.2011.02030.x,,,,,,,WOS:000296466400003,,,,,

Multivariate analyses find that, across a succession of jobs and over time, immigrants tend to drift away from the more informal ethnic economy of the metropolis, a move that leads to higher earnings. The use of ethnic ties to locate jobs also declines. The main attraction of participation in the ethnic economy is the opportunity for self-employment.

Until now, SWT has never been directly tested but treated instead as a surrogate for the relationship between an actor's network and labor market outcomes such as characteristics of a job obtained. The paper restates SWT as a proposition about the probability of getting a job as a function of within-actor differences in tie strength and tests it with data on hires carried out in one Russian city in 1998. In support of SWT the results show that a worker is more likely to get a job through one of her weak ties rather than strong ties. The advantages of weak ties lie in their abilities to provide timely access to non-redundant information and to influence employers directly. In contrast, strong ties are associated with indirect influence on employers through well-connected intermediaries. The estimates come from a within-worker-fixed-effect conditional logistic regression and thereby provide rare evidence of an association between information and influence transferred through social ties and labor market outcomes, independent of workers' individual characteristics.",,,,,"Yakubovich, Valery/0000-0001-7519-2578",,,,,,,,,,,,0003-1224,1939-8271,,,,JUN,2005,70,3,,,,,408,421,,10.1177/000312240507000303,,,,,,,WOS:000230529700003,,,,,

Differences in the social and political context are especially important for social and cultural participation and belonging.

Secondly, we show that people tend to talk about things that many would regard as unimportant, for example, cloning of headless frogs, eating less red meat, and so on. Given this, the connection between characteristics of discussion networks and achievement of instrumental ends - for example, getting a job or enhancing social support - is tenuous.

This dependency suggests that many substantive findings reported about, for example, gender differences in network composition might be an artifact of the data-collection instrument.

J,"Marin, A",,,,"Marin, A",,,Are respondents more likely to list alters with certain characteristics? Implications for name generator data,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Analyses of egocentric networks make the implicit assumption that the list of alters elicited by name generators is a complete list or representative sample of relevant alters. Based on the literature on free recall tasks and the organization of people in memory, I hypothesize that respondents presented with a name generator are more likely to name alters with whom they share stronger ties, alters who are more connected within the network, and alters with whom they interact in more settings. I conduct a survey that presents respondents with the GSS name generator and then prompts them to remember other relevant alters whom they have not yet listed. By comparing the alters elicited before and after prompts I find support for the first two hypotheses. I then go on to compare network-level measures calculated with the alters elicited by the name generator to the same measures calculated with data from all alters. These measures are not well correlated. Furthermore, the degree of underestimation of network size is related to the networks' mean closeness, density, and mean duration of relationships. Higher values on these variables result in more accurate estimation of network size. This suggests that measures of egocentric network properties based on data collected using a single name generator may have high levels of measurement error, possibly resulting in misestimation of how these network properties relate to other variables.

Each neighborhood is conceived as a possible site of interaction and corresponds to a subset of possible network ties. In this paper, we discuss hypotheses about the form of these neighborhoods, and we present two new and theoretically plausible ways in which neighborhood-based models for networks can be constructed. In the first, we introduce the notion of a setting structure, a directly hypothesized (or observed) set of exogenous constraints on possible neighborhood forms. In the second, we propose higher-order neighborhoods that are generated, in part, by the outcome of interactive network processes themselves. Applications of both approaches to model construction are presented, and the developments are considered within a general conceptual framework of locale for social networks. We show how assumptions about neighborhoods can be cast within a hierarchy of increasingly complex models; these models represent a progressively greater capacity for network processes to ""reach"" across a network through long cycles or semipaths. We argue that this class of models holds new promise for the development of empirically plausible models for networks and network-based processes.",,,,,"Robins, Garry/0000-0001-7538-5804; Pattison, Philippa/0000-0001-9626-2897",,,,,,,,,,,,0081-1750,,,,,,2002,32,,,,,,301,337,,10.1111/1467-9531.00119,,,,,,,WOS:000177930800013,,,,,

Poor blacks are less likely than other blacks and nonpoor whites to live with another adult, to have even one per son outside the household with whom they discuss important matters (a discussion partner), or to have a college-educated person in their discussion network. Higher neighborhood poverty reduces the size of the discussion network for whites and blacks and affects the probabilities of having any kind of social contacts.

In addition to documenting this basic association between contact density and mobility expectations, we demonstrate that the nature of this association differs considerably depending on the larger context for local patterns of interaction. We investigate three such contextual factors: the degree to which the work unit is oriented toward individual rather than collective incentives; the density of the overall pattern of interaction in the unit; and the extent to which brokerage strategies are legitimate.

This is due to tremendous difficulties in data acquisition of social systems. Massive multiplayer online games (MMOG) provide a fascinating new way of observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously socially interacting individuals engaged in virtual economic activities. We have compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players over a period of 3 years from a MMOG played by 300,000 people. This large-scale data set of a socio-economic unit contains all social and economic data from a single and coherent source. Players have to generate a virtual income through economic activities to 'survive' and are typically engaged in a multitude of social activities offered within the game. Our analysis of high-frequency log files focuses on three types of social networks, and tests a series of social-dynamics hypotheses. In particular we study the structure and dynamics of friend-, enemy- and communication networks. We find striking differences in topological structure between positive (friend) and negative (enemy) tie networks. All networks confirm the recently observed phenomenon of network densification. We propose two approximate social laws in communication networks, the first expressing betweenness centrality as the inverse square of the overlap, the second relating communication strength to the cube of the overlap. These empirical laws provide strong quantitative evidence for the Weak ties hypothesis of Granovetter. Further, the analysis of triad significance profiles validates well-established assertions from social balance theory. We find overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of complete (incomplete) triads in networks of positive ties, and vice versa for networks of negative ties. Empirical transition probabilities between triad classes provide evidence for triadic closure with extraordinarily high precision. For the first time we provide empirical results for large-scale networks of negative social ties. Whenever possible we compare our findings with data from non-virtual human groups and provide further evidence that online game communities serve as a valid model for a wide class of human societies. With this setup we demonstrate the feasibility for establishing a 'socio-economic laboratory' which allows to operate at levels of precision approaching those of the natural sciences.

Results show adjacency of gang turf and prior conflict between gangs are strong predictors of subsequent gang violence.

Theoretically, brokerage is one of a small number of mechanisms by which disconnected or isolated individuals (or groups) can interact economically, politically, and socially. Across substantive domains, we are particularly struck by a dual aspect of brokerage: On the one hand, brokerage has the capacity to ease social interaction, enhance economic activity, and facilitate political development. On the other hand, brokerage often breeds exploitation, the pursuit of personal profit, corruption, and the accumulation of power; through these and other processes, brokerage can exacerbate existing inequalities. In this review, we make the case for elevating the concept of brokerage to a more prominent place in the sociological canon.

The gender-specific effects of this life stage may accrue because childrearing places men and women in separate social worlds; childbearing and childrearing thus may be a crucial phase in the process by which gender differences are created and maintained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-1224,,,,,AUG,1997,62,4,,,,,509,520,,10.2307/2657423,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XQ25400001,,,,,
J,"Bankston, CL; Zhou, M",,,,"Bankston, CL; Zhou, M",,,Social capital as process: The meanings and problems of a theoretical metaphor,SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY,,,,,,,,,,,,"In this study, we suggest that the difficulty in defining, locating, and measuring social capital is at core a philosophical confusion of language, and not just a consequence of excessively wide application. The term ""capital"" refers to resources for investment. Financial capital consists of specific quantities of assets. Human capital, a metaphorical extension of financial capital, also consists of specific quantities of assets, in the form of skills or credentials. However, social capital, a third metaphorical construction, does not consist of resources that are held by individuals or by groups but of processes of social interaction leading to constructive outcomes. Therefore, we argue, social capital is not located at any one level of analysis: it emerges across levels of analysis. The confusion over the meaning of this term, then, is a consequence of a metaphorical confusion of a substantive quantity (capital) and a process that takes place through stages (embedded, goal-directed social relations). Locating and defining social capital is further complicated by the variability, contextuality, and conditionality of the process. Stages of social relations that lead to constructive outcomes for one group of people or in one situation may not lead to constructive outcomes for another group or in another situation. To illustrate empirically how social capital may be thought of as a process consisting of stages and to demonstrate why the concept is inherently problematic, we employ data from the 1995 inter-views of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). These data enable us to examine connections among the stages of the social capital process found in the literature and to look at predictors of academic achievement, a central topic in research on this topic.",,,,,"Zhou, Min/0000-0003-4692-7234",,,,,,,,,,,,0038-0245,,,,,SPR,2002,72,2,,,,,285,317,,10.1111/1475-682X.00017,,,,,,,WOS:000175378200006,,,,,

We explore more fully the role of community social capital in influencing educational performance beyond that attributed to family social capital.

In this case study we examine a neighborhood, the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, New York, in which there is a concentration of poor people living in close proximity to blue-collar jobs. However, few local residents hold local jobs in the private sector. A survey of local employers revealed that most Red Hook jobs were filled via social networks that exclude local residents. Local residents, particularly African Americans, often lacked the serial capital - connections and references - needed to obtain these jobs. Further, many local employers considered Red Hook residents undesirable employees for a variety of reasons including ''place discrimination'' as well as racial discrimination. By contrast, public sector employers often preferred local residents, although their ability to hire them was limited by formal educational requirements.

Methods. Using the 1999-2000 Lilly Survey of Attitudes and Social Networks, we conduct univariate and multivariate analyses to test our hypotheses. Results. Those who had experienced prior interracial contact in schools and neighborhoods were more likely, as adults, to have more racially diverse general social groups and friendship circles. They were more likely to attend multiracial as opposed to a uniracial religious congregations, and to be interracially married. In general, these findings applied not only to all Americans, but to whites, African Americans, and Hispanics separately. They did not apply to Asians. Conclusions.

The durability of Silicon Valley's innovative competence over the last seventy years also needs more explanation. The failure of several policy-makers around the world to reproduce the Silicon Valley cluster reveals the misunderstanding of the innovative dynamic in Silicon Valley. This study uses complex network theory - CNT (Barabasi, Newman Watts, 2006; Jen, 2006; Thompson, 2004a) to analyse the complex innovative capability of Silicon Valley and to understand the heterogeneity of agents and the multiplexity of ties that support creation and development of high-tech start-ups. As proposed by Barabasi (2002, p. 200), we view the economy as a complex network, whose nodes are companies and whose links represent the various economic and financial ties connecting them. Innovation and entrepreneurship are understood as resulting from the interactions of numerous economic agents. In a systemic perspective, by definition, the presence of a specific agent in a network induces specific interactions with other agents that could not take place if this agent were not there. Thus, the diversity of agents influences the dynamics of the system. The presence of venture capital (hereafter VC) firms in an innovative cluster opens potential specific interactions with other agents in the network (universities, large companies, laboratories) that determine a particular dynamic of innovation. In this perspective, what is distinctive about Silicon Valley is its complete and robust complex system of innovation supported by social networks of interdependent economic agents in which the VC firms have a specific function. Our perspective examines five different contributions of VC firms to Silicon Valley: financing, selection, collective learning, embedding and signalling. These five functions are different ways for the VC firms to interact with the other members of the complex network of innovation and to support the robustness of the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0308-5147,,,,,,2009,38,2,,,,,326,359,PII 911458915,10.1080/03085140902786827,,,,,,,WOS:000266245700006,,,,,

Specifically, firms run by central managers and directors were less susceptible to predatory takeover-ownership relationships dominated over ties among the business elite.

The evidence in favour of this view hitherto has been largely restricted to cross-sectional data that assess the degree of association between labour market position, poverty status and patterns of sociability. In this article we seek to test more rigorously the implied causal argument by exploring the relationship between these factors over time. The article first explores whether the transition from employment to unemployment heightens the risk of poverty and social isolation, and then turns to the issue of whether poverty and social isolation significantly affect the length of time it takes people to leave unemployment for a job. It draws on data from the European Community Household Panel, which provides longitudinal data for most of the EU member states, for the period 1994 to 1996. The article concludes that there is strong evidence that poverty contributes to a vicious circle of exclusion. Unemployment increases the risks of poverty and poverty in turn makes it more difficult for people to return to work. However, there is no clear support for the view that social isolation is directly caused by unemployment. Rather the risk of social isolation is contingent upon broader cultural patterns with respect to household structure and local sociability, which differ considerably between countries. Furthermore, there was no significant effect of any of the types of sociability studied on the time that it took people to re-enter employment.

To overcome these issues, this paper proposes redefinitions of the clustering coefficients for two-mode networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Recent research on employer hiring and worker search behavior has emphasized the importance of social ties in matching workers to job opportunities. There are mixed results in the empirical research, however, regarding the effects of informal search methods for minorities. In the present study we examine two questions: Do racial and ethnic groups vary in their job-search strategies! Do the effects of job-search strategies vary for racial and ethnic groups! Methods. Datal are drawn from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, which includes a random sample of households in Atlanta, Boston, and Los Angeles. Results. We find that Hispanics rely much more heavily on informal search strategies than do other race and ethnic groups, and that use of these informal strategies leads to lower-paying jobs. We also find that relying on a friend or relative to locate a job is especially detrimental for Hispanics and that using a multiplex tie (i.e., a person who is a friend or relative, a coworker, and a neighbor) leads to lower-paying jobs for Blacks and higher-paying jobs for Whites. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that a better understanding of racial and ethnic differences in search strategy results may require a more detailed examination of racial and ethnic differences in the kinds of jobs produced by informal searches and the types of employers who are more likely to use word-of-mouth recruitment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-4941,,,,,JUN,1999,80,2,,,,,263,278,,,,,,,,,WOS:000081305300004,,,,,
J,"Flap, H; Volker, B",,,,"Flap, H; Volker, B",,,Goal specific social capital and job satisfaction - Effects of different types of networks on instrumental and social aspects of work,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper addresses the question ""To what extent can job satisfaction be explained as the revenue of social capital?"" By conceiving someone's social network as social capital we specify conditions under which social ties do lead to job satisfaction. We inquire into the idea of goal specificity of social capital, which implies that a network with a given structure and content will have different impacts on various aspects of job satisfaction. If the content of the ties and the structure of the network at the job engender material well-being or produce social approval, satisfaction with the corresponding job aspects increases. Data were collected in 1993 using written questionnaires in two Dutch governmental agencies, one with 32 and the other with 44 employees. These workers' networks were charted using nine name-generating questions. Social capital, it turns out, is not an all-purpose good but one that is goal specific, even within a single domain of life such as work. Three effects stand out: First, the structure of the network and the content of the ties do matter. Networks of strategic, work-related ties promote an employee's satisfaction with instrumental aspects of the job, like income, security, and career opportunities. Second, closed networks of identity-based solidarity ties improve an employee's satisfaction with social aspects of the job, like the general social climate at work and cooperation with management and colleagues. Third, a network with a bow-tie structure (i.e., where a focal actor is the link between two or more mutually exclusive cliques) generally has strong negative effects on satisfaction with the social side of the job; although a bow-tie type network of trusting ties does increase satisfaction with the social side. This implies that Krackhardt's hypothesis on the unpleasant feelings produced by bow-tie type networks has to be specified for the content of the ties that constitute such a network. The most important conclusion of our analysis is that goal specificity of social capital has implications for both structure and content of social networks. Achievement of a particular goal, such as satisfaction at work, requires not only networks of a certain structure or ties with a particular content, but specifically structured networks of ties with a particular content.

We test a number of hypotheses drawn from the social networks and the rationalist perspectives on individual engagement by means of survey data on members of a major organization of the Swiss solidarity movement. Both perspectives find empirical support: the intensity of participation depends both on the embeddedness in social networks and on the individual perceptions of participation, that is, the evaluation of a number of cognitive parameters related to engagement. In particular, to be recruited by an activist and the perceived effectiveness of one's own potential contribution are the best predictors of differential participation. We specify the role of networks for social movements by looking at the nature and content of networks and by distinguishing between three basic functions of networks: structurally connecting prospective participants to an opportunity to participate, socializing them to a protest issue, and shaping their decision to become involved.

This article presents a set of propositions to understand how and why neighborhood institutions broker resources and applies these propositions to a case study of 16 childcare centers in high poverty neighborhoods in New York City. The author argues that resource brokers may be understood as interorganizationally networked, loosely coupled entities whose actors respond to pressures of multiple origins, including professional norms and state mandates. He shows that, through mechanisms that vary in their formality and staff dependence, childcare centers provide access to a remarkable array of resources from external organizations.

J,"Friedkin, NE",,,,"Friedkin, NE",,,Norm formation in social influence networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,,,,,,,,,,,"I propose a mechanism of norm formation and maintenance that combines classical theory in social psychology on attitudes and social comparisons with a formal network theory of social influence. Underlying the formation of norms is the ubiquitous belief that there is a correct response for every situation and an abiding interest for persons to base their responses on these correct foundations. Given such a belief, a normative evaluation of a feeling, thought or action is likely to arise when persons perceive that their positive or negative attitudinal evaluation is shared by one or more influential others. If interpersonal agreements validate attitudes and transform attitudes into norms, then the development of a theory of norm formation may draw on extant ""combinatorial"" theories of consensus production that describe how shared attitudes are produced and maintained in groups. The network theory of social influence that I employ is one such combinatorial approach. An important sociological implication of this network theory is that the content of norms must be consistent with the social stratification (or more general pattern of inequality) of interpersonal influences in a group. I illustrate the theory with an analysis of Roethlisberger and Dickson's (1939) classic observations on the Bank Wiring Observation Room. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The causal link between access to (for example, network resources) and use of (for example, contact resources) social resources is empirically tested in a series of models in which the effects of personal resources and social resources on status outcome are assessed. The analysis is based on a representative sample of employed males in a metropolitan area in upstate New York. Findings support the conceptualization of social resources as having two components. The analysis allows a further re-evaluation of the relative effects, bath direct and indirect, of the ascribed versus achieved statuses on status attainment.

Rather, social support comes uncertainly from a variety of ties in networks. This paper uses survey research to understand the variable and contingent nature of reciprocity and inquires about the kinds of resources exchanged between people. We investigate the extent to which interpersonal ties, network characteristics, and people's personal characteristics (e.g., gender) affect the nature of reciprocal relationships.

Then, we employ this framework and constructural theory to suggest that owing to cognitive inconsistencies, any interaction-based relationship, including friendship, can potentially be non-symmetric. We examine a series of hypotheses concerning interaction and interaction-based behaviors that derive from this theory using friendship relations. We find that we are able to predict both who is friends with whom, non-symmetry in friendship, and non-reciprocities in the expectation for and recall of friendship.",,,,,"Carley, Kathleen M./0000-0002-6356-0238",,,,,,,,,,,,0378-8733,,,,,JAN,1996,18,1,,,,,1,27,,10.1016/0378-8733(95)00252-9,,,,,,,WOS:A1996TL57800001,,,,,

We show that using social ties is a common job-search strategy in all countries. However, using social networks does not increase the monetary pay-off. Second, we use a sample of 8,000 Swiss university graduates who recently entered the labour market to show that informal job-search channels are beneficial with respect to important non-monetary job characteristics. Thus, graduates who received their jobs through social contacts tended to get jobs that are linked to their educational degree and offer better career perspectives.

Thus, we examine whether these changes are improving the ability of smallholders to innovate and thus improve their own welfare. In doing so, we analyze interactions between smallholders and other actors to provide new perspectives on the role played by smallholder innovation networks in the agricultural sector by drawing on data from community case studies conducted in 10 localities. Findings suggest that public extension and administration exert a strong influence over smallholder networks, potentially crowding out market-based and civil society actors, and thus limiting beneficial innovation processes. From a policy perspective, the findings suggest the need to further explore policies and programs that create more space for market and civil society to participate in smallholder innovation networks and improve welfare.

If network cohesion is enhanced by multiple connections between members of a group, for example, then the higher the global minimum of the number of independent paths that connect every pair of nodes in the network, the higher the social cohesion. The cohesiveness of a group is also measured by the extent to which it is not disconnected by removal of 1, 2, 3,..., k actors. Menger's Theorem proves that these two measures are equivalent. Within this graph theoretic framework, we evaluate various concepts of cohesion and establish the validity of a pair of related measures: 1. Connectivity-the minimum number k of its actors whose removal would not allow the group to remain connected or would reduce the group to but a single member-measures the social cohesion of a group at a general level. 2. Conditional density measures cohesion on a finer scale as a proportion of ties beyond that required for connectivity k over the number of ties that would force it to k + 1. Calibrated for successive values of k, these two measures combine into an aggregate measure of social cohesion, suitable for both small- and large-scale network studies. Using these measures to define the core of a new methodology of cohesive blocking, we offer hypotheses about the consequences of cohesive blocks for social groups and their members, and explore empirical examples that illustrate the significance, theoretical relevance, and predictiveness of cohesive blocking in a variety of substantively important applications in sociology.",,,,,"White, Douglas/0000-0002-0148-9392",,,,,,,,,,,,0081-1750,,,,,,2001,31,,,,,,305,359,,10.1111/0081-1750.00098,,,,,,,WOS:000173627000011,,,,,

Following authors from Leopold von Wiese and Norbert Elias to Gary Alan Fine and Harrison White, networks are configurations of social relationships interwoven with meaning. Social relationships as the basic building blocks of networks are conceived of as dynamic structures of reciprocal (but not necessarily symmetric) expectations between alter and ego. Through their transactions, alter and ego construct an idiosyncratic ""relationship culture"" comprising symbols, narratives, and relational identities. The coupling of social relationships to networks, too, is heavily laden with meaning. The symbolic construction of persons is one instance of this coupling. Another instance is the application of social categories (like race or gender), which both map and structure social networks. The conclusion offers an agenda for research on this ""meaning structure of social networks."".",,,,"Fuhse, Jan A/A-7854-2009","Fuhse, Jan/0000-0001-5183-9808",,,,,,,,,,,,0735-2751,1467-9558,,,,MAR,2009,27,1,,,,,51,73,,10.1111/j.1467-9558.2009.00338.x,,,,,,,WOS:000263361300003,,,,,

He felt that it would be a worthwhile exercise if I were to try to connect the ideas developed in Dasgupta (1993) with those in Putnam with Leonardi and Nanetti; hereafter referred to as Putnam (1993), to see whether the concept of social capital has potency for an understanding of the kinds of institution that are most likely to protect and promote human well-being in poor countries. This essay is about that, If the understanding I reached in my earlier work and also reach here is somewhat different from Putnam's, it may well be because I have been studying certain aspects of rural life in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent, while Putnam has been investigating the functioning of civil society in contemporary Italy (more recently, the United States; Putnam 1995). The point is not so much that the context matters; rather, it is that widening the set of contexts exposes the complexity of the idea of social capital and its efficacy.(1) A recurrent item on the agenda of social and political scientists has been to seek the most tolerable location for the boundary that separates the private and the public spheres of life, and to identify those agency roles, rights, expectations, and responsibilities that would define each sphere. It is not uncommon to view cultural differences in terms of the way different societies have ""solved"" this most critical of problems. But not all solutions have been effective in protecting and promoting human well-being. While an accumulation of social capital is necessary if the private and public spheres, no matter how they are conceived, are to flourish, it can also get in their way. The character of social capital matters greatly. In this essay I explore these complexities. Mary Douglas, Ira Katznelson, Dale Jorgenson, Paul Seabright, Ismail Serageldin, Giancarlo Spagnolo, and Gavin Wright commented on an earlier draft of the paper Over the years I have benefited greatly from discussions with them, and with Luca Anderlini, Kenneth Arrow Kaushik Basu, Carol Dasgupta, Paul David.

An exponential random graph model (ERGM) with structural dependencies is included for comparison. We fit models from each of these categories to two empirical acquaintance networks with respect to basic network properties. We compare higher order structures in the resulting networks with those in the data, with the aim of determining which models produce the most realistic network structure with respect to degree distributions, assortativity, clustering spectra, geodesic path distributions, and community structure (subgroups with dense internal connections). We find that the nodal attribute models successfully produce assortative networks and very clear community structure. However, they generate unrealistic clustering spectra and peaked degree distributions that do not match empirical data on large social networks. On the other hand, many of the network evolution models produce degree distributions and clustering spectra that agree more closely with data. They also generate assortative networks and community structure, although often not to the same extent as in the data.

This article examines the extent to which nonprofit organizational foundings are determined by various forms of social capital. Our hypothesis is that, controlling for other relevant social, political, and economic factors, communities with higher levels of social capital should experience more extensive growth in their nonprofit sectors. Methods. Using data derived from the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey and the IRS ""charitable organization"" Business Master Files, we test our hypothesis using a negative binomial event count regression on nonprofit organization foundings in 284 U.S. counties in the year 2001. Results. We find that two core dimensions of social capital-political engagement and ""bridging"" social ties-have a significant impact on county-level nonprofit foundings. Surprisingly, a key element of social capital in the literature, the level of interpersonal trust, does not lead to an increase in foundings of new not-for-profit organizations. Conclusions. This study provides further evidence of the strength of political engagement and bridging ties for the vitality of the community. It also shows that the different dimensions of social capital do not manifest a uniform effect on nonprofit sector growth. These results further demonstrate that the growth of a community's not-for-profit sector is dependent on a mix of ecological and environmental factors, especially preexisting organizational density, median household income, unemployment, and levels of governmental spending.

We test our hypotheses with structural equation models of drug-selling, theft and prostitution among a sample of homeless youth (N = 390).

These results remain when controls are introduced for home and school experiences, time af risk, situational adversity, and previous criminal experiences. Our analysis raises doubts about assertions that crimes are crudely impulsive acts that require little learning or skill and reflect a general imperviousness to others.

Using the case of Gujarati Indian migration to New York and London, the life histories of these immigrants illustrate that specific configurations of network ties result in different migration flows and occupational outcomes. These configurations include organizational, composite, and interpersonal ties that link local labour markets transnationally and channel immigrants to particular destinations and into particular occupations. The findings clarify the role and meaning of networks as they affect different types of migration and the occupational outcomes of migrants. The prominence of these network mechanisms also challenges the role of human capital in producing distinct outcomes for immigrants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1470-2266,1471-0374,,,,JUL,2001,1,3,,,,,243,259,,10.1111/1471-0374.00015,,,,,,,WOS:000209948800004,,,,,

Compared to those with smaller networks, those with large networks did not devote proportionally more time to communication and had on average weaker ties (as measured by time spent communicating). Further, there were not substantially different levels of disparity between individuals, in that mobile users tend to distribute their time very unevenly across their network, with a large proportion of calls going to a small number of individuals. Together, these results suggest that there are time constraints which limit tie strength in large personal networks, and that even high levels of mobile communication do not fundamentally alter the disparity of time allocation across networks.

Enough studies have now accumulated, however, to permit a more comprehensive assessment. The existing studies fall into three categories. The first two, which employ county-level data and victimization surveys, have encountered inconclusive and mixed results. By contrast, the 23 before-and-after comparisons in specific communities have been highly consistent: All but 2 of the 23 report greater increases in criminal activity than in population (p < .0001 by the sign test). The mean ratio of increased crime to increased population is over 4.4 to 1; regression analyses lead to more conservative ratios ranging as low as 3.2 to 1 and as high as 3.6 to 1. Despite considerable variations in approaches, methods, and study communities, sufficiently consistent findings show that simple regression equations explain 85-98 percent of the variance. The weight of the accumulated evidence indicates that increases in criminal behaviors are significantly more than proportional to increases in populations in rapid-growth communities. Data from other studies would argue against a generic ""social pathology"" hypothesis; instead, the accumulated findings may best be explained by narrowly focusing on changes in community social structure that accompany rapid growth and result in impairment of informal social controls, particularly the declines in a community's density of acquaintanceship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0036-0112,,,,,WIN,1991,56,4,,,,,619,645,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991HQ41300005,,,,,

Bridging is calculated by systematically deleting links and calculating the resultant changes in network cohesion (measured as the inverse average path length). The average change for each node's links provides an individual level measure of bridging. We also present a normalized version which controls for network size and a network-level bridging index. Bridging properties are demonstrated on hypothetical networks, empirical networks, and a set of 100 randomly generated networks to show how the bridging measure correlates with existing network measures such as degree, personal network density, constraint, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and vitality. Bridging and the accompanying methodology provide a family of new network measures useful for studying network structure, network dynamics, and network effects on substantive behavioral phenomenon.

In this paper, we use the Los Angeles Survey of Urban Inequality (LASUI) to examine the role of social networks on the constraints and opportunities which women face in labor force participation. We examine the effects of a woman's general network structure on her employment status, rather than focusing on the characteristics of the specific network tie that connected her to a job. Using an innovative, yet simple, measure to capture network diversity, we test network explanations of why women are in the paid labor force, controlling for background, structural, and family composition variables. In general, we find that the greater the quality and diversity of the social resources that are available through a woman's social network, the more likely she is to be working for pay. We also find evidence that suggests disadvantaged women with children must also rely on their social support networks for childcare to enter the labor market. In addition, we explore the connection between the methods successful job searchers used to find work and the overall structure of their networks through descriptive statistics.

The association between diversity and trust is better explained by differences between communities and their residents in terms of race/ethnicity, residential stability, and economic conditions; these classic indicators of inequality, not diversity, strongly and consistently predict self-reported trust.

However, the concept of ""social capital"" is unable to explain who benefits from social networks, to what degree, and under which circumstances. Based on an ethnography of Mexican and Central American undocumented immigrants in the Los Angeles janitorial industry, I argue that immigrant social networks may also become exploitative. Decentralized employment relations, hostile immigration and labor legislation, and a working-class community created a context in which recruitment through social networks facilitated restructuring. Within this context, benefits from the workers' networks accrued not to the workers themselves but to building owners. In this way, ties to family and friends constitute networks of exploitation rather than resource networks. This case suggests that more analytical attention be paid to how the benefits of social networks may change when the jobs themselves change. More broadly, it calls for attention to the contexts within which social networks become mechanisms for downgrading rather than platforms for upward mobility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0037-7791,1533-8533,,,,AUG,2005,52,3,,,,,379,397,,10.1525/sp.2005.52.3.379,,,,,,,WOS:000230910400004,,,,,

In this paper it is argued that people invest in relationships with certain others partly in order to solve these problems. Hence, the personal networks that result provide solutions to system-induced problems and they reflect the institutional environment. Personal networks of people living in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) during communism are examined, and social capital theory is used to explain why communism did not produce social integration. In a communist society like that of the former GDR, weak ties are a liability, not an asset. Therefore, GDR citizens trusted only people whom they knew well, Since people in the former GDR were acutely aware of political control and the damage potential of weak ties, they invested only cautiously in others. They kept their distance from strangers and all others whose trustworthiness was uncertain and discussed politics only with people whom they truly trusted (the 'niche'). Yet the shortages of the command economy forced people to rely on weak informal ties to secure necessary goods and services. Personal networks in East Germany had two specialized parts each kept separate from the other, a division of labor that vanished after the fall of the Wall. Our hypotheses are tested using multilevel models and triad analyses with data collected in 1992 and 1994 from two random samples in Leipzig and Dresden (n = 489). The first measurement focuses on the situation before the upheaval, the other the situation in 1994. Results show that during communism people indeed created 'niches' consisting of dense, small networks of close relations with similar and trustworthy others. Provision networks were maintained that were small, heterogeneous, and consisted of weak and uniplex ties. Furthermore, there was a relational 'gap' between the niche and the provision network.

Based on in-depth interviews and neighborhood observation, I find that it was the lower-income former public housing residents who were primarily involved in creating neighborhood-based social ties, providing and receiving social support, and enforcing social control within the neighborhood, rather than the higher-income newcomers. This variation in neighborhood engagement stemmed from the different ways that long-term and newer residents perceived and interpreted their neighborhood surroundings. These differences were generated by residents' comparisons of current and past neighborhood environments and by neighborhood reputations.

I argue that the existence and use of bridges in interpersonal networks also depends on individuals' health. Poor health may make it more difficult to withstand the pressures and to execute some of the common tasks associated with bridging(e.g., brokerage). I examine this possibility using egocentric network data on over 2500 older adults drawn from the recent National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). Multivariate regression analyses show that both cognitive and functional health are significantly positively associated with bridging, net of sociodemographic and life-course controls. The relationship between functional (kinesthetic) health and bridging appears to be partially mediated by network composition, as older adults who have poorer functional health also tend to have networks that are richer in strong ties. Several potential mediation mechanisms are discussed. Cognitive function remains significantly associated with bridging net of network composition, Suggesting that the inherent challenges of maintaining bridging positions may be more difficult to cope with for those who have cognitive impairments than for those who have functional impairments such as limited mobility. An alternative explanation is that cognitively impaired individuals have more difficulty recognizing (and thus strategically using) bridges in their networks.

Drawing on Granovetter's classic concept of weak ties, we argue that adolescent romantic partners are likely to be network bridges, or liaisons, connecting daters to new peer contexts that, in turn, promote changes in individual drinking behaviors and allow these behaviors to spread across peer networks. Using longitudinal data of 449 couples from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate Actor-Partner Interdependence Models and identify unique contributions of partners' drinking, friends' drinking, and friends-of-partners' drinking to daters' own future binge drinking and drinking frequency. Findings support the liaison hypothesis and suggest that friends-of-partners' drinking have net associations with adolescent drinking patterns. Moreover, the coefficient for friends-of-partners' drinking is larger than the coefficient for one's own peers and generally immune to prior selection.

J,"Britain, D",,,,"Britain, D",,,Dialect contact and phonological reallocation: ''Canadian raising'' in the English Fens,LANGUAGE IN SOCIETY,,,,,,,,,,,,"This article reports on research carried out in the Fens in Eastern England, a region noted in the dialectological literature as the site of a number of important phonological transitions, most notably [u - Lambda] and [a - a:], which separate northern and southern varieties of British English. Recordings of 81 speakers from across the Fens were analyzed for the use of (ai), a particularly salient local variable. A ''Canadian Raising'' type of allophonic variation was found in the central Fenland: speakers in this area used raised onsets of (ai) before voiceless consonants but open onsets before voiced consonants, morpheme boundaries, and /(sic)/. The article weighs a number of possible explanations for the emergence of this variation in the Fens.

In this article, we examine their economic marginalization in terms of status position. This research expands the explanation of economic marginalization of low-educated workers by scrutinizing additional causes, such as negative social selection, negative cognitive competence selection, and the increasing negative signal of being low educated (discredit). The results of the country comparison, using multilevel estimation techniques with inclusion of cross-level interactions, depict that, indeed, educational differences in socio-economic status attainment are larger in countries where the average competence of the group is low, the social composition is unfavourable, and the size of the low-educated group is relatively small.

Using in-depth interviews with entry-level white collar workers I show that information holders with opportunities to mention specific jobs to specific people do so only 27% of the time. Because they hesitate to share information if they are uncertain the information is specifically sought, information flows more commonly to strong ties, whose career goals are more likely to be known. Information is more likely to be shared with weak ties if it concerns occupations for which one may be specifically credentialed, since receiving relevant training serves as signal of interest in such jobs.

In this article, we explore leadership's influence on movement dynamics by examining Nigeria's Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), the Catholic Left-inspired Plowshares movement, the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, Mexico, and the liberation movement in El Salvador. Building on Bourdieu, Putnam, and the existing literature on social movement leadership, we argue that these movements' leaders possessed ""leadership capital"" having cultural, social, and symbolic components. We then turn our attention to the conditions under which leadership capital affects three key processes in movement development: mobilization of aggrieved parties, activation of third-party supporters, and responses to repression. We conclude by calling for more comprehensive, systematic, and comparative investigation of factors influencing leadership in domestic and transnational movements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1086-671X,,,,,FEB,2006,11,1,,,,,1,22,,,,,,,,,WOS:000239277500001,,,,,

Our key predictor from a theoretical viewpoint is the percentage of jobless males in the respondent's census tract. Controlling for various socioeconomic characteristics of the individual and family, we find that this factor has a strong effect in predicting the odds of various problematic socioeconomic outcomes. Young African American men who live in neighborhoods of concentrated male joblessness are significantly more likely to be jobless themselves. Likewise, black women who live in areas where jobless men predominate are considerably less likely to get married, but this factor does not affect the odds of teenage childbearing.

A survey of small and medium size firms in Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina is used to demonstrate how the level of trust entrepreneurs have in institutions and business partners influences the choice of governance mechanisms that coordinate economic activities among actors. The article shows that the institutional environment in Slovenia generates more trust, which enables actors to base their business relationships on trust rather than contract. In addition, when actors rely on trust it is usually institutional trust rather than interpersonal trust. In contrast, Bosnia, with a weaker institutional environment, generates less trust, leading actors to base their economic relationships on contract. However, when trust is used in Bosnia as a basis of business relationships it is likely to be centred on interpersonal trust. These results have important implications for the understanding of the process by which trust affects economic performance. The use of institutional trust as a basis for a governance mechanism may lead to increased economic performance of companies due to the inclusive nature of sociability patterns and tie formation since institutions generalize trust beyond a specific set of exchange partners. The use of interpersonal trust may limit economic potential due to its reliance on strong ties embedded within cohesive groups marked with closure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0268-5809,,,,,SEP,2005,20,3,,,,,371,391,,10.1177/0268580905055481,,,,,,,WOS:000231516300005,,,,,

The social world perspective provided the basis for exploring the nature of adult participation within a distinct social world-contract bridge. Results from a yearlong study of bridge groups in a town fictitiously named Glenn Valley revealed that bridge players used the terms social and serious as frames of reference in defining what constitutes legitimate bridge activity and in determining people with whom it is acceptable to play bridge. The use of these terms was pervasive enough to support the conclusion that the bridge scene in Glenn Valley is segmented into two distinct components: one composed largely of social groups and the other of serious groups. Social and serious groups are shown in this paper to differ in terms of recruitment processes, primary group functions, types of games played, social world linkages, physical settings and management of club activities, sequencing of bridge activity, topics of conversation, stakes, formation of partnerships, characteristics of club members, impersonal relationships, and types of substitutes.

I utilized data from the Latin American Migration Project (collected in 1998 and 1999) to test five hypotheses derived from social capital theory to predict the hourly earnings of Puerto Rican migrants. My study illustrates that Puerto Rican migrants' social capital is positively related with their earnings. Interestingly, the social capital effects only pertain to Puerto Rican females. Additionally, Puerto Rican migrants do not benefit from ethnic solidarity in terms of increased wages. My analyses point toward social capital's ability to provide important labor market information to Puerto Rican females, which they appear to use to acquire jobs paying higher wages. Social capital theory has been applied to many different phenomenon including banking, education, immigration, labor markets, and nation building (Massey et al. 1987; Coleman 1988; Uzzi 1999; Fernandez, Castilla, and Moore 2000; Putnam 2000). Within the labor market, social capital has been found to be related with earnings, employment, formal employment, and job tenure (Mier and Giloth 1986; Donato, Durand, and Massey 1992; Aguilera 1999; 2003; Philips and Massey 1999; Aguilera and Massey 2003). Within the immigration field, social capital has been linked with the migration process, labor market outcomes, and attainment of citizenship (Massey et al. 1987; Baker 2000; Aguilera and Massey 2003; Fussell 2004). Unfortunately, Puerto Ricans have been unstudied within this massive literature about social capital.

The results show that a chosen firm is most strongly influenced by comparable others when it faces scale-based competition and is diversified.

While on their own they are understood in great detail, the relation between them is rarely studied systematically. Are friendships outside of social groups more or less likely to be reciprocated than friendships embedded in a group? Using a theoretical framework that focusses on the situations in which friends interact and the social structures that stabilise one-sided friendships, I propose that the tendency towards reciprocation of friendships within transitive groups is usually lower than outside of transitive groups. In a meta-analysis of two datasets including 29 friendship networks using stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs), the interaction between reciprocity and transitivity is analysed. Supporting the theoretical reasoning, the interaction is consistently negative. Second, the tendency against forming three-cycles in friendship networks, which was consistently found in previous studies, is shown to be spurious and a result of neglecting to control for the tendency against reciprocation in transitive groups. The tendency against three-cycles is commonly seen as an indicator that unreciprocated friendships indicate local hierarchy differences between individuals; this proposition has to be re-evaluated in light of the findings of this study. Future studies that analyse the evolution of friendship networks should consider modelling reciprocation in transitive triplets and potentially omit modelling three-cycles. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These results show that, in neglecting the network structure of the world polity, previous research has underestimated the extent of structural inequality in the world polity.

Here I use empirical data to explore how these mechanisms influence cooperation in the natural laboratory of microcredit borrowing groups. Microcredit makes loans to high-risk borrowers through borrowing groups in which individuals' access to credit is dependent on the behavior of other members of the group, thereby creating a social dilemma for members and an opportunity to observe cooperation in real world groups. By analyzing both collective goods production (loans) and compliance (repayment), I find that the competing mechanisms have differential effects. Group identity, sanctions and reciprocity are all associated with more borrowing in the group. Only reciprocity, however limits loan delinquency and is associated with group longevity, suggesting both that collective goods production is a distinct process from group compliance over time, and that reciprocity may be an important mechanism in both processes.

We test these hypotheses in an analysis of inter-organizational contact-making in U.S. health politics, using the data of Laumann and Knoke (1987), with OLS regressions of average group contacts over lobbying events over time and maximum likelihood count models of contacts across interest groups. Both analyses show that as collective demand for information increases, interest groups place greater priority on establishing strong ties, even while controlling for organizational attributes such as budget, mobilization capacity and organization age.

While some researchers suggest that social capital increases with age and others argue the opposite, this study tests these contradictory assertions by analyzing multiple indicators of social capital from a nationally representative data set on working-age U.S. respondents. The findings reveal evidence of both social capital accumulation and decline. Social resources from occupational contacts tend to increase with age, but eventually level off among older respondents. Changes in voluntary memberships follow a similar pattern. However, daily social interaction is negatively associated with age. Overall, the results suggest that social capital embedded in occupational networks tends to accumulate across the career, even in the face of a general decline in sociability.

This article proposes a distinction between three meaningful variants within the concept of social capital for the purpose of an improved dialogue and a sharpened application. The differences between these three variants-relational, collective, and generalized social capital-are first illuminated through a conceptual discussion. An empirical analysis testing the linkages between relational and collective social capital is then provided in the context of a household disaster preparedness study in Dominica. Together, analytical and empirical evidence supports the idea that social capital covers a variety of interrelated, yet distinct, social processes that operate simultaneously and may serve different purposes. On the basis of these results, this article calls for a theoretically and empirically meaningful treatment of social capital in terms of its three variants. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We also ask whether these effects differ by gender. Our results show that using a contact with whom a job searcher shared membership in a fraternal/service organization decreased the probability that the searcher-contact tie was weak, but membership in these organizations and in church and recreational organizations increased the probability that the tie was gender homophilous. Both church and business voluntary organizational contexts had a positive effect on the use of a contact who was significantly older. Finally,for women, we find a negative effect of shared membership in school organizations on the probability that the searcher-contact tie was weak and,for men, a positive effect of business organizational context on the probability that the tie teas gender homophilous. We also find that voluntary organizational contexts exert indirect effects on search outcomes through these tie and contact characteristics, but these effects depend not only upon the type of voluntary organizational context and the gender of the searcher, but also upon the type of social resources through which the effects are exerted. We suggest that the structure of voluntary organizations may underlie these effects.

Do the initial mobilization advantages of social capital persist, however, as movement organizations evolve? And do the strategies pursued by social movement organizations affect these advantages? We investigate these questions through a broad empirical analysis of factors affecting the short-term persistence of local chapters of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). Reasoning that multiple forms of social capital would each have a positive impact on survival, we assess the independent effect of several indicators of social capital with mixed results. Consistent with prior research, we find that access to patronage at founding and a greater stock of weak ties in the community confer survival advantages. Yet SMOs that emerged from preexisting groups and those with leaders previously tied to one another through civic engagement were less likely to persist, raising a first cautionary flag about the generality of advantages of resource co-optation and ""bloc recruitment.""

Transferring constraint through price setting in the staffing sector,AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"This article analyzes how a broker ability to affect prices and extract superior value from its position has economic consequences for the actors tied to it. I argue that intermediaries may exercise partial control in price setting by transferring the price constraints imposed on them by the actors on one side of the market to those on the other side. In so doing, they generate unequal returns for the brokered parties, who then receive different prices due to the nature of the tie between the broker and its other exchange partners. I investigate this argument using a novel mix of quantitative and qualitative data gathered from an intermediary in the staffing sector The results show that the broker is able to transfer discounts offered to valued buyers (clients) on to the sellers (workers) matched with them, instead of reducing its own margins. As a result, actors with the same resource endowments receive different prices depending on the relationships among other exchange partners in a given triadic network of ties.

Using unique longitudinal personnel data on managers and their subordinates, this study identifies and tests for evidence of three distinct mechanisms by which managers potentially influence the assessment of employee performance in the workplace: (1) social network influence between employees' current and former managers; (2) manager-manager (horizontal) homophily; and (3) manager-employee (vertical) homophily. I find evidence of the independent effects of all three mechanisms of managerial influence on the outcome of disagreement in the performance evaluation ratings of the same worker between former and current managers. In particular, my results stress that both managerial network influence and horizontal homophily affect the process of employee performance assessments, over and above the well-studied vertical homophily mechanism.

We study the evolution of a social commerce network in a large online marketplace. Our dataset starts before the birth of the network (at which points shops were not linked to each other) and includes the birth of the network. The network under study exhibits a typical power-law degree distribution. We empirically compare a set of edge formation mechanisms (including preferential attachment and triadic closure) that may explain the emergence of this property. Our results suggest that the evolution of the network and the emergence of its power-law degree distribution are better explained by a network evolution mechanism that relies on vertex attributes that are not based on the structure of the network. Specifically, Our analysis suggests that the power-law degree distribution emerges because shops prefer to connect to shops with more diverse assortments, and assortment diversity follows a power-law distribution. Shops with more diverse assortments are more attractive to link to because they are more likely to bring traffic from consumers browsing the WWW. Therefore, our results also imply that social commerce networks should not be studied in isolation, but rather in the context of the broader network in which they are embedded (the WWW).

Rather, they are patterns of relations that emerge from individual and structural features of society, such as population composition, group heterogeneity, homophily, and social consolidation. Following Blau and Schwartz, the author develops a model of social network formation that explores how social and structural constraints on tie formation generate emergent social topologies and then explores the effectiveness of these social networks for the dynamics of social diffusion. Results show that, at one extreme, high levels of consolidation can create highly balkanized communities with poor integration of shared norms and practices. As suggested by Blau and Schwartz, reducing consolidation creates more crosscutting circles and significantly improves the dynamics of social diffusion across the population. However, the author finds that further reducing consolidation creates highly intersecting social networks that fail to support the widespread diffusion of norms and practices, indicating that successful social diffusion can depend on moderate to high levels of structural consolidation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9602,1537-5390,,,,MAR,2015,120,5,,,,,1295,1338,,10.1086/681275,,,,,,,WOS:000355348100001,26421341,,,,

Previous social network studies tend to treat the characteristics of social ties through which information is acquired as causes that may affect instrumental outcomes. However, little research has directly examined the spread of information via social ties and the tie effect on information dissemination. Using telephone survey data collected after the outbreak of an extensive commercial rumor in Hong Kong, the present paper investigates the characteristics of social ties through which the information is spread and the tie effect on information dissemination. Results show that while mass media, particularly television, serves as a major channel of information flow, social ties are also widely used. Individuals tend to share information with strong ties, or people with whom they perceive to have good relations. However, information transmitted via kin ties tends to arrive at the respondent faster than via nonkin ties or other communication channels. Implications of the findings are discussed.

For nearly thirty years, social network researchers have argued that the network is composed of ego's closest or most important alters. This assumption, however, has not been tested empirically. Using original data on an online representative quota survey of 2000 respondents, I find that 45% of the core discussion network is composed of people whom respondents do not consider important to them. In fact, the core discussion network includes doctors, co-workers, spiritual leaders, and other alters whom ego confides in without feeling emotionally attached to. I examine what respondents consider important matters and why they approach weak ties to discuss these. Placing emphasis on the process through which ego mobilizes alters, I develop two theoretical perspectives, which focus on how people identify those appropriate to a topic and how they respond to opportunities in interactional contexts. Findings suggest that ego discusses important matters with non-close alters at times because they are known to be knowledgeable (targeted mobilization) and at times because they are available when important issues arise (opportune mobilization). Results suggest that recent findings about changes in the core discussion network of Americans are consistent with several different possibilities about the nature of strong ties, including those in which there has been no change at all.

Collective identity and solidarity in the environment movement,BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Perhaps by virtue of its theoretical slipperiness, collective identity is often hailed as an important feature of social movements for the role it plays in unifying activists and organizations, and so helping them to develop shared concerns and engage in collective action. However, this paper argues that collective identity is the result of group rather than movement level processes, and although it can unite activists within a single movement organization, it is not always beneficial for the broader social movement. Although movements consist of networks of activists and organizations that have a broad shared concern, differing collective identities within the movement can actually be quite divisive. Based on case studies of three organizations in the environmental movement, this paper shows that activists who are most committed to an organization with an encompassing collective identity develop a strong sense of solidarity with other activists similarly committed to that organization. The resultant solidarity leads to the construction of a 'we-them' dichotomy between organizations within the same movement, increasing the chances of hostility between organizations and factions within the movement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-1315,1468-4446,,,,JUN,2008,59,2,,,,,227,253,,10.1111/j.1468-4446.2008.00191.x,,,,,,,WOS:000256117400003,18498593,,,,

Vertical differentiation, or variation in the ability of organizations of a particular kind to benefit from labor inputs, amplifies inequality through quality sorting, as the most productive employees in a particular domain pair with the most productive employers. Increasing horizontal differentiation-variation in the kinds of organizations-reduces inequality as individuals can more easily find firms interested in their distinctive attributes and talents. Our analysis of Danish census data provides support for each thesis. Increased numbers of organizations operating within an industry in a region, a proxy for vertical differentiation, increases wage dispersion in that industry-region. Variation in wages, however declines with increased horizontal differentiation among employers; this is measured by the diversity of industries offering employment within a region and the variance infirm sizes in an industry-region.",,,,"Sorenson, Olav/C-6926-2011","Sorenson, Olav/0000-0002-0599-6738",,,,,,,,,,,,0003-1224,,,,,OCT,2007,72,5,,,,,766,783,,10.1177/000312240707200506,,,,,,,WOS:000250181200006,,,,,

The article argues that the transition neither makes personal connections obsolete nor transforms them in a market-like fashion. In accordance with the path dependency argument, they persist strongly while formal labor market mechanisms are weakened by the devaluation of workers' formal credentials as a hiring criterion. The authors' theoretical propositions are supported by empirical analyses based on ethnographic and sun ey data collected in four Russian cities. Unstructured interviews indicate that the specific skills acquired by job candidates through the formal education system have a minor impact on hiring decisions. At the same time, personal connections preserve their influence and are being formally incorporated in decision-making. We treat the channels of help, channels of information and the formal market as alternative means of a getting a job described by a competing risk event history model with repeated events. The model confirms that the informal channels persist while the formal labor market is shrinking, although the relative increase in the value of personal contacts vis-a-vis the formal market is statistically insignificant. The shrinkage of the formal labor market becomes negligible when we control for the interaction of the educational credentials and the start of the reform period.

The neighbourhood's potential as a source of more inclusive and integrative social networks and wider solidarity is addressed. Influences on key sources of social capital - stability, integration, solidarity and tolerance - embrace issues of both structure and agency; relationships can be recursive. Neighbourhood variations in reciprocity and participation underline social capital's context specificity. Narratives suggest that the neighbourhood's potential for sustaining inclusive social ties, for social integration, tolerance, solidarity and 'thin' (as well as 'thick') trust is contingent on certain resources and conditions.

J,"Roberts, K",,,,"Roberts, K",,,Change and continuity in youth transitions in Eastern Europe: Lessons for Western sociology,SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper argues that the evidence from research among young people in post-communist countries vindicates and should consolidate confidence in the Western sociology of youth's conventional transitions paradigm which seeks links between social origins, routes and destinations. Contrary to claims about postmodern fluidity, individualisation, and a blurring of traditional structural boundaries, the expected links between origins, routes and destinations have persisted throughout the transformation of the former communist countries. The relevant evidence also confirms the primacy of education-to-work and family/housing life stage transitions. Other aspects of young people's lives - their uses of leisure, levels and patterns of social and political participation, and socio-political attitudes, for example - become meaningful and explicable only when set in the context of the routes that individuals' lives have taken, and the stages that they have reached, vis-a-vis their school-to-work and family and housing transitions. The paper proceeds to argue that the exceptionally thorough changes that are still in process in East-Central Europe and the former USSR reveal with exceptional clarity the processes whereby young people's life chances are structured in ways that are not of the individuals' own making. It has been, and it remains, possible to observe how young adults learn from their own youth life stage transition experiences and, where applicable, use the assets that they acquire or retain, to advantage their own children thereby structuring the opportunities that confront all members of subsequent cohorts of young people. Finally, it is argued that the sociological approach being advocated is uniquely able to use the evidence from young people as a window through which to identify the impact of the ongoing macro-changes in former communist countries among different socio-demographic groups in the wider populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-0261,1467-954X,,,,NOV,2003,51,4,,,,,484,505,,10.1111/j.1467-954X.2003.00432.x,,,,,,,WOS:000187416700003,,,,,

The research examines heterogeneity with respect to four sociodemographic variables: education, income, industry, and race. To correctly separate individual effects from structural effects, nonlinear hierarchical models are employed. The results from models separately including each type of heterogeneity provide support for the hypothesis. Estimates from a model including all four types of heterogeneity suggest that race heterogeneity has the strongest impact on affiliation, although the effect of education heterogeneity also remains.

Another approach assumes that choices are influenced by unintended outcomes that operate behind the backs of the actors. Considerable progress has been made in the past two years incorporating social structure and unintended consequences into formal models based on individual choice optimization.

Within and across marches, a small collection of ideas remains fixed in the national conversation, yet in a way that allows activists to address their internal diversity and respond to unfolding historical events. These results suggest that activists do not simply organize around their similarities but, through cultural anchors, they use their commonalities to build a thinly coherent foundation that can also support their differences.

In this theory, intended as a theory of large-scale networks, ties between nodes derive both from random and non-random events of connection. The non-random connections are postulated to arise through ""bias"" events that incorporate known or suspected systematic tendencies in tie formation, such as, mutuality or reciprocity, transitivity or closure in triads, and homophily-the overrepresentation of ties between persons who share important socio-demographic attributes like race/ethnicity or level of educational attainment. A key problem for biased net theory has been analytical intractability of the models. Formal derivations require approximation assumptions and model parameters have been difficult to estimate. The accuracy of the derived formulas and the estimated parameters has been difficult to assess. In this paper, we attempt to address long-standing issues in biased net models stemming from their analytical intractability. We first reformulate and clarify the definitions of basic biases. Second, we derive from first principles the triad distribution in a biased net, using two different analytical strategies to check our derivations. Third, we set out a pseudo-likelihood method for parameter estimation of key bias parameters and then check the accuracy of this relatively simple but approximate scheme against the results obtained from the triad distribution derivation.

However, network variables, especially network diversity, emerge as much better predictors of women's cultural participation than of men's. I conclude by suggesting that women may use cultural participation to draw symbolic boundaries against men as well as against women from other network structures.

Women move more slowly than men across the secondary-primary Job boundary in law academia, but neither choice nor structure, alone, accounts for women's slower rates of movement.

However, there is a growing divergence between how social capital is commonly measured in the study of ICTs and how it is measured in other fields. This departure raises questions about the validity of some of the most widely cited studies of social capital and ICTs. We compare the Internet Social Capital Scales (ISCS) developed by Williams [2006. On and off the 'net: scales for social capital in an online era.

Based on a survey of 880 undergraduate students (the population to which the ISCS has been most frequently administered), we find that, unlike structural measures, the ISCS does not distinguish between the distinct constructs of bonding and bridging social capital. The ISCS does not have convergent validity with structural measures of bonding or bridging social capital; it does not measure the same concept as structural measures. The ISCS conflates social capital with the related constructs of social support and attachment. The ISCS does not measure perceived or actual social capital. These findings raise concerns about the interpretations of existing studies of 'social capital' and ICTs that are based on the ISCS. Given the absence of measurement validity, we urge those studying social capital to abandon the ISCS in favor of alternative approaches.",,,,"Hampton, Keith/R-7031-2019","Kitzie, Vanessa/0000-0002-6499-9584",,,,,,,,,,,,1369-118X,1468-4462,,,,Apr 21,2014,17,4,,,SI,,398,416,,10.1080/1369118X.2014.884612,,,,,,,WOS:000333870700002,,,,,

Multivariate analysis of the Add Health data reveals that mentoring is positively related to the likelihood of full time employment, and the relationship involves both selection and causation processes. Entrance into the world of work facilitates the development of mentoring relationships, especially among youth who identify work-related mentors after adolescence. These relationships have the potential for promoting attachment to the labor force. Mentoring relationships that develop outside of work settings and during adolescence have a positive impact on the odds of full time employment. The receipt of guidance and advice from mentors, as well as access to weak-tied mentoring relationships, teacher mentors, and friend mentors all contribute to the increased odds of employment in young adulthood. However, adolescent mentoring may be less effective among young women than it is among young men. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The results show that women and men have similar-size networks.

Men's and women's networks contain a large proportion of kin overall. Most ties tend to be with immediate kin: children, parents and siblings. An immediate kin is usually the socially closest member of a network. Apart from voluntary factors, the importance of kinship ties in men's and women's networks may be the result of the macro-structural conditions under which patterns of social relationships take place.

We suggest in the line of political economy theory that traditional production factors cannot explain the observed differences. Rather, differences in the quality of formal institutions are crucial to economic wealth. However, this type of political economy theory accentuating the role of formal institutions cannot stand on its own. This implies a socio-economic approach in the study where we supplement the formal institutional thesis with Bourdieu's idea of material and non-material forms of capital. Such new socio-economics - which might be termed a ""Bourdieuconomics"" - implies the usage of a capital theory that, methodologically, operates with material and non-material forms of capital at the same level. Here, we stress the particular importance of a non-material form of capital, namely social capital, which facilitates informal human exchange, thereby ""lubricating"" civic society and the voluntary provision of collective goods such as trust and predictable behavior. In this way, social capital reduces transaction costs in society, thereby enhancing economic growth and the creation of differences in the wealth of nations. Future research should therefore be directed towards analyses of a new and formerly disregarded production factor, social capital, within a new field of socio-economics, namely ""Bourdieuconomics.""",,,,,"Svendsen, Gert Tinggaard/0000-0003-1463-5421; Svendsen, Gunnar Lind Haase/0000-0003-2989-2842",,,,,,,,,,,,0304-2421,,,,,DEC,2003,32,5-6,,,,,607,631,,10.1023/B:RYSO.0000004967.97783.c4,,,,,,,WOS:000186731100005,,,,,

Using data from the 20032005 National Survey of American Life (N=4,259) revealed that minimal race differences in family relationships fail to explain the race paradox in mental health.

The current study moves beyond prior research by constructing a measure of normative climate that more fully captures neighborhood norms, and analyzing the influence of normative climate on behavior in a longitudinal framework. Using recently geo-coded data from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study (TARS), we analyze the effect of normative climate on adolescents' sexual behaviors. Results indicate that variation in neighborhood normative climates increases adolescents' odds of sexual debut and casual sex, and is associated with their number of sex partners, even after accounting for neighborhood structural disadvantage and demographic risk factors.

    "Year": 2006,
    "Abs": "As distributed organizations increasingly rely on technological innovations to enhance organizational efficiency and competitiveness, interest in agile practices that enable adoption of information technology (IT) based innovations has grown. This study examines the influence of a network organization environment on the ability to develop agile adoption practices. An exploratory case study design was used to investigate the interactions between network structure, social information processing, organizational similarity (homophily), and absorptive capacity during the adoption of a large-scale IT system in two network organization environments within New York State. The data suggest that network organization characteristics and communication processes that reinforced social influence and supported knowledge transfer positively influenced adoption agility. We propose a model of agile adoption practices and discuss implications for the development of theory about network organization characteristics and capabilities to adopt IT-based innovations."

    "Year": 2006,
    "Abs": "We present a simple model for growing up and depletion of parties due to the permanent communication between the participants of the events. Because of the rapid exchange of information, everybody is able to evaluate its own and all other parties by means of the list of its friends. Therefore, the number of participants at different parties can be changed incessantly. Depending on the depth of the social contacts, which will be characterized by a parameter alpha, a stable distribution of party members emerges. At a critical alpha(c) an abrupt depletion of almost all parties is observed and as the consequence all the people are assembled at a single party. The model is based on a hierarchical social network. The probability that a certain person is contacted by another one depends on the social distance introduced within the network and homophily parameter alpha."

    "Year": 2007,
    "Abs": "Digital Green is a research project that seeks to disseminate targeted agricultural information to small and marginal farmers in India using digital video. The unique components of Digital Green are (1) a participatory process for content production, (2) a locally generated digital video database, (3) human-mediated instruction for dissemination and training, and (4) regimented sequencing to initiate a new community.Unlike some systems that expect information or communication technology alone to deliver useful knowledge to marginal farmers, Digital Green works with existing, people-based extension systems and aims to amplify their effectiveness. While video provides a point of focus, it is people and social dynamics that ultimately make Digital Green work. Local social networks are tapped to connect farmers with experts; the thrill of appearing \"on TV\" motivates farmers; and homophily is exploited to minimize the distance between teacher and learner.In a four-month trial involving 16 villages (1070 households), Digital Green was seen to increase adoption of certain agriculture practices by a factor of six to seven times over classical person-only agriculture extension. The hardware investment was a TV and a DVD-player per village, and one digital camera and PC shared among all 16 villages. These results are very preliminary, but promising."

    "Year": 2007,
    "Abs": "Evolution of altruistic behaviour in interacting individuals is accounted for by, for example, kin selection, direct reciprocity, spatially limited interaction and indirect reciprocity. Real social agents, particularly humans, often take actions based on similarity between themselves and others. Although tag-based indirect reciprocity in which altruism occurs exclusively among similar flocks is a natural expectation, its mechanism has not really been established. We propose a model of tag-based indirect reciprocity by assuming that each player may note strategies of others. We show that tag-based altruism can evolve to eradicate other strategies, including unconditional defectors for various initial strategy configurations and parameter sets. A prerequisite for altruism is that the strategy is sometimes, but not always, visible to others. Without visibility of strategies, policing does not take place and defection is optimal. With perfect visibility, what a player does is always witnessed by others and cooperation is optimal. In the intermediate regime, discriminators based on tag proximity, rather than mixture of generous players and defectors, are most likely to evolve. In this situation, altruism is realized based on homophily in which players are exclusively good to similar others."

It has been argued that trust can be viewed as an organizing principle (McEvily, Perrone, and Zaheer, 2003). However, we focus on the view that trust is an essential pre-condition for the sharing of knowledge. The goal of the paper is to discuss possible connections between social networking principles, network structure, and trust within Communities of Practice.In the paper we define and subsequently analyze the concept of trust and develop arguments relating to the existence and strength of trusting relationships within Communities of Practice. The theoretical arguments propose relationships between the characteristics of trusting relationships and two network characteristics: homophily and closure. The general research question that underpins this paper is:To what extent do network principles determine the level of trust among members within a Community of Practice?It is important to note that in our analysis we focus on a specific type of social network which has been termed a Community of Practice. Communities of Practice have been argued to be critical elements in the creation, refinement and sharing of knowledge (Dugid, 2005; Wenger, 1998; Wenger, McDermott, and Snyder, 2002)."

    "Year": 2008,
    "Abs": "Lau and Murnighan (LM) suggested that strong demographic faultlines threaten team cohesion and reduce consensus. However, it remains unclear which assumptions are exactly needed to derive faultline effects. We propose a formal computational model of the effects of faultlines that uses four elementary social mechanisms, social influence, rejection, homophily and heterophobia. We show that our model is consistent with the central hypotheses of LM's theory. We also find that negative effects of faultlines can be derived even when - unlike LM - we assume that initially there is no correlation between the demographic characteristics and the opinions of team members.

    "Year": 2008,
    "Abs": "Lau and Murnighan's faultline theory explains negative effects of demographic diversity on team performance as consequence of strong demographic faultlines. If demographic differences between group members are correlated across various dimensions, the team is likely to show a \"subgroup split\" that inhibits communication and effective collaboration between team members. Our paper proposes a rigorous formal and computational reconstruction of the theory. Our model integrates four elementary mechanisms of social interaction, homophily, heterophobia, social influence and rejection into a computational representation of the dynamics of both opinions and social relations in the team. Computational experiments demonstrate that the central claims of faultline theory are consistent with the model. We show furthermore that the model highlights a new structural condition that may give managers a handle to temper the negative effects of strong demographic faultlines. We call this condition the timing of contacts. Computational analyses reveal that negative effects of strong faultlines critically depend on who is when brought in contact with whom in the process of social interactions in the team. More specifically, we demonstrate that faultlines have hardly negative effects when teams are initially split into demographically homogeneous subteams that are merged only when a local consensus has developed."

    "Abs": "Despite the popularity of social network sites based on common interests, the association between these shared interests and relational development is not well understood. This manuscript reports results of an empirical investigation of interpersonal relationships on Last. fm, amusic-based social network site with a multinational user base. In addition to baseline descriptors of relational behavior, the chief goals of this study were to examine the degree to which Last. fm relationships are characterized by homophily (and particularly by shared musical taste), the extent to which communication via Last. fm is associated with other forms of communication (both offline and online), how such communication behavior is associated with demographic and relational characteristics, and whether these variables predict strength of relational development. Results indicate that although Last. fm relational partners exhibit shared musical taste, this shared taste is not associated with relational development. Rather, following media multiplexity theory, relational development is strongly and uniquely associated with communication behavior across almost all forms of communication (including Last. fm). These results suggest that shared interests may foster the creation of weak ties, but conversion of these connections to strong ties is relatively rare."

However, it is hard to maintain high quality of customer profile data because profile information is usually self-reported by users who do not always want to throw their profiles to the company. This paper presents a study of user profile reliability assessment using homophily in a large-scale mobile SMS (short messaging service) data. Our research provides a simple statistical method to find out users' true profiles based on profile information of users' neighbors in social network. Our dataset contains randomly selected 117,333 user data from a larg Korean mobile company, including users' demographic profiles and their text communication histories. Using the text network data, we construct social network. Results show that our method efficiently identifies users with great discrepancy between reported age and actual age. In particular, the prediction accuracy for a user's actual age by our method is 94.4% which is very high compared to 86.5%, the second best accuracy by the simple relational inference approach. The results imply that our age profile assessment model can verify whether a user's age profile is reliable or not and can be applied in practical use."

    "Year": 2009,
    "Abs": "Analysis of email networks reveals properties similar to classic social networks such as homophily (assortativity) and community formation. The technology underlying email enables the formation of a network but it does not explain characteristics of the network that occur only as a result of patterns in human social behavior. Accordingly, a network formed from email activity correlates to the social environment and the dynamics of the environment used to create the network. Furthermore, the overall social behavior observed in an organization may be attributed directly to the organization's strength and resilience. When an organization is in trouble, we observe social tension among its employees. That being the case, one should be able to discern this tension by examining properties of a social network of the employees-the network should reflect the employees' mood; the fears, worries, gossips that are circulating, the good and the bad, are all reflected in organization's social network. One of the best representations of the true social organizational social network can be constructed from email exchange. The issue we investigate in this paper relates to timing: when does the network exhibits social tension when it is known to be present in the organization? In this paper, we provide a temporal analysis of the email social network constructed for the Enron Corporation and show that changes in network characteristics strongly correlate to real-world events in that organization. More importantly, we show that this correlation is time-shifted and appears in the network before the event becomes common knowledge; our hypothesis is that we can use the anomalies in the network to identify social tension in the organization and consequently help mitigate its consequences."

    "Year": 2009,
    "Abs": "Purpose - The power of word of mouth (WOM) communication and its influence on consumer decision making is well established in academic literature. The recent adoption of online communication by many consumers has facilitated a fundamental change to the structure of many WOM interactions by exposing consumers to electronic WOM (eWOM) from virtual strangers. The current study seeks to uncover whether traditional findings on social ties and WOM communication hold for eWOM information.Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 482 college students with varying levels of expertise with eWOM forums, specifically RateMyProfessors.com in the USA. Participants completed a 20-question survey related to university professor and class choice.Findings - The study finds that students seeking information on which professor to take weight the information they obtain from eWOM forums to be equally influential in their decision as their own primary experience with the professor. Furthermore, the information gained from the eWOM forum is more influential in their decision than speaking with friends in person (WOM). While existing research suggests that strong tie referral sources are more influential than weak tie information sources on decision making, this research finds that some weak tie information sources are rated as more influential.Research limitations/implications - A limitation of the study is the focus on one eWOM forum, RateMyProfessors.com. Future research would benefit from expanding the number and type of eWOM forums.Originality/value - While the emergence of the Internet and social networking has spawned an interest in the overall study of eWOM, this study is the first to evaluate eWOM in the context of tie strength, homophily and decision making. The study also investigates whether existing theories of interpersonal communication hold in an online context."

Ubiquitous proximity e-service highlights the collective effort focused on collecting the user group's power as the reference for ubiquitous trust decisions.Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides some theoretical utility support for ubiquitous proximity e-service. The \"homophily\" describes the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others. By highlighting the \"homophily\" of e-service participants, these isolated individuals can be treated as a group with proximity. The main value of ubiquitous proximity e-service utilizes the network effect from the collective effort of interpersonal social network.Findings - In order to leap the trust barrier for users to embrace these ubiquitous e-services, ubiquitous proximity e-service makes it possible for users to collaborate with their nearby user groups to establish a reliable and trustworthy interaction environment. The simulation outcomes for trust decision quality enhancement show a significant improvement in a variety of environment settings.Practical implications - A significant value of ubiquitous proximity e-service lies in the increased possibility of establishing innovative social network relationships. From the interpersonal perspective, unfamiliar strangers can make connections with individuals who are proximal and homoplastic to them. The strength of proximity gives people better chances to make interpersonal connections, including both weak ties and strong ties. By combining those interpersonal tie relationships, ubiquitous proximity e-service can easily cause information diffusion and effectively encourage collective wisdom.Originality/value - The paper advocates the utility of ubiquitous proximity e-service that can be realized in the e-commerce environment and which enables information diffusion effectively."

    "Abs": "Social network sites like MySpace are increasingly important environments for expressing and maintaining interpersonal connections, but does online communication exacerbate or ameliorate the known tendency for offline friendships to form between similar people (homophily)? This article reports an exploratory study of the similarity between the reported attributes of pairs of active MySpace Friends based upon a systematic sample of 2,567 members joining on June 18, 2007 and Friends who commented on their profile. The results showed no evidence of gender homophily but significant evidence of homophily for ethnicity, religion, age, country, marital status, attitude towards children, sexual orientation, and reason for joining MySpace. There were also some imbalances: women and the young were disproportionately commenters, and commenters tended to have more Friends than commentees. Overall, it seems that although traditional sources of homophily are thriving in MySpace networks of active public connections, gender homophily has completely disappeared. Finally, the method used has wide potential for investigating and partially tracking homophily in society, providing early warning of socially divisive trends."

Founders choose cofounders with similar beliefs as themselves because they expect this to promote the most effective allocation of effort to the venture. Self-serving bias reinforces and perpetuates these beliefs.

Previous studies have shown that the link-formation process in such networks is Influenced by a set of facilitators. However, there have been few empirical evaluations to determine the important facilitators. In a research partnership with law enforcement agencies, we used dynamic social-network analysis methods to examine several plausible facilitators of co-offending relationships in a large-scale narcotics network consisting of individuals and vehicles. Multivariate Cox regression and a two-proportion z-test on cyclic and focal closures of the network showed that mutual acquaintance and vehicle affillations were significant facilitators for the network under study. We also found that homophily with respect to age, race, and gender were not good predictors of future link formation in these networks. Moreover, we examined the social causes and policy implications for the significance and insignificance of various facilitators including common jails on future co-offending. These findings provide Important Insights into the link-formation processes and the resilience of social networks. In addition, they can be used to aid In the prediction of future links. The methods described can also help in understanding the driving forces behind the formation and evolution of social networks facilitated by mobile and Web technologies."

    "Abs": "We address the following questions. Is there link homophily in the application layer traffic? If so, can it be used to accurately classify traffic in network trace data without relying on payloads or properties at the flow level? Our research shows that the answers to both of these questions are affirmative in real network trace data. Specifically, we define link homophily to be the tendency for flows with common IP hosts to have the same application (P2P, Web, etc.) compared to randomly selected flows. The presence of link homophily in trace data provides us with statistical dependencies between flows that share common IP hosts. We utilize these dependencies to classify application layer traffic without relying on payloads or properties at the flow level. In particular, we introduce a new statistical relational learning algorithm, called Neighboring Link Classifier with Relaxation Labeling (NLC+RL). Our algorithm has no training phase and does not require features to be constructed. All that it needs to start the classification process is traffic information on a small portion of the initial flows, which we refer to as seeds. In all our traces, NLC+RL achieves above 90% accuracy with less than 5% seed size; it is robust to errors in the seeds and various seed-selection biases; and it is able to accurately classify challenging traffic such as P2P with over 90% Precision and Recall."

We adopt multi relational classification that interconnects attribute based classifiers with iterative optimization based on relational heterogeneous graph structures, while different types of instances and various relation types can be classified together. We establish moderated class membership spreading mechanism in multi relational graphs and compare the impact of various levels of regulation in collective inference classifier. The experiments based on large-scale graphs originated in MAPEKUS research project data set (web portals of scientific libraries) demonstrate that moderated class-membership spreading significantly increases accuracy of the relational classifier (up to 10%) and protects instances with heterophilic neighborhood to be misclassified."

These findings have important implications for researchers and practitioners who need to understand social processes in MMOGs (e. g., when launching marketing campaigns in MMOGs) or who study MMOGs and then use their findings to draw conclusions about the real world (e. g., when analyzing the relationship between employee performance and network structure)."

This paper draws upon Social Network Analysis theory and utilises Lusher and Ackland's innovative 'Relational Hyperlink Analysis' to quantitatively explore significance and meaning in a conceptually defined internet mediated domain of local governance. This approach reveals a distinct homophily effect within the online 'congestion charge' network with local governance sites mainly hyperlinking to each other and websites hosting Web 2.0 technologies also more likely to only reference each other. The paper concludes that, in this instance, where civic and local government actors failed to engage each other online, use of the web as a space for local deliberation on the policy making process is very much work in progress. As a consequence the potential of a new, civic, 'architecture of participation' has yet to be fully exploited by civic leaders and activists."

    "Year": 2010,
    "Abs": "One of the key structural components of social systems is the social network. The representation of this network structure is key to providing a valid representation of the society under study. The social science concept of homophily provides a conceptual model of how social networks are formed and evolve over time. Previous work described the results of social simulation using a static homophily network. In order to gain the full benefit of modeling societies a representation of how the social network changes over time is required. This paper introduces the implementation of a dynamic homophily network, along with a case study exploring the sensitivity of model outputs to the parameters describing the network and applying social network change detection methods (SNCD) to model output."

    "Abs": "Quality of collective inference relational graph classifier depends on a.degree of homophily in a classified graph. If we increase homophily in the graph, the classifier would assign class-membership to the instances with reduced error rate. We propose to substitute traditionally used graph neighborhood method (based on direct neighborhood of vertex) with local graph ranking algorithm (activation spreading), which provides wider set of neighboring vertices and their weights. We demonstrate that our approach increases homophily in the graph by inferring optimal homophily distribution of a binary Simple Relational Classifier in an unweighted graph. We validate this ability also experimentally using the Social Network of the Slovak Companies dataset."

    "Abs": "This paper employs the network perspective to study patterns and structures of intra-organizational learning networks. The theoretical background draws from cognitive theories, theories of homophily and proximity, theories of social exchange, the theory of generalized exchange, small-worlds theory, and social process theory. The levels of analysis applied are actor, dyadic, triadic, and global. Confirmatory social network analysis (exponential random graph modeling) was employed for data analysis. Findings suggest: (1) central actors in the learning network are experienced and hold senior positions in the organizational hierarchy; (2) evidence of homophily (in terms of gender, tenure, and hierarchical level relations) and proximity (in terms of geographical and departmental distances) in learning relationships; (3) learning relationships are non-reciprocal; and (4) transitivity and high local clustering with sparse inter-cluster ties are significant for intra-organizational learning networks.

A study of 434 knowledge integration activities among 49 participants in four software development teams suggests that while search is directed both by homophily and by status differences among team participants, only status differences affect the perceived value of knowledge transfer activities. Further, the study indicates that there is not necessarily a correspondence between the status cues that direct search activities and the status cues that drive the perceived value of knowledge transfer activities among team participants.

Recently, the inclusion of social influence has proven to overcome them [A. Flache and M. W. Macy, e-print arXiv:0808.2710]. Here, we extend the Axelrod model with social influence interaction for the study of mass media effects through the inclusion of a superagent which acts over the whole system and has non-null overlap with each agent of the society. The dependence with different parameters as the initial social diversity, size effects, mass media strength, and noise is outlined. Our results might be relevant in several socioeconomic contexts and for the study of the emergence of collective behavior in complex social systems."

    "Abs": "A notable feature of U. S. social networks is their high degree of racial homogeneity, which is often attributed to racial homophily-the preference for associating with individuals of the same racial background. The authors unpack racial homogeneity using a theoretical framework that distinguishes between various tie formation mechanisms and their effects on the racial composition of networks, exponential random graph modeling that can disentangle these mechanisms empirically, and a rich new data set based on the Facebook pages of a cohort of college students. They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e. g., students from \"elite\" backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily."

In this article, we perform an in-depth longitudinal analysis of a relatively small network of scientific collaboration (N = 291) constructed from the bibliographic record of a research centerin the development and application of wireless and sensor network technologies. We perform a preliminary analysis of selected structural properties of the network, computing its range, configuration and topology. We then support our preliminary statistical analysis with an in-depth temporal investigation of the assortative mixing of selected node characteristics, unveiling the researchers' propensity to collaborate preferentially with others with a similar academic profile. Our qualitative analysis of mixing patterns offers clues as to the nature of the scientific community being modeled in relation to its organizational, disciplinary, institutional, and international arrangements of collaboration."

    "Abs": "It is often asserted that friends and acquaintances have more similar beliefs and attitudes than do strangers; yet empirical studies disagree over exactly how much diversity of opinion exists within local social networks and, relatedly, how much awareness individuals have of their neighbors' views. This article reports results from a network survey, conducted on the Facebook social networking platform, in which participants were asked about their own political attitudes, as well as their beliefs about their friends' attitudes. Although considerable attitude similarity exists among friends, the results show that friends disagree more than they think they do. In particular, friends are typically unaware of their disagreements, even when they say they discuss the topic, suggesting that discussion is not the primary means by which friends infer each other's views on particular issues. Rather, it appears that respondents infer opinions in part by relying on stereotypes of their friends and in part by projecting their own views. The resulting gap between real and perceived agreement may have implications for the dynamics of political polarization and theories of social influence in general."

The increasing availability of online social networks provides one approach to this problem: people linked in these networks often share preferences, allowing inference of interest in products based on knowledge of a consumer's network neighbors and their interests. This paper evaluates the benefits of inference from online social networks in two contexts: a random graph model and a web site allowing people to both express preferences and form distinct social and preference links. We determine conditions on network topology and preference correlations leading to extended clusters of people with similar interests. Knowledge of when such clusters occur improves the usefulness of social network-based inference for identifying products likely to interest consumers based on information from a few people in the network. Such estimates could help sellers design customized bundles of products and improve combinatorial auctions for complementary products. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We describe a novel application of pervasive computing based on using mobile phone sensors to measure and model the face-to-face interactions and subsequent opinion changes amongst undergraduates, during the 2008 US presidential election campaign. We find that self-reported political discussants have characteristic interaction patterns and can be predicted from sensor data. Mobile features can be used to estimate unique individual exposure to different opinions, and help discover surprising patterns of dynamic homophily related to external political events, such as election debates and election day. To our knowledge, this is the first time such dynamic homophily effects have been measured. Automatically estimated exposure explains individual opinions on election day. Finally, we report statistically significant differences in the daily activities of individuals that change political opinions versus those that do not, by modeling and discovering dominant activities using topic models. We find people who decrease their interest in politics are routinely exposed (face-to-face) to friends with little or no interest in politics."

    "Year": 2011,
    "Abs": "The notion of similarity is crucial to a number of tasks and methods in machine learning and data mining, including clustering and nearest neighbor classification. In many contexts, there is on the one hand a natural (but not necessarily optimal) similarity measure defined on the objects to be clustered or classified, but there is also information about which objects are linked together. This raises the question to what extent the information contained in the links can be used to obtain a more relevant similarity measure. Earlier research has already shown empirically that more accurate results can be obtained by including such link information, but it was not analyzed why this is the case. In this paper we provide such an analysis. We relate the extent to which improved results can be obtained to the notions of homophily in the network, transitivity of similarity, and content variability of objects. We explore this relationship using some randomly generated datasets, in which we vary the amount of homophily and content variability. The results show that within a fairly wide range of values for these parameters, the inclusion of link information in the similarity measure indeed yields improved results, as compared to computing the similarity of objects directly from their content."

To emphasize which types of virtual organizations can benefit most from a social network based approach, we give a classification of social network relationships.

Part of it is described by so-called protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and much effort is spent on analyzing these networks. In particular, there has been much interest in predicting certain properties of nodes in the network (in this case, proteins) from the other information in the network. In this paper, we are concerned with predicting a protein's functions. Many approaches to this problem exist. Among the approaches that predict a protein's functions purely from its environment in the network, many are based on the assumption that neighboring proteins tend to have the same functions. In this work we generalize this assumption: we assume that certain neighboring proteins tend to have \"collaborative\", but not necessarily the same, functions. We propose a few methods that work under this new assumption. These methods yield better results than those previously considered, with improvements in F-measure ranging from 3% to 17%. This shows that the commonly made assumption of homophily in the network (or \"guilt by association\"), while useful, is not necessarily the best one can make. The assumption of collaborativeness is a useful generalization of it; it is operational (one can easily define methods that rely on it) and can lead to better results."

In this paper we first apply their model to guilds in another MMOG (EQ2)(1) and found results inconsistent from the model's predictions, additionally we found support for the role of homophily in guild formation, which was ruled out in previous results, Alternatively, we explore alternative models for guild formation and evolution in MMOGs by modifying earlier models to account for the existence of previous relationships between people."

The specific classes of constraints include bounds on the number of calls in given spatial regions, specific homophily relations between callers and callees, and the indegree and outdegree distributions of the call graph, for the whole time duration and intervals. Our framework allows us to capture a variety of complex behavioral adaptations and study their impacts on the network traffic.

In this chapter, we propose a new paradigm of recommender systems which can significantly improve performance by utilizing information in social networks including user preference, item likability, and homophily. A probabilistic model, named SNRS, is developed to make personalized recommendations from such information. We extract data from a real online social network, and our analysis of this large dataset reveals that friends have a tendency to select the same items and give similar ratings. Experimental results from this dataset show that SNRS not only improves the prediction accuracy of recommender systems, but also remedies the data sparsity and cold-start issues inherent in collaborative filtering. Furthermore, we propose to improve the performance of SNRS by applying semantic filtering of social networks and validate its improvement via a class project experiment. In this experiment, we demonstrate how relevant friends can be selected for inference based on the semantics of friend relationships and finer-grained user ratings. Such technologies can be deployed by most content providers. Finally, we discuss two trust issues in recommender systems and show how SNRS can be extended to solve these problems."

We aim to model an item's socialness as a quantitative measure based on the how popular the item is adopted by members of multiple communities. We propose two socialness models, namely Basic and Mutual Dependency, to compute item socialness based on different sets of principles. In developing the Mutual Dependency Model, we demonstrate that items' socialness can be related to the socialness of communities. Our model have been evaluated on a set of users and application items from a mobile social network.

The key objective in establishing and running these online health communities is to offer empathic support to patients. Patients' perceived empathy is considered to be critical in patient recovery, specifically, by enhancing patient's compliance with treatment protocols and the pace of healing. Most online health communities are characterized by two main functions: informational support and social support. This study examines the relative impact of these two distinct functions that is, as an information seeking forum and as a social support forum on patients' perceived empathy in online health communities.Design This study tests the impact of two variables that reflect the above functions of online health communities information seeking effectiveness and perceived social support on perceived empathy. The model also incorporates the potential moderating effect of homophily on these relationships.Measurements A web-based survey was used to collect data from members of the online health communities provided by three major healthcare centers. A regression technique was used to analyze the data to test the hypotheses.Results The study finds that it is the information seeking effectiveness rather than the social support which affects patient's perceived empathy in online health communities run by HCOs. The results indicate that HCOs that provide online health communities for their patients need to focus more on developing tools that will make information seeking more effective and efficient."

The article also examines how hyperlink patterns began to change in 2005 and 2006 when Web 2.0 (blogs) was introduced. A key difference between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 was that the Assembly members were relatively well connected in the blogosphere. Furthermore, prominent Web 1.0 hubs with many links tended to disappear, but butterfly networks based on political homophily emerged.

    "Year": 2011,
    "Abs": "This paper investigates the role of homophily and focus constraint in shaping collaborative scientific research. First, homophily structures collaboration when scientists adhere to a norm of exclusivity in selecting similar partners at a higher rate than dissimilar ones. Two dimensions on which similarity between scientists can be assessed are their research specialties and status positions. Second, focus constraint shapes collaboration when connections among scientists depend on opportunities for social contact. Constraint comes in two forms, depending on whether it originates in institutional or geographic space. Institutional constraint refers to the tendency of scientists to select collaborators within rather than across institutional boundaries. Geographic constraint is the principle that, when collaborations span different institutions, they are more likely to involve scientists that are geographically co-located than dispersed. To study homophily and focus constraint, the paper will argue in favour of an idea of collaboration that moves beyond formal co-authorship to include also other forms of informal intellectual exchange that do not translate into the publication of joint work. A community-detection algorithm for formalising this perspective will be proposed and applied to the co-authorship network of the scientists that submitted to the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise in Business and Management in the UK. While results only partially support research-based homophily, they indicate that scientists use status positions for discriminating between potential partners by selecting collaborators from institutions with a rating similar to their own. Strong support is provided in favour of institutional and geographic constraints. Scientists tend to forge intra-institutional collaborations; yet, when they seek collaborators outside their own institutions, they tend to select those who are in geographic proximity. The implications of this analysis for tie creation in joint scientific endeavours are discussed."

Because homophily-the principle that like seeks like-has been suggested as a mechanism by which people interact, it may also provide a mechanism that generates such frequencies and distributions. However, our multi-agent simulation tool, Construct, suggests that a slight supplement to a knowledge homophily model-the inclusion of several highly salient personal facts that are infrequently shared-can more successfully lead to the tiering behavior often observed in human networks than a simplistic homophily model. Our findings imply that homophily on both general and personal facts is necessary in order to achieve realistic frequencies of interaction and distributions of interaction partners. Implications of the model are discussed, and recommendations are provided for simulation designers seeking to use homophily models to explain human interaction patterns."

Homophily-similarity of social contacts-can increase dyadic-level influence, but it can also force less healthy individuals to interact primarily with one another, thereby excluding them from interactions with healthier, more influential, early adopters. As a result, an important network-level effect of homophily is that the people who are most in need of a health innovation may be among the least likely to adopt it. Despite the importance of this thesis, confounding factors in observational data have made it difficult to test empirically. We report results from a controlled experimental study on the spread of a health innovation through fixed social networks in which the level of homophily was independently varied. We found that homophily significantly increased overall adoption of a new health behavior, especially among those most in need of it."

The goal of this paper is to develop an empirical approach for measuring information diffusion and discovery in online social networks that have these measurement challenges. We develop such an approach and apply it to data collected from 4,000 users of an online music community. We show that peers on such networks significantly increase music discovery. Moreover, we demonstrate how future research can use this method to measure information discovery and diffusion using data from other online social networks."

    "Abs": "Online social networking communities may exhibit highly complex and adaptive collective behaviors. Since emotions play such an important role in human decision making, how online networks modulate human collective mood states has become a matter of considerable interest. In spite of the increasing societal importance of online social networks, it is unknown whether assortative mixing of psychological states takes place in situations where social ties are mediated solely by online networking services in the absence of physical contact. Here, we show that the general happiness, or subjective well-being (SWB), of Twitter users, as measured from a 6-month record of their individual tweets, is indeed assortative across the Twitter social network. Our results imply that online social networks may be equally subject to the social mechanisms that cause assortative mixing in real social networks and that such assortative mixing takes place at the level of SWB. Given the increasing prevalence of online social networks, their propensity to connect users with similar levels of SWB may be an important factor in how positive and negative sentiments are maintained and spread through human society. Future research may focus on how event-specific mood states can propagate and influence user behavior in \"real life."

    "Abs": "While the focus of trust research has been mainly on defining and modeling various notions of social trust, less attention has been given to modeling opinion trust. When speaking of social trust mainly homophily (similarity) has been the most successful metric for learning trustworthy links, specially in social web applications such as collaborative filtering recommendation systems. While pure homophily such as Pearson coefficient correlation and its variations, have been favorable to finding taste distances between individuals based on their rated items, they are not necessarily useful in finding opinion distances between individuals discussing a trending topic, e. g. Arab spring. At the same time text mining techniques, such as vector-based techniques, are not capable of capturing important factors such as saliency or polarity which are possible with topical models for detecting, analyzing and suggesting aspects of people mentioning those tags or topics. Thus, in this paper we are proposing to model opinion distances using probabilistic information divergence as a metric for measuring the distances between people's opinion contributing to a discussion in a social network. To acquire feature sets from topics discussed in a discussion we use a very successful topic modeling technique, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We use the distributions resulting to model topics for generating social networks of group and individual users. Using a Twitter dataset we show that learned graphs exhibit properties of real-world like networks."

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "Location-based mobile applications such as Foursquare and Jiepang help bridge the gap between offline and online. People that we encounter and connect with around physical resources such as conferences, provide opportunities for extending our social networks from offline to online. We give a preliminary study on the relationship between the online and physical social networks in terms of the online and offline interactions (O2O) established during the conference, using a mobile social proximity-based platform called Find & Connect. We propose metrics of overlap fraction, network scale, and O2O transfer amount to quantify the O2O behavior of conference attendees. Our results demonstrate that more than half of the online interactions are included in the offline interaction network, and the offline to online transfer holds the dominant position in this bidirectional O2O transition between online and offline interaction networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the influence of offline to online, and vice versa, in a restricted environment using a social proximity-based system."

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "This paper studies the effects of peer influence and homophily on the diffusion of the iPhone 3G across a number of communities sampled from a large dataset from a major European Mobile carrier in one country. We use Stochastic Actor Based Models to capture the co-evolution of the social network as well as the dynamics of adoption. This helps to separate the roles of homophily and peer influence in the process of diffusion. We provide evidence that the propensity of a subscriber to adopt, when she is called upon to make a decision about whether she should adopt, increases with the number of friends that have already adopted. A one standard deviation increase above the mean in the number of friends that had already adopted increases the likelihood odds of adoption relative to no adoption by a factor of 2.8. The effect of peer influence is robust across a number of different specifications. The results for the effect of homophily are less clear. While, on average, we find a positive significant effect of adoption on tie formation, in many communities this effect is significant and negative and in others there is no effect at all."

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "Identification of social influence in observational data is a difficult task. Endogeneity issues such as homophily, correlated unobservables and simultaneity raise challenges to the researchers interested in establishing causality and in consistently measuring its magnitude. In this paper we apply randomization techniques to identify social influence in a mobile network setting. Randomization methods consist in generating pseudo-samples of the original data by selectively permuting the values of some variables among observations, and estimating empirical distributions of a parameter of interest under the null hypothesis that such permutations are random. We show that randomization methods are a viable strategy to identify social influence in contexts where all adoption is observed and the date of adoption is available. Furthermore, we show that these methods provide a lower bound for the magnitude of the effect of peer influence. We use a comprehensive panel of data from a large European mobile carrier in one country. The data comprise Call Detailed Records for all the subscribers in this carrier for a period of 11 months. We also have information on pricing plans, adoption of products, promotions and handsets. We estimate the effect of peer influence in six of these promotions. We provide evidence for negative peer influence in their adoption. Peer influence reduces adoption for these promotions between 3% and 9%. Peer influence helps to share information about new promotions but also signals who has already adopted them and, in many cases, such as free calls, having neighbors who adopted the promotion is enough to benefit from it."

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "This paper investigates a learning model in social networks with bounded confidence and uninformed agents. The neighboring relationships of agents are shaped by homophily in beliefs, which means any pair of agents are neighbors only if their belief difference is not larger than a positive constant, called bound of confidence. We consider two different kinds of agents: informed agents and uninformed agents, the essential difference between which is that informed agents are able to observe outside signals which can reflect the underlying true state. They update beliefs through Bayesian inference based on private signals plus consensus algorithm based on the beliefs of neighbors. Uninformed agents update their beliefs just by consensus algorithm without any inference. We find that the whole group can learn the true state only if the bound of confidence is larger than a positive threshold, which is related to the population density. Furthermore, we reveal that the larger the population density the smaller the proportion of informed agents needed to guide the group. By tuning the learning speed of informed agents, we find that the higher the speed, on the one hand, the shorter the time needed for the whole group to achieve steady state, but on the other hand, the lower the proportion of agents with successful learning, which is a trade-off."

Each individual updates her belief through Bayesian inference based on her private signal plus consensus algorithm based on the beliefs of her neighbors. We find that the whole group can learning the true state only if the bound of confidence is larger than a positive threshold, which implies that people should try to communicate with others whose beliefs are quite different with themselves, in addition to those similar to themselves. Furthermore, we introduce a neighborhood-preserved strategy to guarantee that once two individuals are neighbors they will be neighbors forever. We show that social learning in the revised model can be realized with much smaller threshold, and therefore, provide an effective mechanism for social learning."

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "Disentangling the effects of selection and influence is one of social science's greatest unsolved puzzles: Do people befriend others who are similar to them, or do they become more similar to their friends over time? Recent advances in stochastic actor-based modeling, combined with self-reported data on a popular online social network site, allow us to address this question with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore been possible. Using data on the Facebook activity of a cohort of college students over 4 years, we find that students who share certain tastes in music and in movies, but not in books, are significantly likely to befriend one another. Meanwhile, we find little evidence for the diffusion of tastes among Facebook friends-except for tastes in classical/jazz music. These findings shed light on the mechanisms responsible for observed network homogeneity; provide a statistically rigorous assessment of the coevolution of cultural tastes and social relationships; and suggest important qualifications to our understanding of both homophily and contagion as generic social processes."

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "The fact that similarity breeds connections, the principle of homophily, has been well-studied in existing sociology literature. Several studies have observed this phenomenon by conducting surveys on human subjects. These studies have concluded that new ties are formed between similar individuals. This phenomenon has been used to explain several socio-psychological concepts such as, segregation, community development, social mobility, etc. However, due to the nature of these studies and limitations because of involvement of human subjects, conclusions from these studies are not easily extensible in online social media. Social media, which is becoming the infinite space for interactions, has exceeded all the expectations in terms of growth, for reasons beyond human mind. New ties are formed in social media in the same way that they emerge in real-world. However, given the differences between real world and online social media, do the same factors that govern the construction of new ties in real world also govern the construction of new ties in social media? In other words, does homophily exist in social media? In this article, we study this extremely significant question. We propose a systematic approach by studying three online social media sites, BlogCatalog, Last.fm, and LiveJournal and report our findings along with some interesting observations. The results indicate that the influence of interest-based homophily is not a very strong leading factor for constructing new ties specifically in the three social media sites with implications to strategic advertising, recommendations, and promoting applications at large."

    "Title": "A graph-based action network framework to identify prestigious members through member's prestige evolution",
    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "Prestigious members on social networking websites are attracting increasing attentions from peers and corporations. People are used to consulting prestigious members for useful information and corporations are seeking opportunities to leverage them for \"word of mouth\" advertising. Identification and recognition of these prestigious members have been a crucial issue. Besides, the dynamic nature of members' behaviour determines the evolving nature of members' prestige. With the evolution of members' behaviour, currently prestigious members may be substituted by others who are not prestigious at present. The prediction of members' prestige evolution will help discover potential prestigious members, which will then help both people and corporations move to secure their long-term interests. However, little work has been done in relation to prediction of prestigious members. This paper aims to fill this gap specially using Flickr groups as a testbed. By investigating social actions among members, a graph-based action network framework to predict evolution of prestigious members has been proposed. Based on the social structural theory, which points out the interactive effect between social structure and users' actions, a favor action network that captures the social actions of choosing favourite photos of members is constructed. According to the network theory, properties of the nodes in the favor action network are investigated to identify currently prestigious members, and structural properties underlying the favor action network are mined to analyze the communication behaviour of members in a group. Further, the sociological theory inspires four key factors that affect members' favor action intentions, which are homophily, triadic interaction rule, continuity and recency. Based on the above analysis, a hybrid algorithm taking all these four factors into account is proposed to predict members' prestige evolution. Finally, several comprehensive and systematic analyses are designed and conducted to evaluate each of the functional components of the proposed framework. Results of evaluation on a real-world dataset validate its performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

PL and F2F recruited online youth (OY) to participate in MySpace and Facebook communities where digital media was disseminated and discussed. The resulting social networks were assessed with respect to size, growth, density, relative centrality of positions and homophily of ties. Seven PL, 53 F2F and 103 OY created two large networks. After the first 50 F2F youth participated, online networks entered a rapid growth phase. OY were among the most central youth in these networks. Younger aged persons and females were disproportionately connected to like youth. The program appears highly acceptable to homeless youth. Social network analysis revealed which PL were the most critical to the program and which types of participants (younger youth and females) may require additional outreach efforts in the future."

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "Social networks are not static but, rather, constantly evolve in time. One of the elements thought to drive the evolution of social network structure is homophily-the need for individuals to connect with others who are similar to them. In this paper, we study how the spread of a new opinion, idea, or behavior on such a homophily-driven social network is affected by the changing network structure. In particular, using simulations, we study a variant of the Axelrod model on a network with a homophily-driven rewiring rule imposed. First, we find that the presence of rewiring within the network, in general, impedes the reaching of consensus in opinion, as the time to reach consensus diverges exponentially with network size N. We then investigate whether the introduction of committed individuals who are rigid in their opinion on a particular issue can speed up the convergence to consensus on that issue. We demonstrate that as committed agents are added, beyond a critical value of the committed fraction, the consensus time growth becomes logarithmic in network size N. Furthermore, we show that slight changes in the interaction rule can produce strikingly different results in the scaling behavior of consensus time, T-c. However, the benefit gained by introducing committed agents is qualitatively preserved across all the interaction rules we consider."

We follow Peter Blau, Miller McPherson, Lynn Smith-Lovin, Duncan Watts and many others in positing that human behavior is best understood in terms of the complex social systems within which actions are taken, and that the representation of these social systems must make evident the endogenous structural constraints on opportunities for interpersonal contact and group affiliation. We further demonstrate that the ability to seed social simulations with representative social data about the society being modeled (e.g. from social surveys), and the use of social networks generated using principles of homophily from empirical social science, provide a compelling and actionable framework for both interpreting with and theory building from whole society simulations."

    "Abs": "Social media have attracted considerable attention because their open-ended nature allows users to create lightweight semantic scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay of the social and topical components of social media has been only partially explored. Here, we study the presence of homophily in three systems that combine tagging social media with online social networks. We find a substantial level of topical similarity among users who are close to each other in the social network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local similarity between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that users with similar interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore topical similarity measures among users based solely on their annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this hypothesis on several datasets, confirming that social networks constructed from topical similarity capture actual friendship accurately. When combined with topological features, topical similarity achieves a link prediction accuracy of about 92%."

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "Successful development of open source software (OSS) projects requires a steady supply of self motivated software developers. Thus a large body of OSS studies focuses on studying the developers' participation motivations. One important motivation is an OSS developer's desire to gain good community reputation which is largely based on positive evaluations from his peers. Therefore, to better motivate developers' project participations through their reputation needs, our empirical analysis adopted a social network perspective to study what factors may affect a developer's decision to positively evaluate one other in a large online open source community called Ohloh. The results surprisingly show that a developer's positive evaluation decision does not depend on his evaluatee's level of OSS-related experience, but rather based on 1) his past reputation (i.e.existing number of positive evaluations), 2) their shared affiliations such as mutual acquaintances, as well as 3) their homophily in location (city), nationality, programming language preference, and community status. We then discuss these findings and their implications for inducing more positive evaluations and better reputation management among open source project members. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first research that investigates issues of reputation building and relationship management in an open source development context.

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "Recent studies suggest that obesity may be \"contagious\" between individuals in social networks. Social contagion (influence), however, may not be identifiable using traditional statistical approaches because they cannot distinguish contagion from homophily (the propensity for individuals to select friends who are similar to themselves) or from shared environmental influences. In this paper, we apply the stochastic actor-based model (SABM) framework developed by Snijders and colleagues to data on adolescent body mass index (BMI), screen time, and playing active sports. Our primary hypothesis was that social influences on adolescent body size and related behaviors are independent of friend selection. Employing the SABM, we simultaneously modeled network dynamics (friendship selection based on homophily and structural characteristics of the network) and social influence. We focused on the 2 largest schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and held the school environment constant by examining the 2 school networks separately (N = 624 and 1151). Results show support in both schools for homophily on BMI, but also for social influence on BMI. There was no evidence of homophily on screen time in either school, while only one of the schools showed homophily on playing active sports. There was, however, evidence of social influence on screen time in one of the schools, and playing active sports in both schools. These results suggest that both homophily and social influence are important in understanding patterns of adolescent obesity. Intervention efforts should take into consideration peers' influence on one another, rather than treating \"high risk\" adolescents in isolation."

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "Within analytical customer relationship management (CRM), customer acquisition models suffer the most from a lack of data quality because the information of potential customers is mostly limited to socio-demographic and lifestyle variables obtained from external data vendors. Particularly in this situation, taking advantage of the spatial correlation between customers can improve the predictive performance of these models. This study compares an autoregressive and hierarchical technique that both are able to incorporate spatial information in a model that can be applied on large datasets, which is typical for CRM. Predictive performances of these models are compared in an application that identifies potential new customers for 25 products and brands. The results show that when a discrete spatial variable is used to group customers into mutually exclusive neighborhoods, a multilevel model performs at least as well as, and for a large number of durable goods even significantly better than a frequently used autologistic model. Further, this application provides interesting insights for marketing decision makers. It indicates that especially for publicly consumed durable goods neighborhood effects can be identified. However, for more exclusive brands, incorporating spatial information will not always result in major predictive improvements. For these luxury products, the high spatial interdependence is mainly caused by homophily in which the spatial variable is a substitute for absent socio-demographic and lifestyle variables. As a result, these neighborhood variables lose a lot of predictive value on top of a traditional acquisition model that typically is based on such non-transactional variables. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "Background: The goal of this research is to determine if different gender-preferred social styles can be observed within the user interactions at an online cancer community. To achieve this goal, we identify and measure variables that pertain to each gender-specific social style.Methods and Findings: We perform social network and statistical analysis on the communication flow of 8,388 members at six different cancer forums over eight years. Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to measure the difference between the number of intimate (and highly intimate) dyads, relationship length, and number of communications. We determine that two patients are more likely to form an intimate bond on a gender-specific cancer forum (ovarian P = <0.0001, breast P = 0.0089, prostate P = 0.0021). Two female patients are more likely to form a highly intimate bond on a female-specific cancer forum (Ovarian P < 0.0001, Breast P < 0.01). Typically a male patient communicates with more members than a female patient (Ovarian forum P = 0.0406, Breast forum P = 0.0013). A relationship between two patients is longer on the gender-specific cancer forums than a connection between two members not identified as patients (ovarian forum P = 0.00406, breast forum P = 0.00013, prostate forum P = .0.0003).Conclusion: : The high level of interconnectedness among the prostate patients supports the hypothesis that men prefer to socialize in large, interconnected, less-intimate groups. A female patient is more likely to form a highly intimate connection with another female patient; this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that woman prefer fewer, more intimate connections. The relationships of same-gender cancer patients last longer than other relationships; this finding demonstrates homophily within these online communities. Our findings regarding online communication preferences are in agreement with research findings from person-to-person communication preference studies. These findings should be considered when designing online communities as well as designing and evaluating psychosocial and educational interventions for cancer patients."

Specifically, based on social network and homophily paradigms in which individuals have a natural tendency to associate and interact frequently with others with similar characteristics, we constructed a relational inference model to determine the accuracy of self-administered consumer profiles. In addition, to flirt her enhance the reliability of our model's prediction capability, we employed the entropy mechanism that minimizes potential biases that may arise from a simple probabilistic approach. To empirically validate the accuracy of our inference framework, we obtained and analyzed over 20 million actual call transactions supplied by one of the largest global telecommunication service providers. The results suggest that our social network-based inference model consistently outperforms other competing mechanisms (e.g., weighted average and simple relational classifier) regardless of the criteria choice (e.g., number of call receivers, call duration, and call frequency), with an accuracy rate of approximately 93 percent. Finally, to confirm the generalizability of our findings, we conducted simulation experiments to validate the robustness of the results in response to variations in parameter values and increases in potential noise in the data. We discuss several implications related to business intelligence for both research and practice, and offer new directions for future studies."

These motivations also make them poor prospects for advertisers, as users seem disinterested in Facebook ads and disengaged from marketers' attempts to build brands.

    "Year": 2013,
    "Abs": "In one of the supreme ironies in ICT, social networking (SN) companies such as Facebook, search engine (SE) companies such as Google, and other major knowledge management (KM) organizations continue to rely on Nonaka and Konno's (1998) \"Ba,\" or physical space, for the internal creation and management of new ideas. Apparently, these companies believe employees still need to congregate in a physical place - an office - in order to share ideas, as opposed to creating and sharing knowledge in a totally virtual environment. In this theoretical exploration of physical space I propose that the next challenge facing knowledge management is eliminating the \"Ba,\" and in this paper we examine how that will facilitate the successful sharing of knowledge in a world where place truly ceases to have meaning. The challenge is formidable, because human beings still seem to require a common time and place to meet in order to be synchronous. We see this in all aspects of our lives, from our work offices to our educational institutions. Although we have become adept at knowledge sharing in virtual spaces in an asynchronous mode, we are still bound by the chains of human culture and psychology in the synchronous mode. The reason seems to be that we still rely on physical places to reference and give organization to human societies, and thereby provide the conditions for what sociologists refer to as homophily. Makela et al (2007) have shown that we still tend to share knowledge to a greater degree with people who resemble us, or share our cultural identities, but Jameson (2007) has shown that in a globalized world, where national borders have become blurred, it can no longer be presumed that cultural identity is equivalent to nation, or to some shared physical space. In fact, in virtual spaces we need to accept that knowledge will increasingly be created and shared by individuals who are not homophilous, as discussed by Murthy (2013) in regard to Twitter, and therefore need to adapt to a world without \"Ba\". Nonaka et al (2000) have identified four types of \"Ba\": originating \"Ba\", dialoguing \"Ba\", systemising \"Ba\" and exercising \"Ba\". This paper will look at each of these \"Ba\" and how they could be eliminated. Nonaka has stated that although \"Ba\" resemble Wenger's (1999) communities of practice (CoPs), \"Ba\" need energy to operate, while communities of practice remain functional, to some extent, even though they are neither nurtured nor maintained. I believe it is this need for energy that limits the \"Ba,\" and ultimately limits our ability to optimally engage in knowledge sharing in a world where space and place holds less and less meaning for more and more people. When we are finally able to expend less energy clinging to our \"Ba\", we will have more time and energy for creating the knowledge and ideas that were the reasons people first began to construct their \"Ba\" - their physical communities of practice - in a time and place before the existence of what we now know as cyberspace."

Social media provides us an unprecedented way to collect and analyze billions of users' information. Proper user attribute identification or profile inference becomes more and more attractive and feasible. However, the flourishing social records also pose great challenge in effective feature selection and integration for user profile inference. This is mainly caused by the text sparsity and complex community structures.In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework to infer user's occupation from his/her social activities recorded in micro-blog message streams. A multi-source integrated classification model is set up with some fine selected features. We first identify some beneficial basic content features, and then we proceed to tailor a community discovery based latent dimension solution to extract community features.Extensive empirical studies are conducted on a large real micro-blog dataset. Not only we demonstrate the integrated model shows advantages over several baseline methods, but also we verify the effect of homophily in users' interaction records. The different effects of heterogeneous interactive networks are also revealed."

The hypernetwork relaxes the assumption that only two nodes can participate in a link, permitting instead an arbitrary number of nodes to participate in so-called hyperlinks or hyperedges, which is a more natural representation for complex, multi-party relations. However, the hyperlink prediction problem has yet to be studied. In this paper, we propose HPLSF (Hyperlink Prediction using Latent Social Features), a hyperlink prediction algorithm for hypernetworks. By exploiting the homophily property of social networks, HPLSF explores social features for hyperlink prediction. To handle the problem that social features are not always observable, a latent social feature learning scheme is developed. To cope with the arbitrary cardinality hyperlink issue in hypernetworks, we design a feature-embedding scheme to map the a priori arbitrarily-sized feature set associated with each hyperlink into a uniformly-sized auxiliary space. To address the fact that observed features and latent features may be not independent, we generalize a structural SVM to learn using both observed features and latent features. In experiments, we evaluate the proposed HPLSF framework on three large-scale hypernetwork datasets. Our results on the three diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the HPLSF algorithm. Although developed in the context of social networks, HPLSF is a general methodology and applies to arbitrary hypernetworks."

    "Year": 2013,
    "Abs": "Social scientists have identified several network relationships and dimensions that induce homophily. Sentiments or opinions towards different issues have been observed as a key dimension which characterizes human behavior. Twitter is an online social medium where rapid communication takes place publicly. People usually express their sentiments towards various issues. Different persons from different walks of social life may share same opinion towards various issues. When these persons constitute a group, such groups can be conveniently termed same wavelength groups. We propose a novel framework based on sentiments to identify such same wavelength groups from twitter domain. The analysis of such groups would be of help in unraveling their response patterns and behavioral features."

    "Year": 2013,
    "Abs": "The purpose of this study is to find out under what conditions homophily reinforce the diffusions over social networks or undermines them. To realize this aim, formal modeling approach is utilized and an Agent-Based Model is constructed. Afterwards, diffusion of a non-sticky innovation is investigated with the experiments having varying homophily levels in a social network with two distinct kinds of agents as the primary control variable. The results show that (i) homophily reinforces itself (ii) looking at the macro-behavior of the diffusion, initial increases in the level of homophily has a positive effect on adopted fraction of the population whereas further increases have a negative impact, and (iii) looking at the micro-behavior of the diffusion, increasing homophily can result in local maxima even the macro trend is decreasing. Connectedness and average degrees interacting with social persuasion are the two explanatory remarks in the course of investigating the impact of homophily. As a by-product, the model is also capable of capturing the segregation dynamics over social networks. Future research involves allowing the adopted innovation to lead to value homophily, exploration of the different diffusion initiation types and adoption heuristics."

    "Year": 2013,
    "Abs": "Current mining algorithms for attributed graphs exploit dependencies between attribute information and edge structure, referred to as homophily. However, techniques fail if this assumption does not hold for the full attribute space. In multivariate spaces, some attributes have high dependency with the graph structure while others do not show any dependency. Hence, it is important to select congruent subspaces (i.e., subsets of the node attributes) showing dependencies with the graph structure.In this work, we propose a method for the statistical selection of such congruent subspaces. More specifically, we define a measure which assesses the degree of congruence between a set of attributes and the entire graph. We use it as the core of a statistical test, which congruent subspaces must pass. To illustrate its applicability to common graph mining tasks and in order to evaluate our selection scheme, we apply it to community outlier detection. Our selection of congruent subspaces enhances outlier detection by measuring outlierness scores in selected subspaces only. Experiments on attributed graphs show that our approach outperforms traditional full space approaches and gives way to better outlier detection."

In healthcare, discovering communities may enhance the quality of web offerings for people with chronic diseases. Understanding the social dynamics and community attachments is key to predicting and influencing interaction and information flow to the right patients.Objectives: The goal of the study is to empirically assess the extent to which we can infer meaningful community structures from implicit networks of peer interaction in online healthcare forums.Methods: We used datasets from five online diabetes forums to design networks based on peer-interactions. A quality function based on user interaction similarity was used to assess the quality of the discovered communities to complement existing homophily measures.Results: Results show that we can infer meaningful communities by observing forum interactions. Closely similar users tended to co-appear in the top communities, suggesting the discovered communities are intuitive. The number of years since diagnosis was a significant factor for cohesiveness in some diabetes communities.Conclusion: Network analysis is a tool that can be useful in studying implicit networks that form in healthcare forums. Current analysis informs further work on predicting and influencing interaction, information flow and user interests that could be useful for personalizing medical social media."

    "Abs": "Microblogging recommendation is to find useful microblogging messages that users are really interested in. Existing methods of microblogging recommendation have low personalization for the reason of focusing on the whole microblogging social network. On microblogging site, different users have different active degree, and different users have considerable variability in structures of followees or followers. It is therefore most necessary to understand microblogging from an individual user's perspective. In this paper, we propose a novel model of microblogging recommendation based on ego networks, called EgoRec, which has the ability of capturing personal interests more accurately. Specifically, the key idea of EgoRec is to make recommendation by homophily of ego networks. We take egos as target users being recommended, while alters as source users for recommendation. Homophily between individual users can be measured by ego profile factors and ego-alter social relations. We define three main social relations in ego networks: support relation, affinity relation and focal relation for recommendation. Moreover, by detecting latent factor and combining with the homophily factors in ego networks, it makes EgoRec more personalized. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets clearly validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the EgoRec model."

This collective applied capability in future can be used as a predictor of performance or success of teams that have been given an assignment.In this context capability is defined as the application of a set of inherent and acquired resources and the level of their utilization to complete a job. These resources are classified into three categories Enablers, Preferences and past Attainments. The collective capability is therefore inferred from the interrelationship between the members with respect to their Diversity, Homophily, and their past Experiences/Attainments working in teams.By reviewing the relevant literature a basic definition for capability is provided. Also to introduce a method for measuring collective capability, the existing literature on analysis of social networks and methods of interpreting and modeling the dynamics of human networks are briefly discussed.Such a modeling tool enables managers and decision makers to measure and compare different group formations with respect to their capability and use this capability index as a predictor of future performance. Companies and project managers will be able to implement special team building policies and strategies to maximize their capabilities to ensure better outcomes."

    "Year": 2013,
    "Abs": "Characterizing user pair relationships is important for applications such as friend recommendation and interest targeting in online social networks (OSNs). Due to the large scale nature of such networks, it is infeasible to enumerate all user pairs and so sampling is used. In this paper, we show that it is a great challenge even for OSN service providers to characterize user pair relationships even when they possess the complete graph topology. The reason is that when sampling techniques (i.e., uniform vertex sampling (UVS) and random walk (RW)) are naively applied, they can introduce large biases, in particular, for estimating similarity distribution of user pairs with constraints such as existence of mutual neighbors, which is important for applications such as identifying network homophily. Estimating statistics of user pairs is more challenging in the absence of the complete topology information, since an unbiased sampling technique such as UVS is usually not allowed, and exploring the OSN graph topology is expensive. To address these challenges, we present asymptotically unbiased sampling methods to characterize user pair properties based on UVS and RW techniques respectively. We carry out an evaluation of our methods to show their accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we apply our methods to two Chinese OSNs, Doudan and Xiami, and discover significant homophily is present in these two networks."

    "Title": "Assessing group cohesion in homophily networks",
    "Year": 2013,
    "Abs": "The analysis and exploration of a social network depends on the type of relations at play. Borgatti had proposed a type taxonomy organizing relations in four possible categories. Homophily (similarity) relationships form an important category where relations occur when entities of the network link whenever they exhibit similar behaviors. Examples are networks of co-author, where homophily between two persons follows from co-authorship; or network of actors having played under the supervision of the same movie director, for instance. Homophily is often embodied through a bipartite network where entities of a given type A (authors, movie directors) connect through entities of a different type B (papers, actors). A common strategy is then to project this bipartite graph onto a single-type network with entities of a same type A, possibly weighting edges based on how the type A entities interact with the type B entities underlying the edge. The resulting single-type network can then be studied using standard techniques such as community detection using edge density, or the computation of various centrality indices. This paper revisits this type of approach and introduces a homogeneity measure inspired form past work by Burt. Two entities of type B interact when they both induce a same edge between two entities of type A. The homogeneity of a subgroup thus depends on how intensely and how equally interactions occur between entities of type B giving rise to the subgroup. The measure thus differentiates between subgroups of type A exhibiting similar topologies depending on the interaction patterns of the underlying entities of type B. The method is validated using two widely used datasets. A first example looks at authors of the IEEE InfoVis Conference (InfoVis 2007 Contest). A second example looks at homophily relations between movie actors that have played under the direction of a same director (IMDB)."

In this paper we justify the existence of the social influence by considering the temporal behavior of Last.fm users. In order to clearly distinguish between friends sharing the same interest, especially since Last.fm recommends friends based on similarity of taste, we separated the timeless effect of similar taste from the temporal impulses of immediately listening to the same artist after a friend. We measured strong increase of listening to a completely new artist in a few hours period after a friend compared to non-friends representing a simple trend or external influence. In our experiment to eliminate network independent elements of taste, we improved collaborative filtering and trend based methods by blending with simple time aware recommendations based on the influence of friends. Our experiments are carried over the two-year \"scrobble\" history of 70,000 Last.fm users."

In online social networks, for instance, interactions related to friendship, kinship, business, interests, and other relationships may all be represented as catchall \"friendships.\" Because several relations are mingled into one, the resulting networks exhibit relatively high and uniform density. As a consequence, the variation in positional differences and local cohesion may be too small for reliable analysis.We introduce a method to identify the essential relationships in networks representing social interactions. Our method is based on a novel concept of triadic cohesion that is motivated by Simmel's concept of membership in social groups. We demonstrate that our Simmelian backbones are capable of extracting structure from Facebook interaction networks that makes them easy to visualize and analyze. Since all computations are local, the method can be restricted to partial networks such as ego networks, and scales to big data."

This paper addresses the logic behind the egocentric network analysis by taking into account the level of influence of individuals whom they are connected within a network. We also discusses the features of those customers who adapted to certain services within a network and the likelihood of the others adapting to similar services from the same network is predictable. Hence the ROI on marketing towards consumers who belongs to same network increases significantly."

We then look at how friendships are formed, focusing on the concepts of propinquity and homophily and how they play out within the context of online friendships. We delineate the major dimensions of friendship that have emerged in theory and research and then comment on how these features of friendship may be affected by the advent of widespread electronic communication. The differences between offline and online companionship, social support, tangible support and protection, exclusiveness, conflict resolution and relationship stability are also considered.

On the individual level females perform better economically and are less risk-taking than males. Males reciprocate friendship requests from females faster than vice versa and hesitate to reciprocate hostile actions of females. On the network level females have more communication partners, who are less connected than partners of males. We find a strong homophily effect for females and higher clustering coefficients of females in trade and attack networks. Cooperative links between males are under-represented, reflecting competition for resources among males. These results confirm quantitatively that females and males manage their social networks in substantially different ways."

    "Abs": "We study the issue of polarization in society through a model of opinion formation. We say an opinion formation process is polarizing if it results in increased divergence of opinions. Empirical studies have shown that homophily, i.e., greater interaction between like-minded individuals, results in polarization. However, we show that De Groot's well-known model of opinion formation based on repeated averaging can never be polarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We generalize DeGroot's model to account for a phenomenon well known in social psychology as biased assimilation: When presented with mixed or inconclusive evidence on a complex issue, individuals draw undue support for their initial position, thereby arriving at a more extreme opinion. We show that in a simple model of homophilous networks, our biased opinion formation process results in polarization if individuals are sufficiently biased. In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation, is not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased assimilation also provides a framework to analyze the polarizing effect of Internet-based recommender systems that show us personalized content."

Furthermore, the algorithm considers the probability of links that depends on geographical distance between potential partners.The resulting network reflects social settings and furthermore allows the modeller to influence network properties by adjusting agent type specific parameters. Especially the parameter for distance dependence and the probability of distant links allow for control of clustering and agent type distribution of personal networks."

In particular, we focus on investigating how a reciprocal (two-way) link, the basic relationship in social networks, is developed from a parasocial (one-way) relationship and how the relationships further develop into triadic closure, one of the fundamental processes of link formation.We first investigate how geographic distance and interactions between users influence the formation of link structure among users. Then we study how social theories including homophily, social balance, and social status are satisfied over networks with parasocial and reciprocal relationships. The study unveils several interesting phenomena. For example, \"friend's friend is a friend\" indeed exists in the reciprocal relationship network, but does not hold in the parasocial relationship network.We propose a learning framework to formulate the problems of predicting reciprocity and triadic closure into a graphical model. We demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 90% of reciprocal relationships in a Twitter network. The proposed model also achieves better performance (+20-30% in terms of F1-measure) than several alternative methods for predicting the triadic closure formation."

    "Year": 2013,
    "Abs": "Traditional CRM models often ignore the correlation that could exist among the purchasing behavior of surrounding prospects. Hence, a generalized linear autologistic regression model can be used to capture this interdependence and improve the predictive performance of the model. In particular, customer acquisition models can benefit from this. These models often suffer from a lack of data quality due to the limited amount of information available about potential new customers. Based on a customer acquisition model of a Japanese automobile brand, this study shows that the extra value resulting from incorporating neighborhood effects can vary significantly depending on the granularity level on which the neighborhoods are composed. A model based on a granularity level that is too coarse or too fine will incorporate too much or too little interdependence resulting in a less than optimal predictive improvement. Since neighborhood effects can have several sources (i.e.social influence, homophily and exogeneous shocks), this study suggests that the autocorrelation can be divided into several parts, each optimally measured at a different level of granularity. Therefore, a model is introduced that simultaneously incorporates multiple levels of granularity resulting in even more accurate predictions. Further, the effect of the sample size is examined. This shows that including spatial interdependence using finer levels of granularity is only useful when enough data is available to construct stable spatial lag effects. As a result, extending a spatial model with multiple granularity levels becomes increasingly valuable when the data sample becomes larger."

Complex contagions, unlike infectious diseases (simple contagions), are affected by social reinforcement and homophily. Hence, the spread within highly clustered communities is enhanced, while diffusion across communities is hampered. A common hypothesis is that memes and behaviors are complex contagions. We show that, while most memes indeed spread like complex contagions, a few viral memes spread across many communities, like diseases. We demonstrate that the future popularity of a meme can be predicted by quantifying its early spreading pattern in terms of community concentration. The more communities a meme permeates, the more viral it is. We present a practical method to translate data about community structure into predictive knowledge about what information will spread widely. This connection contributes to our understanding in computational social science, social media analytics, and marketing applications."

In making adoption decisions, users rely not only on their own preferences, but also on friends. We call the latter social correlation, which may be caused by the homophily and social influence effects. In this paper, we focus on modeling social correlation on users item adoptions. Given a user-user social graph and an item-user adoption graph, our research seeks to answer the following questions: Whether the items adopted by a user correlate with items adopted by her friends, and how to model item adoptions using social correlation. We propose a social correlation framework that considers a social correlation matrix representing the degrees of correlation from every user to the users friends, in addition to a set of latent factors representing topics of interests of individual users. Based on the framework, we develop two generative models, namely sequential and unified, and the corresponding parameter estimation approaches. From each model, we devise the social correlation only and hybrid methods for predicting missing adoption links. Experiments on LiveJournal and Epinions data sets show that our proposed models outperform the approach based on latent factors only (LDA)."

To study the role of distance in ICT-enabled virtual worlds, we propose three dimensions of proximity-space, time, and homophily-and analyze the impact of distance, time zones, gender, age, and game age on building collaborative relations in online games. The results show that spatial proximity, temporal proximity, and homophily in age and game age still have a strong impact on players' behavior in creating online relations in virtual worlds, however, there is no evidence of gender homophily.

    "Abs": "With the rapid growth of smartphone usage, mobile social networks (MSNs) are becoming increasingly popular. MSN can be considered as a type of delay tolerant network (DTN) which lacks continuous end-to-end connections between nodes, due to the node mobility and limited transmission range. Inspired by the homophily of social networks that friends are usually similar in characteristics, we present a novel concept - cloud, where the nodes in frequent contact with the destinations will form destination clouds. Neighbors in the destination cloud have a special status that can forward the message to the destination directly. We propose a cloud-based multicast scheme with feedback in MSNs with two phases: pre-cloud and inside-cloud. In the pre-cloud process, the message holder will forward the copy of the multicast message to the encountered node, based on a given forwarding metric. The forwarding metric can be iteratively refined from a feedback control mechanism. In the inside-cloud process, the message holder will wait until it meets with the destinations. We analytically formulate the multicast problem into a continuous Markov chain problem, and formally analyze the latency in this model. Extensive trace-driven simulations show that our scheme significantly improves the performance compared to existing schemes."

Social media sites provide a valuable opportunity for social interactions between electronic commerce consumers as well as between consumers and businesses. Although the number of users and interactions is large in social media, the social networks extracted from explicit user interactions are usually sparse. Hence, the result obtained through the analysis of the extracted network is not always useful because many potential ties in the social network are not captured by the explicit interactions between users. In this work, we propose a temporal analysis technique to identify implicit relationships that supplement the explicit relationships identified through the social media interaction functions. Our method is based on the homophily theory developed by McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook [31]. We have conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the identified implicit relationships and the integration of implicit and explicit relationships. The results indicate that our proposed techniques are effective and achieve a higher accuracy. Our results prove the importance of implicit relationships in deriving complete online social networks that are the foundation for understanding online user communities and social network analysis. Our techniques can be applied to improve effectiveness of product and friend recommendation in social commerce."

    "Title": "Identity Multipliers and the Mistaken Twittering of 'Birds of a Feather'",
    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "New Media usage has expanded in unexpected directions. This qualitative study pulls together two new media phenomena that demonstrate widespread engineered influence through Twitter dispersion. The first aspect is the practice of sock-puppetry deception that occurs when social media identities are used without proof of identity. The relative ease in creating a single invented online identity is overshadowed by the more recent practise of harnessing thousands of created identities to accentuate the standing of a single identity. The second aspect is the use of metadata to fetch and find increased nodes of commonality. This promulgates the perception of connectivity and homogeneity in terms of information transfer. Identity masking in Twitter, and the use of homophily to manipulate authority, public sway, and social media deception are a formidable combination. This study considers the increasing use of sock-puppetry in conjunction with techniques that exploit homophily to sway the perceptions of others. The ethical and socio-political issues of identity deception and their subsequent impact are discussed. Using the publicly available Twitter accounts of six high profile political figures, the study compares retweets that retain metadata from original tweets. Using both real and fake accounts, the paper tests the hypothesis that non-genuine Sybil Twitter accounts are deployed in the followings of popular figures by using metadata in retweets to establish credibility amongst fake entities. New Media experiences augmented manipulation in multiple ways. The use of metatagging to expose greater commonality increases both the frequency and the amplitude of information diffusion when delivered through social networking and microblogging. A comparison of the associated tweets, followers, and retweets of high profile leaders indicate pervasive sock-puppetry and Sybil deception. With homophily embedded into Tweets and Retweets, sock puppetry in social media presents a challenge. Where homophily fits traditional notions of \"similarity between two nodes\", increasing the likelihood of likeness to occur is problematic. If homophily and false identity coalesce, then the use of twitter as a reliable social medium is contingent on discrete user identity in social media."

    "Abs": "A self-organization of efficient and robust networks is important for a future design of communication or transportation systems, however both characteristics are incompatible in many real networks. Recently, it has been found that the robustness of onion-like structure with positive degree-degree correlations is optimal against intentional attacks. We show that, by biologically inspired copying, an onion-like network emerges in the incremental growth with functions of proxy access and reinforced connectivity on a space. The proposed network consists of the backbone of tree-like structure by copyings and the peripheral by adding shortcut links between low degree nodes to enhance the connectivity. It has the fine properties of the statistically self-averaging unlike the conventional duplication-divergence model, exponential-like degree distribution without overloaded hubs, strong robustness against both malicious attacks and random failures, and the efficiency with short paths counted by the number of hops as mediators and by the Euclidean distances. The adaptivity to heal over and to recover the performance of networking is also discussed for a change of environment in such disasters or battlefields on a geographical map. These properties will be useful for a resilient and scalable infrastructure of network systems even in emergent situations or poor environments."

This study investigates such differences in the case of online social networking. We find a general tendency towards gender homophily, more marked for women, however users having a large circle of friends tend to have more connections with users of the opposite gender. We also inspect the temporal sequences of adding new friends and find that females are much more likely to connect with other females as their initial friends. Through studying triangle motifs broken down by gender we detect a marked tendency of users to gender segregation, i.e.to form single gender groups; this phenomenon is more accentuated for male users."

So Sam might like Snickers and live in Seattle. We use social network data from Twitter and Google+ to replicate this effect in a new environment. We find limited to no support for the Name-Letter Effect on social networks. We do, however, find a very robust Same-Name Effect where, say, Michaels would be more likely to link to other Michaels than Johns. This effect persists when accounting for gender, nationality, race, and age. The fundamentals behind these effects have implications beyond psychology as understanding how a positive self-image is transferred to other entities is important in domains ranging from studying homophily to personalized advertising and to link formation in social networks."

    "Abs": "Recommendation systems are popular both commercially and in the research community. For example, Online Social Networks (OSNs), like Twitter, are of special attention since a lot of connection are established between users without any previous knowledge. This highlights one of the key features of a lot of OSNs: the creation of relationships between users. Therefore, it is important to find new ways to provide interesting friendships suggestions.This work is the first step of an in-depth study whose goal is to find the right trade-offs between the number of factors explored in current state-of-the-art research. In particular, our contribution is an approach based on both Hubs And Authorities algorithm and similarity measures. The first one let us leverage triadic closures while the second one takes into account homophily. Even if the interplay between similarity and social ties is still an open issue in the analysis of OSNs, we lean towards the idea that it really counts.In order to support this hypothesis, a preliminary evaluation is performed on an implementation of the presented algorithm on datasets from Twitter. The deriving results show promising perspectives in terms of both effectiveness and scalability. These encouraging results are driving our future research efforts."

Each node in the graph represents an individual who has one or more skills. We introduce the concept of realistic team formation and its associated constraints and assumptions. The main constraint is a local view of the network resulting in an absence of pre-computed network statistics. Nodes in the network are assumed to connect to people with whom they share common skills. Thus, this paper proposes a navigation based team formation algorithm that makes use of homophily to recruit candidates for the team. The objective is to create an effective team that can carry out a specific task. Since none of the related work has had a local view of the network, we use BfsRecruiter, a BFS based navigation algorithm as our baseline comparison. We implemented the proposed algorithm and ran many simulation experiments to measure the communication cost and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

This methodology provides fruitful insights as it focuses on the users' browsing habits. The author interviewed a sample of professionals of tourism, cybertourists and bloggers.Findings - Results reveal that only part of e-WOM is granted credibility. Therefore, its persuasiveness depends on those limited positive judgements. Travellers use a conceptual mindset and a series of cognitive heuristics (homophily, crowd consensus, etc.) to assess credibility. Formal knowledge background and social pressures have proven to be weak.Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to a reduced sample of informants but their adjustment to the most typical profiles interviewed compensates this restriction. Another limitation is that data comes from a single cultural context (Spain), but on the other hand provides data that did not exist in the international literature on the topic.Practical implications - Outcomes can help tourism managers to monitor key heuristics employed by end-users in webs of e-WOM and detect new trends of travelling habits.Originality/value - The paper is original in that it establishes the rationalities behind the daily use of cognitive heuristics explored through different traveller's profiles."

The sample included 26,150 Twitter users and 892,034 relationships reflecting three types of messages.Findings - The results indicate that the discussion about President Myung-Bak Lee was dominated by liberal Twitter users who already had considerable influence both online and offline. In addition, Twitter users were unlikely to interact with other users with opposing political views.Research limitations/implications - Almost all of the opinion leaders identified in the study held liberal political views, and liberal Twitter users dominated the discussion network. In addition, the Korean Twitter network showed the presence of the homophily phenomenon, implying that opinion leaders' influence within the Twitter network was limited to other users sharing the same political views. Further, political views of opinion leaders were skewed toward a particular political stance without necessarily representing the opinion of the general public, possibly hindering the democratic process.Originality/value - This study tests the homophily thesis in the context of Twitter users in Korea and contributes to the literature on Twitter-based political discourse by identifying opinion leaders in Korean Twitter networks and examining the phenomenon of homophily within those networks."

There has been little theorizing on the nature and structuration of social media from which appropriate directed action can be strategically conceptualized. This paper presents novel theoretical foundations from which to understand social media and develop effective strategies to advance organizational interests."

    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "Tie formation in social networks is driven by different motives that are not always apparent in the social network itself. These motives differ from one social network to another, depending on, e.g., the network's purpose, such as advice seeking or collaboration, and the effort it costs to establish a friendship relationship. A common factor that exists in almost all social networks is homophily: the tendency of social network members to connect to similar members. In this work, we look at the tie formation process in social networks from a different perspective where we consider not only a social network SN, but also a set of associated interaction networks G(n) around it. We show, based on 6 social networks and in total 20 different associated interaction networks, that it is possible to predict the entire social network's structure to a satisfactory extent, only by knowing the structure of these interaction networks. As social networks are based on a voluntary relationship while some of the interaction relationships are at most semi-controllable for most members, e.g., being together in a team, this seems to indicate that whom we choose as a friend is also determined by whom we interact with."

The proposed model has mechanisms for dynamics on and of coevolving networks, which are node state change via social interactions and link rewiring based on homophily. The numerical simulation of the proposed model reveals that there exists two phase transitions for the parameters adaptability and homophily. This observation implies that the nature of the homophily principle lies in the adaptive mechanism in the proposed model."

Structural equation modelling analysis was conducted to examine the three levels of influential factors. These included self-perceptions of opinion leadership and seeking at the individual level, perceived tie strength and homophily at the network level, and finally, perceived news credibility and news preference at the news attribute level.Findings - The results revealed that the influences of self-perceptions of opinion leadership, perceived tie strength in online networks and perceived preference of online news had significant effects on users' news sharing intention in social media. However, self-perceptions of opinion seeking, homophily, and perceived news credibility were not significant.Originality/value - This is one of the first studies on news sharing in social media that focus on diverse levels of influential factors. In particular, the research suggests the viability of the diffusion of innovations theory to explain this pervasive global phenomenon.

    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "Link prediction has become an important and active research topic in recent years, which is prevalent in many real-world applications. Current research on link prediction focuses on predicting one single type of links, such as friendship links in social networks, or predicting multiple types of links independently. However, many real-world networks involve more than one type of links, and different types of links are not independent, but related with complex dependencies among them. In such networks, the prediction tasks for different types of links are also correlated and the links of different types should be predicted collectively. In this paper, we study the problem of collective prediction of multiple types of links in heterogeneous information networks. To address this problem, we introduce the linkage homophily principle and design a relatedness measure, called RM, between different types of objects to compute the existence probability of a link. We also extend conventional proximity measures to heterogeneous links. Furthermore, we propose an iterative framework for heterogeneous collective link prediction, called HCLP, to predict multiple types of links collectively by exploiting diverse and complex linkage information in heterogeneous information networks. Empirical studies on real-world tasks demonstrate that the proposed collective link prediction approach can effectively boost link prediction performances in heterogeneous information networks."

This study relies on a large dataset, containing 479, 048 users and 5, 263, 351 user-generated interests, captured from Facebook. We identify the social features from three types of the users' information - demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location), social relations (i.e., friendship), and users' interests. The results reveal that the interest similarity follows the homophily principle. Particularly, the results show that two users are more likely to be alike in their interests 1) if they exhibit more similarity in their demographic characteristics (e.g., similar age, same gender, or close to each other geographically), or 2) if they are more intimate in their friendship, or 3) if they present a higher average interest individuality (i.e., a measurement for estimating the personalized characteristics of a user's interests). The empirical observations could be exploited to infer how two users are alike in their interests according to the social features, which could be further harnessed by various practical applications and services, such as recommendation system and advertisement service."

In many settings, agents exhibit skepticism in the presence of people whose beliefs radically different from their own, and they are reluctant to be persuaded by such individuals. We present a model of opinion dynamics where agents are receptive toward other agents that have similar opinions, but remain skeptical of agents holding disparate opinions. We analyze how agents with extreme opinions affect the general population, using simulations on Barabasi-Albert random graphs, and modified Erdos-Renyi random graphs that incorporate homophily. Finally, we show that even skeptical agents are able to come to an early consensus and take coordinated action to reach a final opinion in most settings; but, agents in homophilic networks may fail to converge to a single opinion. Paradoxically, this happens when agents are least skeptical, and are able to stabilize themselves by balancing influence from extremists from opposing camps."

However, in many websites such as Amazon and eBay, there is no explicit social graph that can be used to improve the recommendation performance. Hence in this work, in order to make it possible to employ social recommendation methods in those non-social information websites, we propose a general framework to construct a homophily-based implicit social network by utilizing both the rating and comments of items given by the users. Our scalable framework can be easily extended to enhance the performance of any recommender systems without social network by replacing the homophily-based implicit social relation definition. We propose four methods to extract and analyze the implicit social links between users, and then conduct the experiments on Amazon dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed methods work better than traditional recommendation methods without social information."

Our methodology is based on case studies. We select a Web activity, identify the biases that affect it, and evaluate how the biases affect a population from online social networks using web mining techniques, and then, we design a visualization following an interactive and playful design approach to diminish the previously identified biases. We propose to evaluate the effect of our visualization designs in user studies by comparing them with state-of-the-art techniques considering a playful experiences framework."

    "Title": "Computational Models for Social Influence Analysis",
    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "Social influence occurs when one's opinions, emotions, or behaviors are affected by others, intentionally or unintentionally. In this article, we survey recent research progress on social influence analysis. In particular, we first give a brief overview of related background knowledge, and then discuss what is social influence. We try to answer this question in terms of homophily and the process of influence and selection. After that, we focus on describing computational models for social influence including models for influence probability learning and influence diffusion. Finally, we discuss potential applications of social influence.Preliminaries First we introduce some basic knowledge for social network analysis, including related theories in sociology, fundamental models underlying social networks, and algorithms or measures for quantifying social influence. For social theories, we introduce social balance theory [10], social status theory [21], structural hole theory [6, 22], and two-step information flow theory [19]. For social network models, we introduce the Erdos-Renyi (ER) model 1111, Small-World model [28], and the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model [4]. For algorithms, we review several fundamental problems in graph theory and the corresponding algorithms to solve them including the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for maximum flow in a flow network [12], the push-relabel maximum flow algorithm for finding k-densest subgraph [13], and the greedy algorithm for the set covering problem [1]. We will also go through standard measures and concepts of social networks and their connection to social influence such as centrality, clustering coefficient, closeness and betweenness. These measures are fundamental concepts about social network analysis, and are also deeply related to the importance or influence of nodes or edges in the networks.Definition and Existential Test As there is no a formal definition for social influence, we discuss its definition in terms of several related concepts such as homophily [20], conformity [8, 27], and selection. We further describe methodologies for verifying the existence of influence in various social networks. The methods include shuffle test [2] and randomization test [24]. We will give real world examples to demonstrate how the social influence behaves in different social networks. For example, Bond et al. [5] conducted a randomized controlled trial by delivering political mobilization messages to 61 million Facebook users. Their results verified the existence of social influence on political voting behavior - when one is aware that their friends have made the political votes, their likelihood to vote will significantly increase. Bakshy et al. [3] also conducted randomized controlled trials to verify the existence of social influence on customer responses to advertising in Facebook.Computational Models We now focus on describing the computational models for social influence analysis, with an emphasis on influence quantification and influence diffusion. In particular, for influence quantification, we introduce several popular methods for learning the influence probability between users. For example, Tang et al. [26] presented a Topical Affinity Propagation (TAP) approach to quantify the topic-level social influence in large networks. Goyal et al. [14] presented a method to learn the influence probabilities by counting the number of correlated social actions. Tan et a. [25] proposed a model to learn and distinguish the effects of influence, correlation, and uses' action dependency. Kutzkov et al. [18] extended influence probability learning to the stream data. They showed that the influence probabilities could be learned with one pass over the streaming data using only O(n log n) space, where n is the number of nodes in a network.For influence diffusion, we start with several state-of-the-art epidemic models such as Susceptible Infectious-Recovered (SIR) [17], Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS), and Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS). Then, we focus on the two popular influence maximization model including independent cascaded model and linear threshold model. The problem of influence maximization has been formally defined as an algorithmic problem by Domingos and Richardson [9, 23]. Kempe et al. [16] further presented the independent cascaded model and the linear threshold model, and theoretically proved the NP-hardness of the two models. They defined the problem using submodular functions, with which a natural greedy strategy could obtain a solution that is provably within (1 -1/e) of optimal solution. Chen et al. [7] further developed efficient algorithms to approximately solve the influence maximization problem. Finally we will also discuss several extensions of the basic cascaded and linear threshold models, e.g., [15, 30, 29].Applications Finally we use several real applications as examples to further demonstrate the usefulness of social influence analysis. We empirically study social influence in more than 10 datasets including Twitter, Weibo, Flickr, Gowalla, Coauthor, Mobile, Slash-dot, Enron, Epinions, etc. We will share our experience and interesting findings when studying social influence on these data."

    "Abs": "In online social networks, people tend to connect with like-minded people and read agreeable information. Direct recommendation of challenging content has not worked well because users do not value diversity and avoid challenging content. In this poster, we investigate the possibility of an indirect approach by introducing intermediary topics, which are topics that are common to people having opposing views on sensitive issues, i.e., those issues that tend to divide people. Through a case study about a sensitive issue discussed in Twitter, we show that such intermediary topics exist, opening a path for future work in recommendation promoting diversity of content to be shared."

    "Title": "Understanding Spatial Homophily: The Case of Peer Influence and Social Selection",
    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "Homophily is a phenomenon observed very frequently in social networks and is related with the inclination of people to be involved with others that exhibit similar characteristics. The roots of homophily can be subtle and are mainly traced back to two mechanisms: (i) social selection and (ii) peer influence. Decomposing the effects of each of these mechanisms requires analysis of longitudinal data. This has been a burden to similar studies in traditional social sciences due to the hardness of collecting such information. However, the proliferation of online social media has enabled the collection of massive amounts of information related with human activities. In this work, we are interested in examining the forces of the above mechanisms in the context of the locations visited by people. For our study, we use a longitudinal dataset collected from Gowalla, a location-based social network (LBSN). LBSNs, unlike other online social media, bond users' online interactions with their activities in real-world, physical locations. Prior work on LBSNs has focused on the influence of geographical constraints on the formation of social ties. On the contrary, in this paper, we perform a microscopic study of the peer influence and social selection mechanisms in LBSNs. Our analysis indicates that while the similarity of friends' spatial trails at a geographically global scale cannot be attributed to peer influence, the latter can explain up to 40% of the geographically localized similarity between friends. Moreover, this percentage depends on the type of locations we examine, and it can be even higher for specific categories (e.g., nightlife spots). Finally, we find that the social selection mechanism, is only triggered by places that exhibit specific network characteristics. We believe that our work can have significant implications on obtaining a deeper understanding of the way that people create friendships, act and move in real space, which can further facilitate and enhance applications such as recommender systems, trip planning and marketing."

    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "Reacting to social issues or events through Online Social Networks has become a social habit. Social scientists have identified several network relationships and dimensions that induce homophily. Sentiments or opinions towards different issues have been observed as a key dimension which characterizes human behaviour. People usually express their sentiments towards various issues. Different persons from different walks of social life may share same opinion towards various issues. When these persons constitute a group, such groups can be conveniently termed same wavelength groups. We propose a novel framework based on sentiments and an algorithm to identify such same wavelength groups from online social networks like twitter. The proposed algorithm generates same wavelength groups in polynomial time for relatively small set of events. The analysis of such groups would be of help in unravelling their response patterns and behavioural features."

    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "Service-oriented multi-agent systems are dynamic systems that are populated by heterogeneous agents. These agents model their functionality as services in order to allow heterogeneous agents or other entities to interact with each other in a standardized way. Furthermore, due to the large-scale and adaptative needs of the system, traditional directory facilitators or middle-agents are not suitable for the management of agent services. This article proposes the introduction of homophily in service-oriented multi-agent systems to create efficient decentralized and self-organized structures where agents have a greater probability of establishing links with similar agents than with dissimilar ones. This similarity is based on two social dimensions: the set of services that an agent provides and the organizational roles that it plays. A second contribution is an algorithm for service discovery that it is carried out taking into account the local information that is related to the homophily between agents. The experiments compare our proposal with other proposals in distributed environments. The results show that the proposed structure and algorithm offer desirable features for service discovery in decentralized environments. Specifically, these features provide short paths and a high success rate in the service discovery process and resilience under deliberate failures."

    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "The effects of social influence and homophily suggest that both network structure and node-attribute information should inform the tasks of link prediction and node-attribute inference. Recently, Yin et al. [2010a, 2010b] proposed an attribute-augmented social network model, which we call Social-Attribute Network (SAN), to integrate network structure and node attributes to perform both link prediction and attribute inference. They focused on generalizing the random walk with a restart algorithm to the SAN framework and showed improved performance. In this article, we extend the SAN framework with several leading supervised and unsupervised link-prediction algorithms and demonstrate performance improvement for each algorithm on both link prediction and attribute inference. Moreover, we make the novel observation that attribute inference can help inform link prediction, that is, link-prediction accuracy is further improved by first inferring missing attributes. We comprehensively evaluate these algorithms and compare them with other existing algorithms using a novel, large-scale Google+ dataset, which we make publicly available"

Thus, these groups generally overlap with each other; an overlap between two groups can be characterized by the number of common members. These common members can play a crucial role in the transmission of information between the groups. As a step towards understanding the information dissemination, we perceive the system as a pruned intergroup network and show that it maps to a very basic graph theoretic concept known as a threshold graph. We analyze several structural properties of this network such as degree distribution, largest component size, edge density, and local clustering coefficient. We compare the theoretical predictions with the results obtained from several online social networks (LiveJournal, Flickr, YouTube) and find a good match."

    "Abs": "Homophily and preferential attachment are among the most recognized mechanisms of network evolution. Instead of examining the two mechanisms separately, this study considers them jointly in a scholarly collaboration network. Specifically, when a new scholar enters a field, how does he/she choose the first collaborator from the pool of available scholars? We find that new scholars tend to collaborate with someone who works in the same institution (which is called constrained acceptance), shares similar specialty interests (active choice), or has already worked with many collaborators (random action). We view constrained acceptance and active choice as supporting evidence for homophily (because similarity is attractive) and random action as supporting evidence for preferential attachment (because popularity is attractive). As such, both homophily and preferential attachment affect the evolution of collaboration networks. Furthermore, the influences vary over time with random action, constrained acceptance, and active choice taking turns to act the dominant force at the beginning, middle and later phases of the evolution process, respectively."

    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "Peter Blau was one of the first to define a latent social space and utilize it to provide concrete hypotheses. Blau defines social structure via social \"parameters\" (constraints). Actors that are closer together (more homogenous) in this social parameter space are more likely to interact. One of Blau's most important hypotheses resulting from this work was that the consolidation of parameters could lead to isolated social groups. For example, the consolidation of race and income might lead to segregation. In the present work, we use Foursquare data from New York City to explore evidence of homogeneity along certain social parameters and consolidation that breeds social isolation in communities of locations checked in to by similar users.More specifically, we first test the extent to which communities detected via Latent Dirichlet Allocation are homogenous across a set of four social constraints-racial homophily, income homophily, personal interest homophily and physical space. Using a bootstrapping approach, we find that 14 (of 20) communities are statistically, and all but one qualitatively, homogenous along one of these social constraints, showing the relevance of Blau's latent space model in venue communities determined via user check-in behavior. We then consider the extent to which communities with consolidated parameters, those homogenous on more than one parameter, represent socially isolated populations. We find communities homogenous on multiple parameters, including a homosexual community and a \"hipster\" community, that show support for Blau's hypothesis that consolidation breeds social isolation. We consider these results in the context of mediated communication, in particular in the context of self-representation on social media."

    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of homophily on diffusion over social networks. An agent-based simulation model is developed to serve as the experimental ground for this analysis. Diffusion dynamics of a nonsticky innovation is investigated by varying homophily levels in the social network depicted in the model as the primary control variable. First of all, the results show that homophily is self-reinforcing. Second, starting from a nonhomophilous network, early increases in the level of homophily have a positive effect on the extent of diffusion, whereas further increases have a negative impact. Finally, several local minima and maxima are observed in the relation between the homophily level and the extent of diffusion. Our analysis focuses on node properties such as connectedness and average degrees in order to explain the observed regular relationship between homophily and diffusion. We argue that (i) homophily increases the connectedness of different status groups separately and (ii) increasing levels of homophily decreases the marginal importance of a single homophilous tie by increasing the sources of valuable information. Future research involves investigating the coevolution of social behavior and networks by allowing the adopted innovation to lead to value homophily, exploration of different diffusion initiation types, and different adoption heuristics."

By analyzing data that was gathered through a survey, we show that knowledge of a person's social network can be helpful to predict that person's e-commerce acceptance for different products. Our experimental setup is interesting for companies because (1) knowledge about only a small number of connections of potential customers is needed, (2) knowing the intensity of the relation is not necessary, and (3) data concerning variables such as age, gender and whether one likes working with the PC is not needed. Hence, companies can rely on publicly available data on their customers' social ties. Network-based classifiers tend to perform especially well for highly durable goods and for services for which few customers think it is appropriate to reserve them online. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abs": "Niche construction is the process by which organisms can alter the ecological environment for themselves, their descendants, and other species. As a result of niche construction, differences in selection pressures may be inherited across generations. Homophily, the tendency of like phenotypes to mate or preferentially associate, influences the evolutionary dynamics of these systems. Here we develop a model that includes selection and homophily as independent culturally transmitted traits that influence the fitness and mate choice determined by another focal cultural trait. We study the joint dynamics of a focal set of beliefs, a behavior that can differentially influence the fitness of those with certain beliefs, and a preference for partnering based on similar beliefs. Cultural transmission, selection, and homophily interact to produce complex evolutionary dynamics, including oscillations, stable polymorphisms of all cultural phenotypes, and simultaneous stability of oscillation and fixation, which have not previously been observed in models of cultural evolution or gene-culture interactions. We discuss applications of this model to the interaction of beliefs and behaviors regarding education, contraception, and animal domestication."

    "Abs": "Background: Despite the undisputed role of emotions in teamwork, not much is known about the make-up of emotions in online collaboration. Publicly available repositories of collaboration data, such as Wikipedia editor discussions, now enable the large-scale study of affect and dialogue in peer production.Methods: We investigate the established Wikipedia community and focus on how emotion and dialogue differ depending on the status, gender, and the communication network of the approximate to 12,000 editors who have written at least 100 comments on the English Wikipedia's article talk pages. Emotions are quantified using a word-based approach comparing the results of two predefined lexicon-based methods: LIWC and SentiStrength.Principal Findings: We find that administrators maintain a rather neutral, impersonal tone, while regular editors are more emotional and relationship-oriented, that is, they use language to form and maintain connections to other editors. A persistent gender difference is that female contributors communicate in a manner that promotes social affiliation and emotional connection more than male editors, irrespective of their status in the community. Female regular editors are the most relationship-oriented, whereas male administrators are the least relationship-focused. Finally, emotional and linguistic homophily is prevalent: editors tend to interact with other editors having similar emotional styles (e. g., editors expressing more anger connect more with one another).Conclusions/Significance: Emotional expression and linguistic style in online collaboration differ substantially depending on the contributors' gender and status, and on the communication network. This should be taken into account when analyzing collaborative success, and may prove insightful to communities facing gender gap and stagnation in contributor acquisition and participation levels."

    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "The identification of causal peer effects (also known as social contagion or induction) from observational data in social networks is challenged by two distinct sources of bias: latent homophily and unobserved confounding. In this paper, we investigate how causal peer effects of traits and behaviors can be identified using genes (or other structurally isomorphic variables) as instrumental variables (IV) in a large set of data generating models with homophily and confounding. We use directed acyclic graphs to represent these models and employ multiple IV strategies and report three main identification results. First, using a single fixed gene (or allele) as an IV will generally fail to identify peer effects if the gene affects past values of the treatment. Second, multiple fixed genes/alleles, or, more promisingly, time-varying gene expression, can identify peer effects if we instrument exclusion violations as well as the focal treatment. Third, we show that IV identification of peer effects remains possible even under multiple complications often regarded as lethal for IV identification of intra-individual effects, such as pleiotropy on observables and unobservables, homophily on past phenotype, past and ongoing homophily on genotype, inter-phenotype peer effects, population stratification, gene expression that is endogenous to past phenotype and past gene expression, and others. We apply our identification results to estimating peer effects of body mass index (BMI) among friends and spouses in the Framingham Heart Study. Results suggest a positive causal peer effect of BMI between friends."

The rapid development of online social networking services provides an opportunity to explore social networks together with information used in traditional recommender systems, such as customer demographics, product characteristics, and transactions. It also provides more applications for recommender systems. To tackle this social network-based recommendation problem, previous studies generally built trust models in light of the social influence theory. This study inspects a spectrum of social network theories to systematically model the multiple facets of a social network and infer user preferences. In order to effectively make use of these heterogonous theories, we take a kernel-based machine learning paradigm, design and select kernels describing individual similarities according to social network theories, and employ a non-linear multiple kernel learning algorithm to combine the kernels into a unified model. This design also enables us to consider multiple theories' interactions in assessing individual behaviors. We evaluate our proposed approach on a real-world movie review data set The experiments show that our approach provides more accurate recommendations than trust-based methods and the collaborative filtering approach. Further analysis shows that kernels derived from contagion theory and homophily theory contribute a larger portion of the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Cumulative advantage and success-breads-success also both describe the fact that advantage tends to beget further advantage. The concept is behind the many power laws and scaling behaviour in empirical data, and it is at the heart of self-organization across social and natural sciences. Here, we review the methodology for measuring preferential attachment in empirical data, as well as the observations of the Matthew effect in patterns of scientific collaboration, socio-technical and biological networks, the propagation of citations, the emergence of scientific progress and impact, career longevity, the evolution of common English words and phrases, as well as in education and brain development. We also discuss whether the Matthew effect is due to chance or optimization, for example related to homophily in social systems or efficacy in technological systems, and we outline possible directions for future research."

    "Abs": "A labor market model with heterogeneous workers and jobs is provided to investigate the effects of social networks as a job information channel regarding the level of mismatch between workers and firms. The efficiency in producing good matches of the formal market is compared to that of social networks. It is assumed that links between workers represent favoring relationships: workers recommend each other for any kinds of jobs, regardless of the quality of the resulting match. This study shows that as the fraction of ties connecting similar agents (homophily) increases, the level of mismatch decreases. If this fraction is sufficiently high, networks provide good matches at a higher rate than the formal market, for any efficiency level of the market. In this case, the mismatch level is lower in economies with social networks than it would be if workers did not use social contacts for job search. Hence, the presence of social networks can reduce mismatch despite favoritism. Implications of mismatch creation for the expected wages of jobs obtainable through different search methods are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The research model was empirically tested with data from a web-based survey of 209 Second Life users. Results revealed that avatar similarity impacts self-disclosure but with varying effects, depending on how it is mediated by variables of identifiability, self-awareness and self-presence. Specifically, appearance similarity affects homophily, which heightens self-awareness. This results in increased feelings of self-presence, which positively affects self-disclosure. Homophily also has the effect of heightening perceptions of identifiability, which decreases self-disclosure. Implications and applications are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

We identify tight communities of users in which peer influence may play a role and use instrumental variables to control for potential correlation between unobserved subscriber heterogeneity and friends' adoption. We provide evidence that the propensity of a subscriber to adopt increases with the percentage of friends who have already adopted. During a period of 11 months, we estimate that 14 percent of iPhone 3Gs sold by this carrier were due to peer influence. This result is obtained after controlling for social clustering, gender, previous adoption of mobile Internet data plans, ownership of technologically advanced handsets, and heterogeneity in the regions where subscribers move during the day and spend most of their evenings. This result remains qualitatively unchanged when we control for changes over time in the structure of the social network. We provide results from several policy experiments showing that, with this level of effect of peer influence, the carrier would have hardly benefitted from using traditional marketing strategies to seed the iPhone 3G to benefit from viral marketing."

We find that the strongest ties tend to link institutions across continents in research collaboration. However, the effect of geographic factors is still notable in light of the fact that most of the institutions in the largest subgroup are located in Europe. Examination of the network position, measured by degree centrality, indicates that homophily is more common than heterophily in the network. A relatively high number of relational ties are observed among institutions that have similar levels of network centrality. Mutual relations are prevalent among central institutions, while strong mutual solidarity exists between institutions on the periphery of the network. This study shows a general unstable international collaborative relationship among astronomical institutions. While more and more institutions have linked up in research collaboration, many of them keep relatively weak ties. Institutions tend not remain in the same subgroup, but link to different partners over time."

The updating process, which we call the process of mutual learning multiplier, is based on an actor's success and failure experiences in tying with the same-subgroup and cross-subgroup actors. Results from a Monte Carlo simulation of the model show that the mutual learning multiplier produces disproportional relationships between the initial distribution of identity attention and the level of segregation in social networks. We also find that those relationships are affected by the actors' attention to structural holes, rate of learning from experience, system size, and the identity heterogeneity of the system. Overall, the model provides insights into various dynamics of network structuration across time and space."

Inspired by homophily, we regularize based on a smooth relationship function, either defined from the data or with labels. In experiments, we demonstrate that this significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms in semi-supervised classification and in spectral data embedding for constrained clustering and dimensionality reduction."

    "Abs": "Since the launch of Facebook in 2004 and Twitter in 2006, the amount of publicly available social network data has grown in both scale and complexity. This growth presents significant challenges to conventional network analysis methods that rely primarily on structure. In this paper, we describe a generative model that extends structure-based connection preference methods to include preferences based on agent similarity or homophily. We also discuss novel methods for extracting model parameters from existing large scale networks (e.g., Twitter) to improve model accuracy. We demonstrate the validity of our proposed extensions and parameter extraction methods by comparing model-generated networks with and without the extensions to real-life networks based on metrics for both structure and homophily. Finally we discuss the potential implications for including homophily in models of social networks and information propagation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "In many real-world applications there is a need to monitor the distribution of a population across different classes, and to track changes in this distribution over time. As an example, an important task is to monitor the percentage of unemployed adults in a given region. When the membership of an individual in a class cannot be established deterministically, a typical solution is the classification task. However, in the above applications the final goal is not determining which class the individuals belong to, but estimating the prevalence of each class in the unlabeled data. This task is called quantification. Most of the work in the literature addressed the quantification problem considering data presented in conventional attribute format. Since the ever-growing availability of web and social media we have a flourish of network data representing a new important source of information and by using quantification network techniques we could quantify collective behavior, i.e., the number of users that are involved in certain type of activities, preferences, or behaviors. In this paper we exploit the homophily effect observed in many social networks in order to construct a quantifier for networked data. Our experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and the comparison with the existing state-of-the-art quantification methods shows that they are more accurate."

In this paper, we report our findings when analysing more than 26 thousand calls to the call centers of a large corporation in a Latin American country. We focus on the impact of gender and call duration on self reported customer satisfaction. Speech-based gender detection technology is employed to automatically detect the gender of the customer and the agent involved in the calls. A significant correlation is found between self-reported customer satisfaction at the end of the call and gender homophily between the customer and the call center's agent. Interestingly, we do not find any significant effect of call duration on satisfaction."

On top of that, due to the inherent evolving nature of data streams, it is expected that these algorithms manage to quickly adapt to both concept drifts and the appearance and disappearance of clusters. Nevertheless, many of the developed two-step algorithms are only capable of finding hyper-spherical clusters and are highly dependant on parametrization. In this paper we introduce SNCStream, a one-step online clustering algorithm based on Social Networks Theory, which uses homophily to find non-hyper-spherical clusters. Our empirical studies show that SNCStream is able to surpass density-based algorithms in cluster quality and requires feasible amount of resources (time and memory) when compared to other algorithms."

    "Abs": "It is generally accepted that the driving forces of establishing connections among people are social influence and homophily. Both of them eventually lead to the proximity of any two related individuals to some extent. However, a person always can be featured with some attributes different from his/her social networking partners. Accordingly, one person's direct and indirect social relationships are likely to intersect with others at some nodes in social networks. In this work, we study the novel task of identifying the hidden boundary that divides the social network into disjoint social circles according to any pair of nodes which we call social boundary. We put forward two methods to separate the social circles of any two nodes and thus can find out the social boundary. One is based on label propagation and the other is based on perceptron network model. We apply the methods on synthetic and real networks, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the areas in which it would be applied."

    "Abs": "With the increasing use of web services in everyday tasks, we are entering an era of Internet of Services (IoS). Service discovery and selection has become critical issue in the area of web services. Traditional service discovery approaches are often supported by centralized registries that could suffer from single point failure, performance bottleneck, and scalability issues in large scale systems. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a context-aware service discovery and selection approach in a decentralized peer-to-peer environment. In the approach homophily similarity was used for bootstrapping and distribution of nodes. The discovery process is based on the similarity of nodes, previous interaction and behaviour of the nodes, which will help the discovery process in a dynamic environment. Our approach is not only considering service discovery, but also the selection of the best available web service by taking into account the QoS properties of the web services. Experimental results were based on real world semantic web service dataset, the results showed that the approach achieved better performance and efficiency in both discovery and selection processes."

An active research topic is to investigate the structure of social networks, i.e.studying the processes that affect the formation of relationships in a social network. One of the most fundamental notions governing the structure of social networks is homophily. This principle provides us with an illustration of how a network's surrounding contexts can drive the formation of its links. Given a particular characteristic of interest like religion, gender and individuals' connections, we concerned to answer to this question \"does the network exhibits homophily according to individuals' characteristic?\" For this purpose, we proposed a new method that uses fuzzy concepts to measure social network homophily. In contrast to the traditional approaches, our method handles non-deterministic information in homophily detection process. We applied our approach on a sample dataset drawn from CLOOB social network service. The experimental results demonstrate our approach reaches good efficiency."

Users crave and very often expect tailored services that are based on the users' context or personal preferences. The users themselves, using forms, often provide such information. An inference solution typically addresses this problem. In this paper, we present and show by way of a real-world example, the first step towards incorporating information of the user's social networking behavior in the inference task. We define an initial indicator of a particular social phenomenon, called Homophily, and describe how the indicator measures the presence of homophily at certain moments, also capturing the degree to which it is present. Different from existing indicators, ours lends itself to indicating the presence of homophily in a way that is easier to comprehend, so that it may be easily integrated into and reinforce context-aware semantic computing."

Given known topic associations for some fraction of the users in an online microblogging platform, our goal is to infer the topics of interest for the remaining users in the same site. Specifically, we proposed a novel bi-relational graph model to capture the interactions among users and their shared topics of interests. The proposed graph model contains two sub-graphs: one corresponds to users and the other corresponds to topics. Such a representation allows for effective exploitation of both user homophily relation and topic correlation simultaneously. This is in contrast with previous work where these two factors are considered in isolation. Subsequently, the user interest discovery problem is formulated as a multi-label learning problem on the bi-relational graph, with the goal to estimate the optimized associations between user nodes and topic nodes across the two sub-graphs. Our experiment is carried out with a complete month-long data collected from Twitter and Tumblr via GNIP Decahose(1) and Firehose(2) respectively. The large-scale studies shed light on the effectiveness of inferring user interests based on the underlying social connections."

    "Abs": "Nodes of a social graph often represent entities with specific labels, denoting properties such as age-group or gender. Design of algorithms to assign labels to unlabeled nodes by leveraging node-proximity and a-priori labels of seed nodes is of significant interest. A semi-supervised approach to solve this problem is termed \"LPA-Label Propagation Algorithm\" where labels of a subset of nodes are iteratively propagated through the network to infer yet unknown node labels. While LPA for node labelling is extremely fast and simple, it works well only with an assumption of node-homophily - connected nodes are connected because they must deserve a similar label - which can often be a misnomer. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm \"Adaptive Label Propagation\" that dynamically adapts to the underlying characteristics of homophily, heterophily, or otherwise, of the connections of the network, and applies suitable label propagation strategies accordingly. Moreover, our adaptive label propagation approach is scalable as demonstrated by its implementation in Grappa, a distributed shared-memory system. Our experiments on social graphs from Facebook, YouTube, Live Journal, Orkut and Netlog demonstrate that our approach not only improves the labelling accuracy but also computes results for millions of users within a few seconds."

In order to give a comprehensive estimation of senators' political positions, some researchers estimated the ideal points on different topics. However, for those senators who are not that polarized, their ideal points are so sensitive to the voting records that even a small change will make a big difference, which may mislead the readers.In this paper, we propose a mass ideology-based voting model taking the senators' latent ideology into consideration. Firstly, we model the senators' general ideal points by using the following links on Twitter due to the reason that we have homophily in social networks. Secondly, we use the roll call data of different bills, which can be decomposed as a combination of different topics, to estimate the senator's adjustment on different topics. Finally, we combine the general ideal points and the adjustments together to analyze the senator's political positions. Additionally, two-stage learning algorithms are also shown in the following section. Compared with the Issued-Adjusted model, our model has an edge on classifying the senators on different topics. This model can also be used to predict the voting behavior. Then, we show a case study of a moderate senator and try to explain her voting behavior for some bills according to our research."

One of the layout algorithms is a classical force-directed method, the other two are designed to improve node distinction based on the common characteristic. We study how each of the three layout algorithms helps to get a fair estimate, and whether there is a tendency to over or underestimate the degree of homophily.

Community-contributed resources include a rich variety of teaching and learning resources such as lesson plans, presentation slides, animations and simulations. In this research, we consider whether the deduced relationships between members of the community constitute weak ties. A deduced relationship exists when two community members view or access the same resource. If these deduced relationships do constitute weak ties then other theorized network properties should also be manifest, namely homophily and triadic closures. Our findings support these theoretical conjectures. Firstly, results indicate that the strength of a tie is directly proportional to the level of similarity between users in the network (homophily property). Secondly, we found strong support for the triadic closure property as well; we developed a computational model to predict the formation of weak ties via triadic closures with an accuracy of 97.8%. Insights from our model can be used to improve a collaborative filtering approach for resource recommendation by predicting future similarity between users in the network."

Leveraging previous literature on homophily (i.e., \"love of those who are like themselves\"), we examined the relationship between vocabulary similarity (i.e., homophily of word usage) of thread posts and members' future interaction in online health communities. We quantitatively measured vocabulary similarity by calculating, in a vector space model, cosine similarity between the original post and the first reply in 20,499 threads. Our findings across five online health communities suggest that vocabulary similarity is a significant predictor of members' future interaction in online health communities. These findings carry practical implications for facilitating and sustaining online community participation through beneficial effects of homophily in the vocabulary of essential peer support."

We show that while pairwise dependency is necessary for some structural roles, it may be misleading for others. We also present SR-Diffuse, a novel method for identifying the structural roles of nodes within a network. It is an iterative algorithm following an optimization model able to learn simultaneously from topological features and structural homophily, combining both aspects. For assessing our method, we applied it in a classification problem in information cascades, comparing its performance against several baseline methods. The experimental results with Flickr and Digg data show that SR-Diffuse can improve the quality of the discovered roles and can better represent the profile of the individuals, leading to a better prediction of social classes within information cascades."

We study the homophily of users in social network, where users with tight social relationships will have more similar network usage and more opportunity to leave in union. When users come, we collect user data first, then we adopt the spectral clustering to classify users according to the collected user data. The controller distribute users from the same cluster to different APs.

First, hyperlink networks interact with social media activities. Second, hyperlink networks are shaped by both homophily and resource dependence. However, resource dependence theory better explains hyperlink networks. Third, in line with cohort effects, length of time since social media adoption matters for hyperlink network; early social media adopters were more likely to hyperlink to early adopters.

While there are already numerous models for single item diffusion, few have studied diffusion of multiple items, especially when items can interact with one another due to their inter-similarity. Moreover, the well-known homophily effect is rarely considered explicitly in the existing diffusion models. This work therefore fills this gap by proposing a novel model called Topic level Interaction Homophily Aware Diffusion (TIHAD) to include both latent factor level interaction among items and homophily factor in diffusion. The model determines item interaction based on latent factors and edge strengths based on homophily factor in the computation of social influence. An algorithm for training TIHAD model is also proposed. Our experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that: (a) homophily increases diffusion significantly, and (b) item interaction at topic level boosts diffusion among similar items. A case study on hashtag diffusion in Twitter also shows that TIHAD outperforms the baseline model in the hashtag adoption prediction task."

We formally define the problem of computing such group with better utilization as the p-biased-representative selection problem (p-BRSP). This problem has two separate objectives and is difficult to deal with. Thus, we also propose a new unified-objective which is a function of the two optimization objectives. Most importantly, we introduce two polynomial time heuristic algorithms for the problem, where each of which has an approximation ratio with respect to each of the objectives."

A critical challenge along this line is to identify the key factors that underline people's adoption behaviors and distinguish the relative contribution of each factor. Specifically, we model the final smartphone status of each user as a result of three influencing factors: the social influence factor, the homophily factor, and the personal factor. We further develop a supervised model that takes all three factors for smartphone adoption and at the same time learns the relative contribution of each factor from the data.

    "Abs": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine consumers' perceptions of using different types of 3D animated avatars as salespeople based on credibility, homophily, attractiveness and intention to interact.Design/methodology/approach - Using a survey method, participants (n = 120) evaluated four types of 3D animated avatars (i.e.human, fantasy, animal and humanoid) based on the supposition the avatars would represent a salesperson for an online retailer.Findings - The results show that avatar type has a significant influence on the perception of credibility, homophily, and attractiveness. Furthermore, credibility, homophily, and attractiveness significantly influence the intention to interact with the avatar. Overall, the human avatar was found to be perceived as the most credible, homophilous, attractive and was regarded as the highest in relation to intention to interact.Originality/value - The practical and theoretical implications are discussed to offer guidance to online retailers, graphic designers, and researchers in the benefits and pitfalls of utilizing 3D animated avatars as salespeople."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "The crowdfunding phenomenon has garnered a considerable amount of attention in recent years. Several online crowdfunding platforms have risen to prominence; they can be characterized as two-sided marketplaces. Recent research reveals initial insights into the dynamics and characteristics of crowdfunding networks arising from such marketplaces. This research, though, is restricted primarily to analyses of static network snapshots and at the dyadic level. In this study, we use a large longitudinal dataset to analyze the behavior of actors on both sides of the market who promote their own and fund others' projects. We investigate the influence of endogenous and exogenous effects on the dynamics of crowdfunding networks. Our results provide evidence for mechanisms promoting a hierarchical network organization and the absence of homophily-related mechanisms regarding gender or geographic distance. Moreover, we establish that experienced and popular project creators fund fewer projects."

For the ERGM, we checked the importance of belonging to one region and organization, difference of skills, and participation in TI, and for association rules, on a par with the regions, we added players roles, and a metric of their personal performance - fantasy points. Summing up the results, we found out the importance of homophily within regions, detected presence of vertical mobility, and discover the influence of the specific players roles."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "In Social Networks there is a trend for people of similar interests to associate with each other. Such a tendency is called homophily, and in this paper we study the effect it has on calculating user sentiment profiles. We collect Twitter data such as tweets and follower relationships, and we use that to calculate initial user profiles (topic sentiments) and user connectivity. The novel approach in this paper is in the way user sentiment is calculated by using the impact of the related users. This impact related users have on one another depends on the connectivity factor between two people. We show that applying such an approach, which utilizes user connectivity when calculating user profiles, leads to better accuracy and we also show that there are indications it might help in tackling the cold start problem."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Many of the world's most popular websites catalyze their growth through invitations from existing members. New members can then in turn issue invitations, and so on, creating cascades of member signups that can spread on a global scale. Although these diffusive invitation processes are critical to the popularity and growth of many websites, they have rarely been studied, and their properties remain elusive. For instance, it is not known how viral these cascades structures are, how cascades grow over time, or how diffusive growth affects the resulting distribution of member characteristics present on the site,In this paper, we study the diffusion of LinkedIn, an online professional network comprising over 332 million members, a large fraction of whom joined the site as part of a signup cascade. First we analyze the structural patterns of these signup cascades, and find them to be qualitatively different from previously studied information diffusion cascades. We also examine how signup cascades grow over time, and observe that diffusion via invitations on LinkedIn occurs over much longer timescales than are typically associated with other types of online diffusion. Finally, we connect the cascade structures with rich individual-level attribute data to investigate the interplay between the two. Using novel techniques to study the role of homophily in diffusion, we find striking differences between the local, edge-wise homophily and the global, cascade-level homophily we observe in our data, suggesting that signup cascades form surprisingly coherent groups of members."

    "Title": "Provably Fast Inference of Latent Features from Networks with Applications to Learning Social Circles and Multilabel Classification",
    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "A well known phenomenon in social networks is homophily, the tendency of agents to connect with similar agents. A derivative of this phenomenon is the emergence of communities. Another phenomenon observed in numerous networks is the existence of certain agents that belong simultaneously to multiple communities. An understanding of these phenomena constitutes a central research topic of network science.In this work we focus on a fundamental theoretical question related to the above phenomena with various applications: given an undirected graph G, can we infer efficiently the latent vertex features which explain the observed network structure under the assumption of a generative model that exhibits homophily? We propose a probabilistic generative model with the property that the probability of an edge among two vertices is a non-decreasing function of the common features they possess. This property is true for many real-world networks and surprisingly is ignored by many popular overlapping community detection methods as it was shown recently by the empirical work of Yang and Leskovec [44]. Our main theoretical contribution is the first provably rapidly mixing Markov chain for inferring latent features. On the experimental side, we verify the efficiency of our method in terms of run times, where we observe that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our method is more than 2 400 times faster than a state-of-theart machine learning method [37] and typically provides nontrivial speedups compared to BigClam [43]. Furthermore, we verify on real-data with ground-truth available that our method learns efficiently high quality labelings. We use our method to learn social circles from Twitter ego-networks and perform multilabel classification."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "In this paper we perform a large-scale homophily analysis on Twitter using a hierarchical representation of users' interests which we call a Twixonomy. In order to build a population, community, or single-user Twixonomy we first associate \"topical\" friends in users' friendship lists (i.e.friends representing an interest rather than a social relation between peers) withWikipedia categories. A word-sense disambiguation algorithm is used to select the appropriate wikipage for each topical friend. Starting from the set of wikipages representing \"primitive\" interests, we extract all paths connecting these pages with topmost Wikipedia category nodes, and we then prune the resulting graph G efficiently so as to induce a direct acyclic graph. This graph is the Twixonomy. Then, to analyze homophily, we compare different methods to detect communities in a peer friends Twitter network, and then for each community we compute the degree of homophily on the basis of a measure of pairwise semantic similarity. We show that the Twixonomy provides a means for describing users' interests in a compact and readable way and allows for a fine-grained homophily analysis. Furthermore, we show that mid-low level categories in the Twixonomy represent the best balance between informativeness and compactness of the representation."

    "Abs": "How can we tell when accounts are fake or real in a social network? And how can we tell which accounts belong to liberal, conservative or centrist users? Often, we can answer such questions and label nodes in a network based on the labels of their neighbors and appropriate assumptions of homophily (\"birds of a feather flock together\") or heterophily (\"opposites attract\"). One of the most widely used methods for this kind of inference is Belief Propagation (BP) which iteratively propagates the information from a few nodes with explicit labels throughout a network until convergence. A well-known problem with BP, however, is that there are no known exact guarantees of convergence in graphs with loops. This paper introduces Linearized Belief Propagation (LinBP), a linearization of BP that allows a closed-form solution via intuitive matrix equations and, thus, comes with exact convergence guarantees. It handles homophily, heterophily, and more general cases that arise in multi-class settings. Plus, it allows a compact implementation in SQL. The paper also introduces Single-pass Belief Propagation (SBP), a localized (or \"myopic\") version of LinBP that propagates information across every edge at most once and for which the final class assignments depend only on the nearest labeled neighbors. In addition, SBP allows fast incremental updates in dynamic networks. Our runtime experiments show that LinBP and SBP are orders of magnitude faster than standard BP, while leading to almost identical node labels."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Understanding how much two individuals are alike in their interests (i.e., interest similarity) has become virtually essential for many applications and services in Online Social Networks (OSNs). Since users do not always explicitly elaborate their interests in OSNs like Facebook, how to determine users' interest similarity without fully knowing their interests is a practical problem. In this paper, we investigate how users' interest similarity relates to various social features (e.g. geographic distance); and accordingly infer whether the interests of two users are alike or unalike where one of the users' interests are unknown. Relying on a large Facebook dataset, which contains 479,048 users and 5,263,351 user-generated interests, we present comprehensive empirical studies and verify the homophily of interest similarity across three interest domains (movies, music and TV shows). The homophily reveals that people tend to exhibit more similar tastes if they have similar demographic information (e.g., age, location), or if they are friends. It also shows that the individuals with a higher interest entropy usually share more interests with others. Based on these results, we provide a practical prediction model under a real OSN environment. For a given user with no interest information, this model can select some individuals who not only exhibit many interests but also probably achieve high interest similarities with the given user. Eventually, we illustrate a use case to demonstrate that the proposed prediction model could facilitate decision-making for OSN applications and services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "A growing number of online health communities offer individuals the opportunity to receive information, advice, and support from peers. Recent studies have demonstrated that these new online contacts can be important informational resources, and can even exert significant influence on individuals' behavior in various contexts. However little is known about how people select their health contacts in these virtual domains. This is because selection preferences in peer networks are notoriously difficult to detect. In existing networks, unobserved pressures on tie formation such as common organizational memberships, introductions to friends of friends, or limitations on accessibility may mistakenly be interpreted as individual preferences for interacting/not interacting with others. We address these issues by adopting a social media approach to studying network formation. We study social selection using an in vivo study within an online exercise program, in which anonymous participants have equal opportunities for initiating relationships with other program members. This design allows us to identify individuals' preferences for health contacts, and to evaluate what these preferences imply for members' access to new kinds of health information, and for the kinds of social influences to which they are exposed. The study was conducted within a goal-oriented fitness competition, in which participation was greatest among a small core of active individuals. Our results show that the active participants displayed indifference to the fitness and exercise profiles of others, disregarding information about others' fitness levels, exercise preferences, and workout experiences, instead selecting partners almost entirely on the basis of similarities on gender, age, and BMI. Interestingly, the findings suggest that rather than expanding and diversifying their sources of health information, participants' choices limited the value of their online resources by selecting contacts based on characteristics that are common sources of homophily in offline relationships. In light of our findings, we discuss design principles that may be useful for organizations and policy makers trying to improve the value of participants' social capital within online health programs.

    "Abs": "Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a link-tracing network sampling strategy for collecting data from hard-to-reach populations, such as injection drug users or individuals at high risk of being infected with HIV. The mechanism is to find initial participants (seeds), and give each of them a fixed number of coupons allowing them to recruit people they know from the population of interest, with a mutual financial incentive. The new participants are again given coupons and the process repeats. Currently, the standard RDS estimator used in practice is known as the Volz-Heckathorn (VH) estimator. It relies on strong assumptions about the underlying social network and the RDS process. Via simulation, we study the relative performance of the plain mean and VH estimators when assumptions of the latter are not satisfied, under different network types (including homophily and rich-get-richer networks), participant referral patterns, and varying number of coupons. The analysis demonstrates that the plain mean outperforms the VH estimator in many but not all of the simulated settings, including homophily networks. Also, we highlight the implications of multiple recruitment and varying referral patterns on the depth of RDS process. We develop interactive visualizations of the findings and RDS process to further build insight into the various factors contributing to the performance of current RDS estimation techniques."

Our proof-of-concept study focuses on CSNs based upon fingerprint similarity relationships calculated using the conventional Tanimoto similarity metric. The resulting CSNs are characterized with statistical measures from network science and compared in different ways. We show that the homophily principle, which is widely considered in the context of social networks, is a major determinant of the topology of CSNs of bioactive compounds, designed as threshold networks, typically giving rise to community structures. Many properties of CSNs are influenced by numerical features of the conventional Tanimoto similarity metric and largely dominated by the edge density of the networks, which depends on chosen similarity threshold values. However, properties of different CSNs with constant edge density can be directly compared, revealing systematic differences between CSNs generated from randomly collected or bioactive compounds."

In a multi-relationship network, friendship among people has been utilized to reinforce similarity of taste for recommendation system whose basic idea is similar to homophily, yet how the taste inversely affects friendship prediction is little discussed. This paper contributes to address the issue by analyzing two benchmark data sets both including user's behavioral information of taste and friendship based on the principle of homophily. It can be found that the creation of friendship tightly associates with personal taste. Especially, the behavioral information of taste involving with popular objects is much more effective to improve the performance of friendship prediction. However, this result seems to be contradictory to the finding in Zhang et al. (2013) that the behavior information of taste involving with popular objects is redundant in recommendation system. We thus discuss this inconformity to comprehensively understand the correlation between them. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "Abs": "SinaWeibo is a Twitter-like social network service emerging in China recently. We analyzed the hot weibos (tweets), which exceed threshold of being reposted for 1000 times, from a data set of 650 million weibos during August 2009 and January 2012. We classified the hot weibos into eight categories, namely Entertainment & Fashion, Hot Social Events, Leisure & Mood, Life & Health, Seeking for Help, Sales Promotion, Fengshui & Fortune and Deleted weibos. There are several findings. Firstly, Leisure & Mood and Hot Social Events account for almost 65% of all the hot weibos. This may indicate a potential dual-structure of the current society of China: On the one hand, economy of the country as a whole is gaining sustaining growth, which enables people to enjoy a better life and spare more time on leisure and mood topics. On the other hand, there still exist considerable amount of serious social problems, such as government corruption and environmental pollution, which draw people's concern and worries all the time. Secondly, users' posting and reposting behaviors are associated with user profiles, namely: (1) Gender. Male users generate two thirds of hot weibos. (2) Verification status. Verified users contribute 46.5% of hot weibos, who comprise only 0.1% in SinaWeibo user population. Interestingly, 39.2% of the verified-user-generated weibos are written by SPA users (who generate weibos of a particular style, or in a consistent way, e.g. to say words of wisdom, \"chicken-soup-soul\" like sentences, and jokes etc.). This complements the previous finding of Yu et al. (2012), implying that SinaWeibo is in an \"artificial inflation\" not only on the reposting side but also on the posting side. Unfortunately, only 14.4% of the hot weibos are created by grassroots (not verified users). (3) Geographical location. Users from different areas of China show distinct posting and reposting behaviors, which partially reflect their indigenous cultures. Finally, homophily is also examined for people's reposting behaviors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "Abs": "Individuals often judge others based on third-party gossip, rather than their own experience, despite the fact that gossip is error-prone. Rather than judging others on their merits, even when such knowledge is free, we judge based on the opinions of third parties. Here we seek to understand this observation in the context of the evolution of cooperation. If individuals are being judged on noisy social reputations rather than on merit, then agents might exploit this, eroding the sustainability of cooperation. We employ a version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Donation game, which has been used to simulate the evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity. First, we validate the proposition that adding homophily (the propensity to interact with others of similar beliefs) into a society increases the sustainability of cooperation. However, this creates an evolutionary conflict between the accurate signalling of ingroup status versus the veridical report of the behaviour of other agents. We find that conditions exist where signalling ingroup status outweighs honesty as the best method to ultimately spread cooperation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The watching network-based recommendations, which use a much smaller size of user data, produces suggestions that are as good as the conventional Collaborative Filtering technique. The results demonstrate that the watching network is a useful information source and a feasible foundation for information personalization.

This paper is an investigation of retention in the popular community blogging platform \"Blogster.\" We use the points users earn for their activities as a proxy of retention and explore the attributes that are associated with their retention. We find that highly retained users are most central in the network and their blogger friends are mutually less connected. They get more views and comments to their posted blogs. We also examine the homophily of retention in the social network. Based on our empirical observations, we build a classifier that is able to detect top retained users with accuracy as high as 94%.

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Characterizing user pair relationships is important for applications such as friend recommendation and interest targeting in online social networks (OSNs). Due to the large-scale nature of such networks, it is infeasible to enumerate all user pairs and thus sampling is used. In this article, we show that it is a great challenge for OSN service providers to characterize user pair relationships, even when they possess the complete graph topology. The reason is that when sampling techniques (i.e., uniform vertex sampling (UVS) and random walk (RW)) are naively applied, they can introduce large biases, particularly for estimating similarity distribution of user pairs with constraints like existence of mutual neighbors, which is important for applications such as identifying network homophily. Estimating statistics of user pairs is more challenging in the absence of the complete topology information, as an unbiased sampling technique like UVS is usually not allowed and exploring the OSN graph topology is expensive. To address these challenges, we present unbiased sampling methods to characterize user pair properties based on UVS and RW techniques. We carry out an evaluation of our methods to show their accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we apply our methods to three OSNs-Foursquare, Douban, and Xiami-and discover that significant homophily is present in these networks."

The study also adopts a longitudinal design to examine how the roles of the three mechanisms evolve over time. The data involve citation exchanges in Internet research among 680 journals in 12 subject areas from 2000 to 2013. Assortative mixing by discipline and publication foci is a significant tie-generative mechanism in journal citation networks. The magnitude of as sortative mixing by discipline remains stable over time, whereas that by publication foci declines over time. Journals in Internet research demonstrate an increasing preference for influential journals to form citation links over time. The indegree of journals does not exert a significant impact on citation link formation among journals, whereas the outdegree of journals imposes a significantly negative impact on citation link formation among journals. Triadic closure is an important force that facilitates the formation of citation links among journals. The findings of this study improve our knowledge of the organizing principles that underlie journal citation networks and advance our understanding of the production process of scientific knowledge in Internet research.

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Multinational construction and engineering companies are increasingly adopting communities of practice (COPs), as a means to encourage geographically dispersed and culturally diverse professionals to share knowledge on a global basis. If successful, these COPs form rich, knowledge sharing networks; they mobilize a company's global knowledge base, allowing expertise to be applied when and where it is needed with relatively little managerial oversight. Conversely, geographic and cultural silos within COPs may form due to homophily, the social tendency of individuals to connect with similar others. These silos limit knowledge flows and curb the strategic advantage of a global workforce. Through empirical analysis of social network questionnaires and semistructured interviews, the research reported in this paper analyzed network patterns within three COPs to determine if geographic and cultural silos exist, identify structural patterns that defy homophilous trends, and explore why these network-level patterns exist. The research reported in this paper found that, in the absence of intentional organizational structuring and strategic control, silos induced by homophilious behavior were standard for global communities of practice. To encourage knowledge exchange across geographic and cultural boundaries, managers can create mutual task requirements, provide opportunities for connection through integrated training and learning experiences, and encourage workforce mobility among different geographic and cultural locations.

    "Abs": "Innovation contests allow firms to harness specialized skills and services from globally dispersed participants for solutions to business problems. Such contests provide a rich setting for operations management (OM) scholars to explore problem solving in global labor markets as firms continue to unbundle their innovation value chains. In this study, we examine the implications of specific types of diversity in innovation contests on problem-solving effort and success. First, we conceptualize diversity among contestants in terms of national wealth (measured as gross domestic product per capita (GDPP) adjusted for purchasing power parity) and national culture (measured using the culture dimensions of performance orientation and uncertainty avoidance) and examine how such factors influence problem-solving effort. Next, we examine how differences between contestants and contest holders in terms of the above factors influence contest outcomes. Using data from a popular online innovation contest platform and country-level archival data, we find that contestants from countries with lower levels of GDPP are more likely to exert greater problem-solving effort compared to other contestants. With regard to national culture, we find that performance orientation and uncertainty avoidance have positive and negative effects, respectively, each of which weakens with increasing levels of GDPP. Finally, our analysis provides evidence of homophily effects indicating that contestants who share greater similarities with the contest holder in terms of national wealth and national culture are more likely to be successful in a contest. We discuss the implications of the study's findings for contest holders and platform owners who organize innovation contests, and for emerging research on innovation contests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Social networks are said to have a positive impact on scientific development. Conventionally, it is argued that female and male researchers differ in access to and participation in networks and hence experience unequal career opportunities. Due to limited capacities of time and resources as well as homophily, top-level scientists may structure their contacts to reduce problems of complexity and uncertainty. The outcomes of the structuring can be cohesive subgroups within networks of relation. Women in science might suffer exclusion from cliques because of being dissimilar in the arena. The present paper aims to explore integration in and composition of scientific cliques. A three-step analysis is conducted: Firstly, cliques are identified. Secondly, overlap structures are examined. Thirdly, group compositions are analysed in terms of other personal attributes of the researchers involved. Building on network data of female and male investigators, the article applies a comparative case study design including two cutting edge research institutions from the German Excellence Initiative. The study contrasts a Cluster of Excellence with a Graduate School and the corresponding formal with the informal networks. The results imply that the general hypothesis of unfavourably embedded female researchers cannot be supported. Although women are less integrated in scientific cliques, the majority is involved in an inner social circle which enables access to career-relevant network resources."

In this paper, we investigate how to exploit homophily and social status in trust prediction by modeling social theories. We first give several methods to compute homophily coefficient and status coefficient, then provide a principled way to model trust prediction mathematically, and propose a novel framework, hsTrust, which incorporates homophily theory and status theory. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further experiments are conducted to understand the importance of homophily theory and status theory in trust prediction."

While the three are mutually supportive, perceived social distance and offline contacts had greater explanatory value than online contacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Chemical space networks (CSNs) have recently been introduced as a conceptual alternative to coordinate-based representations of chemical space. CSNs were initially designed as threshold networks using the Tanimoto coefficient as a continuous similarity measure. The analysis of CSNs generated from sets of bioactive compounds revealed that many statistical properties were strongly dependent on their edge density. While it was difficult to compare CSNs at pre-defined similarity threshold values, CSNs with constant edge density were directly comparable. In the current study, alternative CSN representations were constructed by applying the matched molecular pair (MMP) formalism as a substructure-based similarity criterion. For more than 150 compound activity classes, MMP-based CSNs (MMP-CSNs) were compared to corresponding threshold CSNs (THR-CSNs) at a constant edge density by applying different parameters from network science, measures of community structure distributions, and indicators of structure-activity relationship (SAR) information content. MMP-CSNs were found to be an attractive alternative to THR-CSNs, yielding low edge densities and well-resolved topologies. MMP-CSNs and corresponding THR-CSNs often had similar topology and closely corresponding community structures, although there was only limited overlap in similarity relationships. The homophily principle from network science was shown to affect MMP-CSNs and THR-CSNs in different ways, despite the presence of conserved topological features. Moreover, activity cliff distributions in alternative CSN designs markedly differed, which has important implications for SAR analysis."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "The transitivity property of trust enables the propagation of a trust value through a chain of trusting users in social networks and then provides an expected trust value for another user. Logically, a user in social networks can assess a large number of other users, even if two users have not been directly connected previously. However, a large percentage of trust propagation efforts fail to find reliable trust paths from a source user to a target user because the web of trust in real-world online social networks is too sparse. The success (both quality and quantity) of a trust propagation algorithm strongly relies on the density of a web of trust. The more trust paths that are able to reach the given target user, the more reliable will be the trust estimates based on the trust path with the highest strength. In this paper, we propose an enriched trust propagation approach by combining a homophily-based trust network with an expertise-based trust network, which enhances the density of the trust network. We then evaluate the prediction accuracy and coverage of trust propagation based on various aggregation methods and highlight the most promising method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Many software projects are no longer done in-house by a single organization. Instead, we are in a new age where software is developed by a networked community of individuals and organizations, which base their relations to each other on mutual interest. Paradoxically, recent research suggests that software development can actually be jointly-developed by rival firms. For instance, it is known that the mobile-device makers Apple and Samsung kept collaborating in open source projects while running expensive patent wars in the court. Taking a case study approach, we explore how rival firms collaborate in the open source arena by employing a multi-method approach that combines qualitative analysis of archival data (QA) withmining software repositories (MSR) and Social Network Analysis (SNA). While exploring collaborative processes within the OpenStack ecosystem, our research contributes to Software Engineering research by exploring the role of groups, sub-communities and business models within a high-networked open source ecosystem. Surprising results point out that competition for the same revenue model (i.e., operating conflicting business models) does not necessary affect collaboration within the ecosystem. Moreover, while detecting the different sub-communities of the OpenStack community, we found out that the expected social tendency of developers to work with developers from same firm (i.e., homophony) did not hold within the OpenStack ecosystem. Furthermore, while addressing a novel, complex and unexplored open source case, this research also contributes to the management literature in coopetition strategy and high-tech entrepreneurship with a rich description on how heterogeneous actors within a high-networked ecosystem (involving individuals, startups, established firms and public organizations) joint-develop a complex infrastructure for big-data in the open source arena."

    "Abs": "With the rapid development of social media applications, lots of users are connected with friends online, and their daily life and opinions are recorded. Social media provides us an unprecedented way to collect and analyze billions of users' information. Proper user attribute identification or profile inference becomes increasingly attractive and feasible. However, the flourishing social records also pose great challenge in effective feature selection and integration for user profile inference, which is mainly caused by the text diversity and complex community structures. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework to infer the user occupation from his/her social activities recorded in the micro-blog system, which is a multi-source integration framework that combines both content and network information. We first identify some beneficial content features, and propose a machine learning classification model, named content model. We proceed to exploit the social network information, which tailors a community discovery based latent dimension solution to extract community-based feature, and utilizes the neighbor predictions for inference updating. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on a large real-life micro-blog dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our integrated model for the occupation inference task, verify the effect of homophily in user interaction records, and reveal different effects of heterogeneous interactive networks."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Collaborative recommendation has attracted various research works in recent years. However, an important problem setting, i.e., \"a user examined several items but only rated a few\", has not received much attention yet. We coin this problem heterogeneous collaborative recommendation (HCR) from the perspective of users' heterogeneous feedbacks of implicit examinations and explicit ratings. In order to fully exploit such different types of feedbacks, we propose a novel and generic solution called compressed knowledge transfer via factorization machine (CKT-FM). Specifically, we assume that the compressed knowledge of user homophily and item correlation, i.e., user groups and item sets behind two types of feedbacks, are similar and then design a two-step transfer learning solution including compressed knowledge mining and integration. Our solution is able to transfer high quality knowledge via noise reduction, to model rich pairwise interactions among individual-level and cluster-level entities, and to adapt the potential inconsistent knowledge from implicit feedbacks to explicit feedbacks. Furthermore, the analysis on time complexity and space complexity shows that our solution is much more efficient than the state-of-the-art method for heterogeneous feedbacks. Extensive empirical studies on two large data sets show that our solution is significantly better than the state-of-the-art non-transfer learning method w.r.t. recommendation accuracy, and is much more efficient than that of leveraging the raw implicit examinations directly instead of compressed knowledge w.r.t. CPU time and memory usage. Hence, our CKT-FM strikes a good balance between effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge transfer in HCR. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

There is increasing interest in understanding the factors that affect the speed of social mobilization. Based on the Langley Knights competition data set, we analyzed the differences in mobilization speed between users of Facebook and e-mail. We include other factors that may influence mobilization speed (gender, age, timing, and homophily of information source) in our model as control variables in order to isolate the effect of such factors. We show that, in this experiment, although more people used e-mail to recruit, the mobilization speed of Facebook users was faster than that of those that used e-mail. We were also able to measure and show that the mobilization speed for Facebook users was on average seven times faster compared to e-mail before controlling for other factors. After controlling for other factors, we show that Facebook users were 1.84 times more likely to register compared to e-mail users in the next period if they have not done so at any point in time. This finding could provide useful insights for future social mobilization efforts."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Recommendation systems are popular both commercially and in the research community. For example, Online in Social Networks (OSNs) like Twitter, they are gaining an increasing attention since a lot of connection are established between users without any previous knowledge. This highlights one of the key features of a lot of OSNs: the creation of relationships between users. Therefore, it is important to find new ways to provide interesting friendships suggestions. However, mining and analyzing data from large scale Social Networks can become critical in terms of computational resources. This is particularly true in the context of ubiquitous access, where resource-constrained mobile devices are used to access the social network services. To this end, designing architectures/solutions offering the possibility of operating in a Mobile Cloud scenario is of key importance. Accordingly, we present a new recommendation system scheme that tries to find the right trade-offs between the exploitation of the already existing links/relationships and the interest affinities between users. In particular, such scheme is based on an inherently parallel Hubs And Authorities algorithm together with similarity measures that, for scalability purposes, can be easily transposed in a cloud scenario. The first one let us leverage triadic closures while the second one takes into account homophily. The proposal is supported by an extensive performance analysis on publicly available Twitter data. In particular, we proved the effectiveness of the proposed recommendation system by using several performance metrics available in the literature which include precision, recall, F-measure and G-measure. The results show encouraging perspectives in terms of both effectiveness and scalability, that are driving our future research efforts."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Incorporating the influence of social relationships effectively is fundamental to social recommendation (SR). However, most of the SR algorithms are based on the homophily assumption, where they ignored friends' different influence on users and users' different willingness to be influenced, which may make improper influence information integrated and harm the recommendation results. To address this, we propose a unified framework to properly incorporate the influence of social relationships into recommendation by the guidance of buddy (friends who have strong influence on user) and susceptibility (the willingness to be influenced) mining. Specifically, the Social Influence Propagation (SIP) method is proposed to identify each user's buddies and susceptibility and the Social Influence based Recommendation model is proposed to generate the final recommendation. Experiments on the real-world data demonstrate that the proposed framework can better utilize users' social relationships, resulting in increased recommendation accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Homophily and social influence are the main explanations for why there are more ties among people who have similar socio-demographic or behavioral characteristics. Homophily refers to the phenomenon that people are more likely to make relational ties with others who are similar to themselves than those who are not, whereas social influence refers to the phenomenon that an individual's behavior is likely to become more similar to that of her friends over time. It is important to study both homophily and social influence processes of a social network because each process can lead to different structural characteristics for a social network; homophily can lead to separation among the members of a network, whereas social influence can lead to network-wide uniformity. In this study, we examine homophily and social influence processes among online casual game players. Specifically, we ask whether an online casual game player tends to be friends with other online casual game players who have similar game genre preferences and whether a player's genre preferences and gaming frequencies become more similar to those of her Kongregate friends over time. For this study, demographic attributes, game genre preferences, gaming frequencies, and relational ties for 2488 game players were collected for two time periods from Kongregate. The panel data were analyzed with RSiena, the R version of SIENA (Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis), a social network analysis program used for social network panel data. The results suggest that there might not be strong homophily and social influence processes operating among the game players in the sampled network. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

    "Abs": "YouTube is a successful social network that people use to upload, watch, and comment on videos. We believe comments left on these videos can provide insight into user interests, but to this point have not been used to map out a specific video community. Our study investigates whether and how user commenting behavior impacts the topology of the K-pop video community through analysis of co-commenting behavior on these videos. We apply a traditional author cocitation analysis to this behavior, in a process we refer to as co-comment analysis, to detect the topology of this community. This involves: a) an analysis of user co-comments to elicit the inclination of user homophily within the community; b) an analysis of user co-comments, weighted frequency of co-comments, to detect user interests in the community; and c) an analysis of user co-comments, weighted sentiment scores, to capture user opinions by polarity. The results indicate that users who comment on specific K-pop videos also tend to comment on topically similar YouTube videos. We also find that the number of comments made by users correlates with the degree of positivity of their comments. Conversely, users who comment negatively on K-pop videos are not inclined to form specific user groups, but rather present only their opinions individually."

We then study the performance of different machine learning (ML) methods to predict demographic features (namely, age and gender) of unlabeled users by leveraging individual calling patterns, as well as the structure of the communication graph. We show how a specific implementation of a diffusion model, harnessing the graph structure, has significantly better performance over other node-based standard ML methods. We provide details of the methodology together with an analysis of the robustness of our results to changes in the model parameters. Furthermore, by carefully examining the topological relations of the training nodes (seed nodes) to the rest of the nodes in the network, we find topological metrics which have a direct influence on the performance of the algorithm."

Often these algorithms introduce network properties in the model regardless of their social interpretation resulting in networks which are statistically similar but structurally different from real world networks. In this paper, we focus on social networks and apply concepts of social ties, homophily and extraversion-introversion to develop a model for social networks with small world and scale free properties. We claim that the proposed model produces networks which are structurally similar to real world social networks."

One facet of any discipline's identity is the social aspect of how its scholars actually conduct their work (DeSanctis 2003), which is formally labeled as the study of sociology of science. Contributing to this tradition of work, we empirically examine scholarly influence (Acedo et al., 2006); scientific collaboration, including metrics that capture the prevalence of c-oauthored work; antecedents to co-authorship; and the effect of co-authorship on subsequent citations. Based on analyzing five leading IS journals for a period of seven years, we found that co-authored papers have become increasingly common in leading IS journals and that coauthoring continues to be more prevalent in journals published in North America compared to European journals. Moreover, we found significant effects of homophily related to gender, homophily/proximity, and geography. IS scholars worldwide exhibit a stronger preference for collaborating with co-authors of the same sex and those who attended the same PhD program than one would expect by chance. We also examined differences among journals and found some intriguing results for the effect of co-authorship on citations. Overall, we found evidence that the number of co-authors was positively related to citations although there was some variance across journals. These findings point to a need for more research to better understand both the processes of collaboration and the drivers and downstream benefits associated with it."

The results explore three themes sociability and design; group membership; norms and rules and show how on-and offline are inexorably linked through the social organizational demands of Internet gaming. Individuals ground online group membership in offline relations and shared characteristics, aiming to maximize game-play gains and support sociability. Gaming with 'people like us' facilitates creation of norms and expectations, which aids in producing stable social groups. Thus the boundary between online and offline becomes contingent on links between people. The study shows how important offline connections are for online interaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the main problems in analyzing these networks is the problem of predicting the existence of links between users on these networks: the link prediction problem. Many studies have been conducted to predict links using a variety of techniques like the decision tree and the logistic regression approaches. In this work, we will illustrate the use of the rough set theory in predicting links over the Facebook social network based on homophilic features. Other supervised learning algorithms are also employed in our experiments and compared with the rough set classifier, such as naive Bayes, J48 decision tree, support vector machine, logistic regression, and multilayer perceptron neural network. Moreover, we studied the influence of the \"common groups\" and \"common page likes\" homophilic features on predicting friendship between users of Facebook, and also studied the effect of using the Jaccard coefficient in measuring the similarity between users' homophilic attributes compared with using the overlap coefficient. We conducted our experiments on two different datasets obtained from the Facebook online social network, where users in each dataset live within the same geographical region. The results showed that the rough set classifier significantly outperformed the other classifiers in all experiments. The results also demonstrated that the common groups and the common page likes features have a significant influence on predicting the friendship between users of Facebook. Finally, the results revealed that using the overlap coefficient homophilic features provided better results than that of the Jaccard coefficient features."

We investigate the interplay of homophily, rejection, and in-group cooperation drivers on the formation of opinion clusters and the emergence of extremist, radical opinions. Our model is the first to explicitly explore the effect of in-group favoritism on the macro-level, collective behavior of opinions. We compare our model against the two-dimentional bounded confidence model with rejection mechanism, proposed by Huet et al. [Adv. Complex Syst. 13(3) (2010) 405423], and find that the number of opinion clusters and extremists is reduced in our model.

The gratitude intervention had been previously shown to increase positive affect and decrease negative affect in an individual but dynamic group effects have not been considered. In the first study, the intervention was administered to the whole network. In the second study, two social networks are considered and in each only a subset of individuals, initially low/high in negative affect respectively received the intervention as \"agents of change\". Data was analyzed using stochastic actor-based modeling techniques to identify resulting network changes, impact on positive and negative affect and potential contagion of mood within the group. The first study found a group level increase in positive and a decrease in negative affect. Homophily was detected with regard to positive and negative affect but no evidence of contagion was found. The network itself became more volatile along with a fall in rate of change of negative affect. Centrality measures indicated that the best broadcasters were the individuals with the least negative affect levels at the beginning of the study. In the second study, the positive and negative affect levels for the whole group depended on the initial levels of negative affect of the intervention recipients. There was evidence of positive affect contagion in the group where intervention recipients had low initial level of negative affect and contagion in negative affect for the group where recipients had initially high level of negative affect."

Specifically, (1) from the buyers' perspective, they are more likely to follow other buyers and sellers through observational learning and contagion; (2) from the sellers' perspective, the homophily, reciprocity, and structural equivalence are the general mechanisms that drive them following both buyers and sellers; (3) the results from the robustness checks show that the findings would not be affected by the sample size or the duration of the observations.This study contributes to the ongoing study of social networks analysis in social shopping and social commerce. Furthermore, the ties studied in this research connect both sellers and buyers, which are different from the ties of friendship in most social network literatures.

This research seeks to investigate the level of accuracy of detection of personality in dating profile texts, and the extent to which perceived or actual similarity of personality has an effect on attractiveness of the author. An online survey was conducted collecting the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) for each participant and text author, a peer-report TIPI score by participants for each text author, and an attractiveness rating on a Likert scale for each author. Participants correctly identified Extraversion, though the effect size was small. Contrary to the hypotheses, participants preferred texts when written by an author with a personality they perceived as dissimilar to their own, specifically in Openness and Conscientiousness, and no relationship was found between actual similarity of personality and attractiveness. Online daters may choose partners with complementary or desirable traits rather than similar traits, or other factors in attraction may be more salient in the initial stages of determining attraction."

We do this by exploring the relationship between connectedness, social interactions and common life points on Facebook. The results are of particular importance for the development of technology that aims at reducing social isolation for people with less chances to interact, such as older adults."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Various network relationships in many complex social systems can be described effectively by multilayer networks, but we find that there are interactions between individuals attributes and their social relationships by a principle of homophily, which hence impact the process of information spread and social influence in complex social systems. In order to integrate individuals relationships and attributes in complex social systems effectively, we extract the hidden information of individuals attributes to build a relationships-attributes-based model of multi-layer networks. Proposing that using information entropy which satisfies the conditions of degree distribution and community features to evaluate information values for each network in the multilayer networks, we construct a more reasonable integrated network to solve the problems of data compression reduction of multilayer networks. In addition, we analyze the relationships-attributes-based multilayer networks from the perspectives of the structure of the multilayer networks and the structure of the integrated network on two empirical data. The results verify the correlation between attribute networks and relationship networks, and give more insights into the importance of the proposed relationships-attributes-based model of multilayer networks and the positive role of the integrated network in synthesizing the relationships-attributes-based multilayer networks."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Within real-world social networks people are linked with multiple types of relationships, which brings new challenges in community detection for multilayer social network where each layer represents one type of relationships. However, most of existing approaches consist on transforming the problem into a classical problem of community detection in monoplex network. In this work, we propose a new hybrid community detection approach in multilayer social networks. This approach considers simultaneously the network structure (different social connections) and the homophily of participants (similarities between users). To do so we propose a new multiplex information graph model to represent multilayer social network. Then, we adapt a combined community detection algorithm to the multiplex case. Furthermore, an example in the field of scientific collaboration recommendation is given to illustrate the practical usefulness of the proposed approach. Finally, a comparison with other community detection approaches evaluates its performance."

In this paper, we propose a user preference representation based on user activities embedded in unstructured data to better encode the homophily theory. The representation of an individual user is learned using a embedding based method to integrate latent user preferences in social media. The method has the ability to integrate a variety of user activities based cues from user comments, user social network (i.e; follower/followee connections) and user interested topics which are indicated by the topics a user has participated in. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the prediction of each user's favorite team as a part of user preferences in a dataset collected from the Hu-pu basketball discussion forum.(1) Results clearly indicate that our proposed user representation outperforms other user representation baselines. Integrating user social network and user interested topics with user comments can improve the overall performance of user preference prediction."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "The creation of social ties is driven by several factors which can arguably be related to individual preferences and to the common social environment of individuals. Effects of homophily and triadic closure mechanisms are claimed to be important in terms of initiating new social interactions and in turn to shape the global social structure. This way they eventually provide some potential to predict the creation of social ties between disconnected people sharing common friends or common subjects of interest. In this paper we analyze a large Twitter data corpus and quantify similarities between people by considering the set of their common friends and the set of their commonly shared hashtags in order to predict mention links among them. We show that these similarity measures are correlated among connected people and that the combination of contextual and local structural features provides better predictions as compared to cases where they are considered separately. These results help us to better understand the evolution of egocentric and global social networks and provide advances in the design of better recommendation systems and resource allocation plans."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Advances in social networking and communication technologies have witnessed an increasing number of applications where data is not only characterized by rich content information, but also connected with complex relationships representing social roles and dependencies between individuals. To enable knowledge discovery from such networked data, network representation learning (NRL) aims to learn vector representations for network nodes, such that off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms can be directly applied. To date, existing NRL methods either primarily focus on network structure or simply combine node content and topology for learning. We argue that in information networks, information is mainly originated from three sources: (1) homophily, (2) topology structure, and (3) node content. Homophily states social phenomenon where individuals sharing similar attributes (content) tend to be directly connected through local relational ties, while topology structure emphasizes more on global connections. To ensure effective network representation learning, we propose to augment three information sources into one learning objective function, so that the interplay roles between three parties are enforced by requiring the learned network representations (1) being consistent with node content and topology structure, and also (2) following the social homophily constraints in the learned space. Experiments on multi-class node classification demonstrate that the representations learned by the proposed method consistently outperform state-of-the-art NRL methods, especially for very sparsely labeled networks."

Using Gowalla data with 385,306 users, 3 million locations, and 35 million check-in records, we empirically estimate the model to find evidence on the homophily effect on network formation. To cope with possible endogeneity issues, we use exogenous weather shocks as our instrumental variables and find the empirical results are robust: network formation decisions are significantly affected by our proximity measures."

    "Abs": "Regional prejudice is prevalent in Chinese cities where native residents and migrants from other parts of China lack mutual trust. Weibo users actively discuss and argue about the issue of migration, which provides a good source of data to examine the communication network regarding regional prejudice. We are interested in the posts and reposts related to the topic on migrants. In a Weibo repost, one can add new content in addition to the original post. Then both original and new content as a whole can be read by others. In particular, we focus on the reposts in response to native residents' complaints about migrants. Based on the sentiment (negative or non-negative) and the direction (native resident -> migrant or migrant -> native resident), we classify the reposts into four categories. We find evidence of homophily in regional prejudice in the Weibo communication network: 72.7% of the time, native residents' complaints trigger more complaints from other native residents. What interests us most are the socioeconomic factors that can reverse the sentiment or direction of the original posts. A multinomial regression model of the reposting patterns reveals that in a city with better housing security and a larger migrant population, migrant Weibo users are much more likely to argue with native residents who hold a negative view about migrants. One important implication from our findings is that a secure socioeconomic environment facilitates the communication between migrants and native residents and helps break the self-reinforcing loop of regional prejudice."

How information spreads has commonly been analysed from the perspective of homophily, social influence, and initial seed selection. However, in virtual worlds and virtual economies, the movements of information and goods can be precisely tracked. Therefore, these environments create laboratories for the accurate study of information diffusion characteristics that have been difficult to study in prior research. In this paper, we study how content visibility as well as sender and receiver characteristics, the relationship between them, and the types of multilayer social network layers affect content absorption and diffusion in virtual world. The results show that prior visibility of distributed content is the strongest predictor of content adoption and its further spread across networks. Among other analysed factors, the mechanics of diffusion, content quality, and content adoption by users' neighbours on the social activity layer had very strong influences on the adoption of new content."

    "Abs": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of the relationship between a scholar's research performance (using weighted journal-impact factor average) and their degree centrality; the impact of author-homophily (in terms of gender, institutional sector, academic age, academic ranks, province and city) on this relationship is investigated as well.Design/methodology/approach - Using scientific publishing data and journal-impact factors from Thomson Reuters' ISI Web of Science (SCI) and Journal Citation Reports, respectively, the domestic co-authorship network of chemistry researchers in Pakistan during 2002-2009 was constructed then modeled via ordinary least squares regression.Findings - Results show that the personal characteristics of a researcher do not necessarily lead to high degree centrality, i. e. attributes may not be causal to co-author relationships. Instead, high degree centrality is more so a function of the forerunning research performance of the researcher: those whom publish more in terms of impact factor, attract more co-authors (high degree centrality). Moreover, the relationship between research performance and degree centrality is positively moderated by age and province homophily and negatively moderated by city homophily.Research limitations/implications - Data are sourced wholly from the Pakistani chemistry research community; results many not be generalizable to other sub-populations or the wider research community.Practical implications - The findings provide insights to performance-seeking authors: knowing that their research performance enhances their centrality, which in-turn may lead to increased research performance and various other desirable professional outcomes. In addition, researchers can look toward establishing similar (homophilous) or dissimilar (heterophilous) ties knowing that the relationship between research performance and centrality will likely be stronger when similarity or dissimilarity exists.Social implications - This study supports the idea that high research performance attracts more potential co-authors, which in-turn may lead to ever greater research performance, which suggests that the research community will be fragmented between high-and low-performing researchers. Also researcher will have similar or dissimilar ties in terms of various characteristics which in turn moderate the research performance centrality relationship.Originality/value - This paper counteracts the empirical belief that researchers are attractive as potential co-authors according to their personal and professional characteristics. It is actually their research performance and homophily or heterophily of their ties which matters."

Some of the most fundamental human characteristics are reflected by an individual's personality, which represents a persistent disposition governing a human's outlook and approach to diverse situations. While taking into account demographics of age and gender, we assess the extent to which personality homophily is evident in the local network features of Facebook. Using a large sample obtained from the MyPersonality dataset, we find that a range of network-based features correlate with personality facets of individuals. In particular, extraversion had a positive effect on an individual's network size, while neuroticism had a negative effect. Additionally, extraversion and openness were positively related to transitivity, which was moderated by gender. Finally, we found that conscientiousness, agreeableness and extraversion were homophilous: people with higher similarity on these facets were more strongly connected. This was additionally mediated by gender for agreeableness: personality similarity had an effect for male-only and mixed pairs, but not for female-only pairs. Personality similarity was also stronger among closed triangles, compared to open ones. These results support the idea that inherent attraction between individuals, on the basis of personality, drives the roles we play within our online social networks."

Homophily in social networks is a vital contributor for analyzing patterns for medical conditions, diagnosis and treatment options. Since, members with similar medical issues contribute to a common discussion pool; this offers a rich source of information that can be utilized. This paper intends to explore growing trends in Mental Health and Behavioral Studies (MHB) which lays emphasis on co-existing conditions resulting in comorbidity. We present a novel approach where personality traits inferred from unstructured text of patients and general social users are compared via statistical analysis. This is achieved by our Psychiatric Disorder Determination (PDD) algorithm. Further, Social media data of users showing personality traits of patients is subjected to semantic based text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Ontology Based Information Extraction (OBIE) in our Addiction Category Determination (ACD) algorithm. This provides categorization of user journals to common topics of discussion by referring to ontologies DBpedia, Freebase and YAGO2s. The final category hence obtained can be predicted to be a trending subject of concern for users with Psychiatric disorders developing Addictive behavioral personalities."

    "Abs": "Many online social networks thrive on automatic sharing of friends' activities to a user through activity feeds, which may influence the user's next actions. However, identifying such social influence is tricky because these activities are simultaneously impacted by influence and homophily. We propose a statistical procedure that uses commonly available network and observational data about people's actions to estimate the extent of copy-influence-mimicking others' actions that appear in a feed. We assume that non-friends don't influence users; thus, comparing how a user's activity correlates with friends versus non-friends who have similar preferences can help tease out the effect of copy-influence.Experiments on datasets from multiple social networks show that estimates that don't account for homophily overestimate copy-influence by varying, often large amounts. Further, copy-influence estimates fall below 1% of total actions in all networks: most people, and almost all actions, are not affected by the feed. Our results question common perceptions around the extent of copy-influence in online social networks and suggest improvements to diffusion and recommendation models."

Many efforts to make people connect with those who think differently have not worked well. In this paper, we hypothesize, first, that previous approaches have not worked because they have been direct - they have tried to explicitly connect people with those having opposing views on sensitive issues. Second, that neither recommendation or presentation of information by themselves are enough to encourage behavioral change. We propose a platform that mixes a recommender algorithm and a visualization-based user interface to explore recommendations. It recommends politically diverse profiles in terms of distance of latent topics, and displays those recommendations in a visual representation of each user's personal content. We performed an \"in the wild\" evaluation of this platform, and found that people explored more recommendations when using a biased algorithm instead of ours. In line with our hypothesis, we also found that the mixture of our recommender algorithm and our user interface, allowed politically interested users to exhibit an unbiased exploration of the recommended profiles. Finally, our results contribute insights in two aspects: first, which individual differences are important when designing platforms aimed at behavioral change; and second, which algorithms and user interfaces should be mixed to help users avoid cognitive mechanisms that lead to biased behavior."

We demonstrate an integrated database-driven recommendation approach that determines reciprocal user matches, which is an important feature to reduce the risk of rejection. Similarity is computed in a data-adaptive way based on dimensions such as homophily, propinquity, and recommendation context. By representation of dimensions as unique preference database queries, user models can be created in an intuitive way and can be directly evaluated on datasets. Query results serve as input for a reciprocal recommendation process that handles various similarity measures. Performance benchmarks conducted with data of a commercial outdoor platform prove the applicability to reallife tasks."

The huge data in social networks has increased the risk of false discoveries, identifying communities in Facebook requires simple but effective fast techniques. Existing community detection methods suffer from high computational cost caused by both huge structure (nodes) and attribute dimensionality.Based on the homophily property of social networks, that linked nodes likely share similar attributes, we propose a new approach to rank attributes of a social network, called RELNA. Then we detect communities using only high ranked attributes instead of all, therefore, the computation time can be reduced dramatically. Comparisons between RELNA and LINKREC (a well-known attribute ranking algorithm) were made through experiments on Facebook data sets, the results are almost the same. Furthermore, we use the obtained top relevant attributes on CESNA algorithm (an well known overlapping community detection algorithm) to detect communities, results show that our approach is much faster meanwhile cluster precision keeps almost the same as CESNA."

In our model, every group member is characterized by his opinion, which is represented as a point on the real line. The group evolves in discrete time steps through a voting process carried out by the group's members. Due to homophily, each member votes for the candidate who is more similar to him (i.e., closer to him on the line). An admission rule is then applied to determine which candidate, if any, is admitted. We consider several natural admission rules including majority and consensus.We ask: how do different admission rules affect the composition of the group in the long term? We study both growing groups (where new members join old ones) and fixed-size groups (where new members replace those who quit). Our analysis reveals intriguing phenomena and phase transitions, some of which are quite counterintuitive."

    "Abs": "With the continuing urbanisation of the world's population, the risk of economic, health and environmental disaster is also increasing. There is an urgent demand for urban planners and governments to understand how people use the city's infrastructure. Recently, as cell phones become more popular, mobile phone data provides an unlimited source of information about the city. In this paper, we build a social network between different base stations and analyse how the places are connected by using a four-day mobile phone dataset, which consists of 17,598,000 records. Particularly, we construct communication network between different parts of the city and analyse the degree distribution of the network and the homophily of the administrative areas. We then use Louvain method to detect the community structure of the network on weekdays and weekends. Our results show that the in-degree and out-degree distribution of the network exhibit a heavy-tailed form and the assortativity by administrative area is strong. The communities found on weekdays and weekends are both spatially contiguous, which implies that whether at work or not, people tend to communicate within a spatially enclosed community."

    "Title": "Sympatric Multiculturalism in Opinion Models",
    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "While social interactions tend to decrease differences in opinions, multiplicity of groups and individual opinion differences persist in human societies. Axelrod identified homophily and social conformity seeking as basic interactions that can lead to multiculturalism in spatial scenarios in models under certain special conditions. We follow another route, where the social interaction between any two agents is given by the descent along the gradient of a cost function deduced from a Bayesian learning formalism. The cost function depends on a hyperparameter that estimates the trust of one agent in the information provided by the other. If the expected value of the total cost function is relevant information, Maximum Entropy permits characterizing the state of the society. Furthermore we introduce a dynamics on the trust parameters, which increases when agents concur and decreases otherwise. We study the resulting phase diagram in the case of large number of interacting agents on a complete social graph, hence under sympatric conditions. Simulations show that there is evolution of assortative distrust in rich cultural environments measured by the diversity of the set of issues under discussions. High distrust leads to antilearning which leads to multiple groups which hold different opinions on the set of issues. We simulate conditions of political pressure and interaction that describe the House of Congress of Brazil and are able to qualitatively replicate voting patterns through four presidential cycles during the years of 1994 to 2010."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Summarizing patterns of connections or social ties in a social network, in terms of attributes information on nodes and edges, holds a key to the understanding of how the actors interact and form relationships. We formalize this problem as mining top-k group relationships (GRs), which captures strong social ties between groups of actors. While existing works focus on patterns that follow from the well known homophily principle, we are interested in social ties that do not follow from homophily, thus, provide new insights. Finding top-k GRs faces new challenges: it requires a novel ranking metric because traditional metrics favor patterns that are expected from the homophily principle; it requires an innovative search strategy since there is no obvious anti-monotonicity for such GRs; it requires a novel data structure to avoid data explosion caused by multidimensional nodes and edges and many-to-many relationships in a social network. We address these issues through presenting an efficient algorithm, GRMiner, for mining top-k GRs and we evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency using real data."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Social networks are an important class of networks that span a wide variety of media, ranging from social websites such as Facebook and Google Plus, citation networks of academic papers and patents, caller networks in telecommunications, and hyperlinked document collections such as Wikipedia - to name a few. Many of these social networks now exceed millions of users or actors, each of which may be associated with rich attribute data such as user profiles in social websites and caller networks, or subject classifications in document collections and citation networks. Such attribute data is often incomplete for a number of reasons - for example, users may be unwilling to spend the effort to complete their profiles, while in the case of document collections, there may be insufficient human labor to accurately classify all documents. At the same time, the tie or link information in these networks may also be incomplete - in social websites, users may simply be unaware of potential acquaintances, while in citation networks, authors may be unaware of appropriate literature that should be referenced.Completing and predicting these missing attributes and ties is important to a spectrum of applications, such as recommendation, personalized search, and targeted advertising, yet large social networks can pose a scalability challenge to existing algorithms designed for this task. Towards this end, we propose an integrative probabilistic model, SLR, that captures both attribute and tie information simultaneously, and can be used for attribute completion and tie prediction, in order to enable the above mentioned applications. A key innovation in our model is the use of triangle motifs to represent ties in the network, in order to scale to networks with millions of nodes and beyond. Experiments on real world datasets show that SLR significantly improves the accuracy of attribute prediction and tie prediction compared to well-known methods, and our distributed, multi-machine implementation easily scales up to millions of users. In addition to fast and accurate attribute and tie prediction, we also demonstrate how SLR can identify the attributes most responsible for homophily within the network, thus revealing which attributes drive network tie formation."

Social circles are inferable from those relations and there are already solutions to find the underlying sentiment of social interactions. We present an empirical study that combines existing Graph Clustering and Sentiment Analysis techniques for reasoning about Sentiment dynamics at cluster level and analyzing the role of social influence on sentiment contagion, based on a large dataset extracted from Twitter during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Exploiting WebGraph and LAW frameworks to extract clusters, and SentiStrength to analyze sentiment, we propose a strategy for finding moments of Sentiment Homophily in clusters. We found that clusters tend to be neutral for long ranges of time, but denote volatile bursts of sentiment polarity locally over time. In those moments of polarized sentiment homogeneity there is evidence of an increased, but not strong, chance of one sharing the same overall sentiment that prevails in the cluster to which he belongs."

    "Abs": "Entity Resolution (ER) is the process of identifying references referring to the same entity from one or more data sources. In the ER process, most existing approaches exploit the content information of references, categorized as content-based ER, or additionally consider linkage information among references, categorized as context-based ER. However, in new applications of ER, such as in the genealogical domain, the very limited linkage information among references results in a disjoint graph in which the existing content-/context-based ER techniques have very limited applicability. Therefore, in this paper we propose first, to use the homophily principle for augmentation of the original input graph by connecting the potential similar references, and second, to use a Random Walk based approach to consider contextual information available for each reference in the augmented graph. We evaluate the proposed method by applying it to a large genealogical dataset and we succeed to predict 420,000 reference matches with precision 92% and discover six novel and informative patterns among them which can not be detected in the original disjoint graph."

    "Abs": "In social media, trust and distrust among users are important factors in helping users make decisions, dissect information, and receive recommendations. However, the sparsity and imbalance of social relations bring great difficulties and challenges in predicting trust and distrust. Meanwhile, there are numerous inducing factors to determine trust and distrust relations. The relationship among inducing factors may be dependency, independence, and conflicting. Dempster-Shafer theory and neural network are effective and efficient strategies to deal with these difficulties and challenges. In this paper, we study trust and distrust prediction based on the combination of Dempster-Shafer theory and neural network. We firstly analyze the inducing factors about trust and distrust, namely, homophily, status theory, and emotion tendency. Then, we quantify inducing factors of trust and distrust, take these features as evidences, and construct evidence prototype as input nodes of multilayer neural network. Finally, we propose a framework of predicting trust and distrust which uses multilayer neural network to model the implementing process of Dempster-Shafer theory in different hidden layers, aiming to overcome the disadvantage of Dempster-Shafer theory without optimization method. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

Social learning refers to informal learning-from-others in daily works. Prior literature has shown benefits of social networks on individual learning.

We employed a comparative case study to identify key components of social learning and investigate the contingent effects of social networks on social learning in different organizational settings. Data obtained by interviewing 23 ERP users in two firms in China indicate that 1) social learning is a bidirectional process with two essential stages, 2) instrumental ties, position homophily, external ties, and centrality of ERP learning network are positively associated with social learning, and 3) expressive ties and rank homophily affect social learning contingently."

Each voter observes the ballots of her neighbors in the network, from which she infers the likely outcome of the election. Each voter may then revise her vote strategically, to maximize her expected utility. Our work focuses on plurality voting, where strategic voting is a major concern. We show that in practice, strategization increases with voter knowledge, yet can improve the social welfare for the population. Real world social networks exhibit a property called homophily; sometimes called \"The Echo Chamber Effect\", which is the tendency for friends to have similar ideologies. We find that homophily dampens the benefits of strategization, and correspondingly, lowers the frequency of its occurrence. This effect may contribute to the low number of strategic voters observed in real world elections. Additionally, strategization may lead to the elimination of less popular candidates, as voters revise their votes to less preferred but more hopeful candidates. This phenomenon is known as Duverger's Law in political science, and we show that it does not hold in certain network structures."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Nowadays, a modern e-commerce company may have both online sales and offline sales departments. Normally, online sales attempt to sell in small quantities to individual customers through broadcasting a large amount of emails or promotion codes, which heavily rely on the designed backend algorithms. Offline sales, on the other hand, try to sell in much larger quantities to enterprise customers through contacts initiated by sales representatives, which are more costly compared to online sales. Unlike many previous research works focusing on machine learning algorithms to support online sales, this paper introduces an approach that utilizes heterogenous social networks to improve the effectiveness of offline sales. More specifically, we propose a two-phase framework, HeteroSales, which first constructs a company-to-company graph, a.k.a. Company Homophily Graph (CHG), from semantics based meta-path learning, and then adopts label propagation on the graph to predict promising companies that we may successfully close an offline deal with. Based on the statistical analysis on the world's largest professional social network, LinkedIn, we demonstrate interesting discoveries showing that not all the social connections in a heterogeneous social network are useful in this task. In other words, some proper data preprocessing is essential to ensure the effectiveness of offline sales. Finally, through the experiments on LinkedIn social network data and third-party offline sales records, we demonstrate the power of HereroSales to identify potential enterprise customers in offline sales."

Accurate detection would enable many beneficial applications, such as alerting search users to controversy. Wikipedia's broad coverage and rich metadata offer a valuable resource for this problem. We hypothesize that intensities of controversy among related pages are not independent. Thus, we propose a stacked model which exploits the dependencies among related pages. Our approach improves classification of controversial web pages when compared to a model that examines each page in isolation, demonstrating that controversial topics exhibit homophily. Using notions of similarity to construct a subnetwork for collective classification, rather than using the default network present in the relational data, leads to improved classification with wider applications for semi-structured datasets, with the effects most pronounced when a small set of neighbors is used."

    "Abs": "Location-based social networks (LBSNs) have recently attracted a lot of attention due to the number of novel services they can offer. Prior work on analysis of LBSNs has mainly focused on the social part of these systems. Even though it is important to know how different the structure of the social graph of an LBSN is as compared to the friendship-based social networks (SNs), it raises the interesting question of what kinds of linkages exist between locations and friendships. The main problem we are investigating is to identify such connections between the social and the spatial planes of an LBSN. In particular, in this paper we focus on answering the following general question \"What are the bonds between the social and spatial information in an LBSN and what are the metrics that can reveal them?\" In order to tackle this problem, we employ the idea of affiliation networks. Analyzing a dataset from a specific LBSN (Gowalla), we make two main interesting observations; (i) the social network exhibits signs of homophily with regards to the \"places/venues\" visited by the users, and (ii) the \"nature\" of the visited venues that are common to users is powerful and informative in revealing the social/spatial linkages. We further show that the \"entropy\" of a venue can be used to better connect spatial information with the existing social relations. The entropy records the diversity of a venue and requires only location history of users (it does not need temporal history). Finally, we provide a simple application of our findings for predicting existing friendship relations based on users' historic spatial information. We show that even with simple unsupervised or supervised learning models we can achieve significant improvement in prediction when we consider features that capture the \"nature\" of the venue as compared to the case where only apparent properties of the location history are used (e.g., number of common visits).

Results about OSNs demonstrated that the relationships that an individual (ego) maintains with other people (alters) can be organized into a set of circles (named Dunbar's circles) according to the ego network model. The study of the impact of ego networks structure on the availability patterns of users is seriously limited by the lack of information about users availability patterns. In this work we contribute to fill this gap by analysing availability information of a sample of Facebook users. The data reveal a number of strong temporal dependencies (or temporal homophily) which provide insights into the availability pattern that characterize an ego network.

Hypotheses predicted that individuals with high social anxiety would demonstrate greater interpersonal connectedness following instant messaging conversations; whereas, individuals with low social anxiety would report greater interpersonal connectedness following face-to-face and phone conversations. Undergraduate participants (N = 165) were randomly assigned to one of three conversation mediums (face-to-face, phone or instant messaging) during which they engaged in an interaction with an unfamiliar partner. Participants completed a measure of social anxiety before the interaction and measures of interpersonal connectedness prior to and following the interaction. Results revealed that level of social anxiety is a significant contingent condition for the association between type of conversation medium and attitude homophily (i.e., a measure of interpersonal connectedness). For individuals with low social anxiety, scores on the attitude homophily measure were significantly lower in the instant messaging condition, compared to the face-to-face and phone conditions.

The opinion of each agent is represented by a sequence of arguments, and it evolves through the interactions between agents. The probability that one agent chooses another to communicate depends on the similarity of their opinions. During every interaction, interacting agents exchange the argument randomly selected from the corresponding arguments sequence. Theoretical analysis reveals that this model results in consensus on either extreme positive opinion or extreme negative opinion, or generates bi-polarization. Numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the dynamics of the model over different networks. Results are obtained in terms of the effect of homophily, biased assimilation and network topology on opinion formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "This paper studies two important signal processing aspects of homophilic behavior namely, detection of homophilic communities and the distributed coordination of meta-agents, which interact with the detected homophilic communities. First, the theory of revealed preferences from microeconomics is used to construct a nonparametric decision test for homophilic behavior using only the time series of external influences and associated agents' responses. These tests rely on rationalizing the dataset of agents' actions as the play from the Nash equilibrium of a concave potential game. A stochastic gradient algorithm is given to optimize the external influence signal in real time to minimize the Type-II error probabilities of the detection test subject to specified Type-I error probability. Using the decision test, methods are provided to detect for homophilic communities. Subsequently, a nonparametric algorithm is presented that uses the constructed potential function for the potential game to predict the preferences of the detected homophilic communities. Second, we present a non-cooperative game model for interaction of meta-agents that interact with the communities and propose an algorithm that prescribes meta-agents how to take actions based on the preference of the communities and past interaction information with other meta-agents. The proposed algorithm has two timescales: the slow timescale is the nonparametric preference learning presented in the first part, and the fast timescale is a regret-matching stochastic approximation algorithm. It is shown that, if all meta-agents follow the proposed algorithm, their collective behavior is attracted to the correlated equilibria set of the game. This means that meta-agents can co-ordinate their strategies in a distributed fashion as if there exists a centralized coordinating device that they all trust to follow. We provide a real-world example using the energy market, and a numerical example to detect malicious agents in an online social network."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Traditional post-level opinion classification methods usually fail to capture a person's overall sentiment orientation toward a topic from his/her microblog posts published for a variety of themes related to that topic. One reason for this is that the sentiments connoted in the textual expressions of microblog posts are often obscure. Moreover, a person's opinions are often influenced by his/her social network. This study therefore proposes a new method based on integrated information of microblog users' social interactions and textual opinions to infer the sentiment orientation of a user or the whole group regarding a hot topic. A Social Opinion Graph (SOG) is first constructed as the data model for sentiment analysis of a group of microblog users who share opinions on a topic. This represents their social interactions and opinions. The training phase then uses the SOGs of training sets to construct Sentiment Guiding Matrix (SGM), representing the knowledge about the correlation between users' sentiments, Textual Sentiment Classifier (TSC), and emotion homophily coefficients of the influence of various types of social interaction on users' mutual sentiments. All of these support a high-performance social sentiment analysis procedure based on the relaxation labeling scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better sentiment classification accuracy than the textual classification and other integrated classification methods. In addition, IMSA can reduce pre-annotation overheads and the influence from sampling deviation."

    "Abs": "Citation networks have been widely used to study the evolution of science through the lenses of the underlying patterns of knowledge flows among academic papers, authors, research sub-fields, and scientific journals. Here we focus on citation networks to cast light on the salience of homophily, namely the principle that similarity breeds connection, for knowledge transfer between papers. To this end, we assess the degree to which citations tend to occur between papers that are concerned with seemingly related topics or research problems. Drawing on a large data set of articles published in the journals of the American Physical Society between 1893 and 2009, we propose a novel method for measuring the similarity between articles through the statistical validation of the overlap between their bibliographies. Results suggest that the probability of a citation made by one article to another is indeed an increasing function of the similarity between the two articles. Our study also enables us to uncover missing citations between pairs of highly related articles, and may thus help identify barriers to effective knowledge flows. By quantifying the proportion of missing citations, we conduct a comparative assessment of distinct journals and research sub-fields in terms of their ability to facilitate or impede the dissemination of knowledge. Findings indicate that Electromagnetism and Interdisciplinary Physics are the two sub-fields in physics with the smallest percentage of missing citations. Moreover, knowledge transfer seems to be more effectively facilitated by journals of wide visibility, such as Physical Review Letters, than by lower-impact ones. Our study has important implications for authors, editors and reviewers of scientific journals, as well as public preprint repositories, as it provides a procedure for recommending relevant yet missing references and properly integrating bibliographies of papers."

    "Abs": "In this paper we consider whether people with similar personality traits have a preference for common locations. Due to the difficulty in tracking and categorising the places that individuals choose to visit, this is largely unexplored. However, the recent popularity of location-based social networks (LBSNs) provides a means to gain new insight into this question through checkins- records that are made by LBSN users of their presence at specific street level locations. A web-based participatory survey was used to collect the personality traits and checkin behaviour of 174 anonymous users, who, through their common check-ins, formed a network with 5373 edges and an approximate edge density of 35%. We assess the degree of overlap in personality traits for users visiting common locations, as detected by user checkins. We find that people with similar high levels of conscientiousness, openness or agreeableness tended to have checked-in locations in common. The findings for extraverts were unexpected in that they did not provide evidence of individuals assorting at the same locations, contrary to predictions. Individuals high in neuroticism were in line with expectations, they did not tend to have locations in common. Unanticipated results concerning disagreeableness are of particular interest and suggest that different venue types and distinctive characteristics may act as attractors for people with particularly selective tendencies. These findings have important implications for decision-making and location. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on a large sample of Chevaliers' Romance III (CR3) players, this research examines how gamers' motivational, behavioral, and relational factors are related to generalized trust in China. Adopting a coplaying-centered approach, results show that generalized trust is enabled and constrained by teammate preference, coplay patterns, and motivations. Competence preference in teammates, having more weak-tie confidants as coplayers, and competition motivation are positively, while homophily preference in teammates, having more strong-tie confidants as coplayers, and socializing motivation are negatively associated with generalized trust. This research highlights the importance of contextualizing gaming implications in specific social and institutional contexts."

    "Title": "Gender homophily in online dyadic and triadic relationships",
    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Gender homophily, or the preference for interaction with individuals of the same gender, has been observed in many contexts, especially during childhood and adolescence. In this study we investigate such phenomenon by analyzing the interactions of the similar to 10 million users of Tuenti, a Spanish social networking service popular among teenagers. In dyadic relationships we find evidence of higher gender homophily for women. We also observe a preference of users with more friends to connect to the opposite gender. A particularly marked gender difference emerges in signing up for the social networking service and adding the first friends, and in the interactions by means of wall messages. In these contexts we find evidence of a strong homophily for women, and little or no homophily for men. By examining the gender composition of triangle motifs, we observe a marked tendency of users to group into gender homogeneous clusters, with a particularly high number of male-only triangles. We show that age plays an important role in this context, with a tendency to higher homophily for young teenagers in both dyadic and triadic relationships. Our findings have implications for addressing gender gap issues, understanding adolescent online behavior and technology adoption, and modeling social networks."

In this paper, we analyze the social interactions, both online and offline, of users and investigate the development of their social ties using data trail of how social ties grow' left in mobile and social networking services. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research attempt on studying social tie development by considering both online and offline interactions in a heterogeneous yet realistic relationship. In this study, we aim to answer three key questions: (i) is there a correlation between online and offline interactions? (ii) how is the social tie developed via heterogeneous interaction channels? and (iii) would the development of social tie between two users be affected by their common friends? To achieve our goal, we develop a Social-aware Hidden Markov Model (SaHMM) that explicitly takes into account the factor of common friends in measure of the social tie development. Our experiments show that, comparing with results obtained using HMM and other heuristic methods, the social tie development captured by our SaHMM is significantly more consistent to lifetime profiles of users."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "The weight of links in a network is often related to the similarity of the nodes. Here, we introduce a simple tunable measure for analysing the similarity of nodes across different link weights. In particular, we use the measure to analyze homophily in a group of 659 freshman students at a large university. Our analysis is based on data obtained using smartphones equipped with custom data collection software, complemented by questionnaire-based data. The network of social contacts is represented as a weighted multilayer network constructed from different channels of telecommunication as well as data on face-to-face contacts. We find that even strongly connected individuals are not more similar with respect to basic personality traits than randomly chosen pairs of individuals. In contrast, several socio-demographics variables have a significant degree of similarity. We further observe that similarity might be present in one layer of the multilayer network and simultaneously be absent in the other layers. For a variable such as gender, our measure reveals a transition from similarity between nodes connected with links of relatively low weight to dis-similarity for the nodes connected by the strongest links. We finally analyze the overlap between layers in the network for different levels of acquaintanceships."

    "Abs": "Navigability, an ability to find a logarithmically short path between elements using only local information, is one of the most fascinating properties of real-life networks. However, the exact mechanism responsible for the formation of navigation properties remained unknown. We show that navigability can be achieved by using only two ingredients present in the majority of networks: network growth and local homophily, giving a persuasive answer how the navigation appears in real-life networks. A very simple algorithm produces hierarchical self-similar optimally wired navigable small world networks with exponential degree distribution by using only local information. Adding preferential attachment produces a scale-free network which has shorter greedy paths, but worse (power law) scaling of the information extraction locality (algorithmic complexity of a search). Introducing saturation of the preferential attachment leads to truncated scale-free degree distribution that offers a good trade-off between these parameters and can be useful for practical applications. Several features of the model are observed in real-life networks, in particular in the brain neural networks, supporting the earlier suggestions that they are navigable."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "In recent years, the world of social media and online networking has met with the world of international development, leading to rapid changes in development practice and to the emergence of new fields of study. Proponents of this change argue that the Internet provides the tools for global cooperation and participation. However, the reality is less clear, with critics asserting that much of the Information and Communication Technology and networking discourse and practice is rooted in past approaches to development. This reflects a wider debate about whether ICT provides space for alternative views and social movements, or if it represents a new form of networked information colonialism. Drawing on ethnographic research with the online development-oriented network projecthonduras.com, this paper reflects on these debates, and on the wider implications of social media in development practice. An early model of peer-to-peer collaboration in development, projecthonduras.com has over a decade of networking experience and has been the catalyst for many connections and encounters, which have, at times, literally saved lives. However, while research with this network highlights some potential for disintermediated and inclusive networking, it also provides an example of a conventional development approach operating within an online space, and illustrates the impact of digital exclusion and homophily. Using the networking concepts of disintermediation, participation and diversity/homophily, this paper explores the structure and discourse of projecthonduras.com and illustrates the paradoxical nature of ICT and social media in development, providing a cautionary note to those who look to social media to provide answers to contemporary development dilemmas."

    "Abs": "This study attempts to investigate the online expressive behavior of social media users in China. Specifically, we combine machine learning-based textual analysis with social network analysis to examine the structure and content of the discussion network which formed around the political aspects of food safety issues on China's Twitter-like Weibo. The findings suggest that Weibo-mediated communication space does not serve as an effective forum for deliberative discussion because people of like mind tend to cluster and the factor of emotion predominates. Further statistical analyses of a hand-coded sample show that emotional discussions influence people more than cognitive discussions, with distinct emotions (e.g., anger, fear and sadness) having different effects. A poster's status is also found to matter. We contend that this kind of online civic talk underlines an expressive form of rationality that transcends the dominant bipolar instrumental-communicative dimension for understanding the use of social media in online political discussion.

    "Title": "A network model characterized by a latent attribute structure with competition",
    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "The quest for a model that is able to explain, describe, analyze and simulate real-world complex networks is of uttermost practical, as well as theoretical, interest. In fact, networks can be a natural way to represent many phenomena; often, they arise from a complex interweaving of some features of the nodes. For example, in a co-authorship network, a link stems more easily between authors with similar interests; similarly, in a genetic regulatory network, links are affected by the different biological functions of the regulators. In this paper we introduce and study a novel network model that is based on a latent attribute structure: this model, inspired by a generalization of the Indian Buffet process, is simple and contains a small number of parameters, with a clear and intuitive role. Each node is characterized by a number of features and the probability of the existence of an edge between two nodes depends on the features they share; the number of possible features is not fixed a priori and can grow indefinitely. Moreover, a random fitness parameter is introduced for each node in order to determine its ability to transmit its own features to other nodes; this behavior is added on top of a process of Indian-Buffet type. Because of the fitness property, a node's connectivity does not depend on its age alone, so that also \"young but fit\" nodes are able to compete and succeed in propagating their features and acquiring links. We also show how, considering the resulting bipartite node-attribute network, it is possible to gain some insight about which nodes were originally the most \"fit\".Our model for this bipartite network depends on few parameters, that are characterized by their straightforward interpretation and by the availability of proper estimators. Even if the parameters are easy to interpret and tune, the model is general enough to represent complex phenomena-e.g., homophily, heterophily, or any interplay between features. We provide some theoretical as well as experimental results regarding the power-law behavior of the model and the proposed tools for the estimation of the parameters. We also show, through a number of experiments, how the proposed model naturally captures most local and global properties (e.g., degree distributions, connectivity and distance distributions) real networks exhibit.

However, I argue that the gender inequality of the sector is partly the result of the fact that small new enterprises rely on family support and close social networks. Few women are able to join the sector with male friends and colleagues due to the close social ties of the founding teams (homophily). Among my female interviewees, half have started their nascent companies with their husbands and male partners (husband and wife teams). However, gender, family backgrounds and childcare responsibilities affect both men and women, and the interviewees in my study were open in discussing these personal factors in relation to being entrepreneurs. This article argues that starting an Internet company is a family decision, discussed within the household. Intersectionality, not only gender, explains the founders' decision to start a company, and their choice of co-founders."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "This paper studies the formation of peer groups entailing the joint production of public goods. In our model agents choose their peers and have to pay a connection cost for each member added to the group. After groups are formed, each agent selects a public project to make a costly contribution to, and all members of the group experience the benefits of these contributions. Since agents differ in how much they value one project relative to the other, the group's preferences affect the generated profile of public goods. We characterize mutually optimal groups, groups that are optimal for all their members. When contribution costs are low relative to connection costs, mutually optimal groups must be sufficiently homogeneous. As contribution costs increase relative to connection costs, agents desire more connections, which in turn raises the risk of free riding. Extreme peers are then more appealing, since they are more willing to contribute, and polarization arises. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

    "Abs": "This study examines whether an institution's research resources affect its centrality and relationships in international collaboration among 606 astronomical institutions worldwide. The findings support our theoretical hypotheses that an institution's research resources are positively related to its central position in the network. Astronomical institutions with superior resources, such as being equipped with international observational facilities and having substantial research manpower, tend to have more foreign partners (high degree centrality) and play an influential role (high betweenness centrality) in the international collaboration network. An institution becomes more and more active in international collaborations as its research population expands. In terms of the relationship, which is captured by an actor institution's co-authorship preference for each partner in the network, the effect of research resources is not as significant as expected. We found that astronomical institutions are not necessarily preferentially co-authoring with partners that have better research resources. In addition, this study indicates that geographic closeness (or \"geographic proximity\") largely affects the occurrence of international collaboration. The investigated institutions apparently prefer partners from neighboring countries. This finding gives an indication of the phenomenon of regional homophily in the international collaboration network."

Through a thorough quantitative analysis we provide important insights about the anatomy of the system across which misinformation might spread. In particular, we show that users' engagement on verified (or unverified) content correlates with the number of friends having similar consumption patterns (homophily). Finally, we measure how this social system responded to the injection of 4, 709 false information. We find that the frequent (and selective) exposure to specific kind of content (polarization) is a good proxy for the detection of homophile clusters where certain kind of rumors are more likely to spread."

First, it is possible to distinguish between off-line (player) and online (avatar) characteristics. Second, these environments offer new possibilities for studying friendship formation. By tracking friendship requests and their acceptance rate, researchers are able to distinguish between with whom players want to become friends and with whom they actually do become friends. This article examined friendship formation in Timik, a graphical virtual world targeted at Polish teenagers. Homophily, preferential attachment and status were tested as possible underlying mechanisms. Results showed that preferential attachment and status drove invitations: Players wanted to become friends with high-status players. However, high-status players were also more likely to reject offers. Homophily only played a minor role. Players preferred players of the same avatar class and similar age but of the opposite sex. Too similar avatars were disliked. The results are discussed in the light of the generalizability of off-line theories of friendship formation to online worlds."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Modeling and predicting human behaviors, such as the level and intensity of physical activity, is a key to preventing the cascade of obesity and helping spread healthy behaviors in a social network. In our conference paper, we have developed a social influence model, named socialized Gaussian process (SGP), for socialized human behavior modeling. Instead of explicitly modeling social influence as individuals' behaviors influenced by their friends' previous behaviors, SGP models the dynamic social correlation as the result of social influence. The SGP model naturally incorporates personal behavior factor and social correlation factor (i.e., the homophily principle: Friends tend to perform similar behaviors) into a unified model. And it models the social influence factor (i.e., an individual's behavior can be affected by his/her friends) implicitly in dynamic social correlation schemes. The detailed experimental evaluation has shown the SGP model achieves better prediction accuracy compared with most of baseline methods. However, a Socialized Random Forest model may perform better at the beginning compared with the SGP model. One of the main reasons is the dynamic social correlation function is purely based on the users' sequential behaviors without considering other physical activity-related features. To address this issue, we further propose a novel \"multi-feature SGP model\" (mfSGP) which improves the SGP model by using multiple physical activity-related features in the dynamic social correlation learning. Extensive experimental results illustrate that the mfSGP model clearly outperforms all other models in terms of prediction accuracy and running time."

We used a database that aggregates actual mobile communication patterns of business users of a large Israeli cell phone company (n=16,199). Our findings, among a large sample of businesses, provide support for the place and mobile communication perspective. The results reveal a negative association between spatial distance and mobile business communication networks. As spatial distance between business network members increases, business social ties through mobile communication decreases. Furthermore, the results also revealed a negative association between spatial distance and mobile network density. As the spatial distance between business users increases, the density of the mobile communication network diminishes. Physical proximity promotes the development of dense business networks. The implications of the findings are discussed."

Results show that luxury brand perceptions and purchase intentions for the experimental groups, who watched vlogs reviewing luxury products, were higher than control group, who did not watch vlog.

With the advances of Internet related technologies, online surveys are established as an essential tool for a wide range of applications. One significant issue of online survey is how to select a quality respondent group so that the survey result is reliable. This paper studies the use of pairwise online social relationships among the members of a society to form a biased survey respondent group, which might be useful for various applications. We first introduce a way to construct a homophily-high social relation graph. Then, we introduce the minimum inverse k-core dominating set problem (MIkCDSP), which aims to compute a biased respondent group using the homophily-high social relation graph. We show the problem is NP-hard and most importantly propose a greedy approximation for it. Our simulation based on a real social network shows the proposed algorithm is very effective."

A group of connected people with similar personality traits is termed as a homophily. In this paper, we develop a method to identify homophilies by analyzing the Big5 personality traits of users from their interactions in an egocentric network like Facebook. We observe that our homophilies correctly cluster ranged from 73 to 87 % users for different personality traits. We also present a novel validation technique to verify those extracted homophilies in real life. Note that we are the first to validate the extracted homophilies and compare those with baseline techniques from SNS usage in real life using an interview-based method.

This approach has a wide range of potential applications, e.g., collecting diversified complaints from the customers while most of them are satisfied, but is hardly investigated. We formulate the problem of computing such a group as the p-biased-representative selection problem (p-BRSP), where p represents the size of the group constraint by the available budget. This problem has two independent optimization goals and therefore is difficult to deal with. We introduce two polynomial time algorithms for the problem, where each of which has an approximation ratio with respect to each of the objectives when the other optimization objective is substituted with a constraint. Under the substituted constraint, we prove that the first algorithm is an O(ln Delta)-approximation (which is best possible) algorithm with respect to the first objective and the second algorithm is a 2-approximation ( which is best possible) with respect to the second objective, where Delta is the degree of the input social relation graph."

SNCStream(+) tackles the data stream clustering problem as a network formation and evolution problem, where instances and micro clusters form clusters based on homophily. Our proposal has its parameters analyzed and it is evaluated in a broad set of problems against literature baselines.

    "Abs": "A growing number of online social networks are designed with the intention to promote health by providing virtual space wherein individuals can seek and share information and support with similar others. Research has shown that real-world social networks have a significant influence on one's health behavior and outcomes. However, there is a dearth of studies on how individuals form social networks in virtual space and whether such online social networks exert any impact on individuals' health outcomes. Built on the Multi-Theoretical Multilevel (MTML) framework and drawing from literature on social influence, this study examined the mechanisms underlying the formation of an online health social network and empirically tested social influence on individual health outcomes through the network. Situated in a weight management social networking site, the study tracked a health buddy network of 709 users and their weight management activities and outcomes for 4months. Actor-based modeling was used to test the joint dynamics of preferential selection and social influence among health buddies. The results showed that baseline, inbreeding, and health status homophily significantly predicted preferential selection of health buddies in the weight management social networking site, whereas self-interest in seeking experiential health information did not. The study also found peer influence of online health buddy networks on individual weight outcomes, such that an individual's odds of losing weight increased if, on average, the individual's health buddies were losing weight."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "This research demonstrates the utility of the theory of weak ties for understanding the patterns of resource usage and sharing in an online professional learning community. Our context of study is a community of educators using and sharing teaching resources such as lesson plans, presentation slides and animations. We consider whether the deduced relationships between members of the community of educators constitute weak ties. A deduced relationship exists when two educators access the same resource. If these deduced relationships do constitute weak ties, then other theorized network properties should also be manifest, namely homophily and triadic closures. Our findings support these theoretical conjectures. Firstly, results indicate that the strength of a tie is directly proportional to the level of similarity between users in the network in terms of their propensity to use and share resources and their level of comfort with and use of technology (homophily property). Secondly, we found strong support for the triadic closure property (formation of a weak tie between unconnected nodes that share a common neighbor). Thus, we developed a computational model to predict the formation of weak ties via triadic closures with an accuracy of 97.8 %. Finally, we show that augmenting collaborative and hybrid recommender systems with our triadic closure prediction model can improve the performance of these systems."

    "Abs": "Social media has brought a revolution on how people are consuming news. Beyond the undoubtedly large number of advantages brought by social-media platforms, a point of criticism has been the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles, caused by social homophily and algorithmic personalization.In this paper we address the problem of balancing the information exposure in a social network. We assume that two opposing campaigns (or viewpoints) are present in the network, and that network nodes have different preferences towards these campaigns. Our goal is to find two sets of nodes to employ in the respective campaigns, so that the overall information exposure for the two campaigns is balanced. We formally define the problem, characterize its hardness, develop approximation algorithms, and present experimental evaluation results.Our model is inspired by the literature on influence maximization, but there are significant differences from the standard model. First, balance of information exposure is modeled by a symmetric difference function, which is neither monotone nor submodular, and thus, not amenable to existing approaches. Second, while previous papers consider a setting with selfish agents and provide bounds on best-response strategies (i.e., move of the last player), we consider a setting with a centralized agent and provide bounds for a global objective function."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Using social media for the purpose of disseminating mental health information is a critical area of scientific inquiry for health communication professionals. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the presence of a first-person testimonial in educational mental health information placed in Facebook and Twitter messages influenced college students' (N=257) source perceptions, information processing, cognitive elaboration, health information recall, beliefs, and behavioral intentions. Results show that exposure to social media messages that featured mental health information embedded with a testimonial predicted less source homophily and more critical thoughts about the social media source, less systematic message processing, and less cognitive elaboration. Health information recall was significantly impacted by both the social media platform and message content such that participants in the testimonial condition on Facebook were more likely to recall the health facts in those messages whereas participants who viewed the testimonial in Twitter were less likely to recall the facts in those tweets. Compared to those who read Facebook messages, participants who read Twitter messages reported higher levels of systematic message processing. These findings suggest that the integration of health testimonials into social media messages might inadvertently provoke psychological resistance to mental health information, thereby reducing the persuasive impact of those messages."

Adopting the theoretical lens of public deliberation, this paper investigates the evolution of patterns of similar-minded and different-minded interactions over time on a Chinese online discussion forum. We analyse the content and reply networks of 18,000+ messages on four highly debated topics on the Bulletin Board System (BBS) platform Tianya. Findings provide nuanced evidence to the phenomenon of increased network homophily over time, mitigated in discussions where the difference between opinion sides is smaller, and participants have positive opinions. Providing empirical foundation for testing and refining the tenets of public deliberation in the unique sociocultural and institutional environment of China, this study lays ground for future investigation on independent variables for understanding dynamics of online discussions, and for studies comparing cases across different contexts."

    "Abs": "This study investigates how the attributes of online social platforms (e.g., open vs. closed, symmetric vs. asymmetric social networks) and user preferences regarding platform diversity (e.g., single-homing vs. multi-homing) moderate the influence of homophily on user behaviors across varied social segments. On the basis of panel data, we delve into the interplay among homophily, structural diversities across various online social networking services (SNSs), and users' homing preferences in such social platforms. The data feature of the SNS consumption behaviors of 10,172 individual users are obtained over a period of 134 days. An agent-based simulation model is developed to further validate and generalize the empirical findings. The simulation and empirical results consistently indicate that propensity toward homophily differs significantly across platform types and users' channel adoption behaviors. Online homophily is more pronounced in closed, private social networks than in open, public social networks. Users of asymmetric and symmetric SNSs exhibit weak and strong homophily, respectively. Moreover, whereas users who adopt a single SNS channel tend toward homophily, those who subscribe to multiple SNSs confirm the idea that \"opposites attract.\" These findings suggest that users of online SNS channels manifest complex human interactions typified by the combination of homophily, heterophily, and asymmetric social preference, although homophily is the most prominent disposition. Our findings suggest that homophily should be considered a dynamically changing human characteristic rather than a static attribute, and stakeholders should exploit the complex nature of users' homophilous behaviors to address social problems in online SNSs and to enhance the effectiveness of social advertising."

    "Abs": "With many users adopting location-based social networks (LBSNs) to share their daily activities, LBSNs become a gold mine for researchers to study human check-in behavior. Modeling such behavior can benefit many useful applications such as urban planning and location-aware recommender systems. Unlike previous studies [4,6,12,17] that focus on the effect of distance on users checking in venues, we consider two venue-specific effects of geographical neighborhood influence, namely, spatial homophily and neighborhood competition. The former refers to the fact that venues share more common features with their spatial neighbors, while the latter captures the rivalry of a venue and its nearby neighbors in order to gain visitation from users. In this paper, through an extensive empirical study, we show that these two geographical effects, together with social homophily, play significant roles in understanding users' check-in behaviors. From the observation, we then propose to model users' check-in behavior by incorporating these effects into a matrix factorization-based framework. To evaluate our proposed models, we conduct check-in prediction task and show that our models outperform the baselines. Furthermore, we discover that neighborhood competition effect has more impact to the users' check-in behavior than spatial homophily. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that quantitatively examine the two effects of geographical neighborhood influence on users' check-in behavior."

    "Abs": "We introduce Poisson Matrix Factorization with Content and Social trust information (PoissonMF-CS), a latent variable probabilistic model for recommender systems with the objective of jointly modeling social trust, item content and user's preference using Poisson matrix factorization framework. This probabilistic model is equivalent to collectively factorizing a non-negative user-item interaction matrix and a non-negative item-content matrix. The user-item matrix consists of sparse implicit (or explicit) interactions counts between user and item, and the item-content matrix consists of words or tags counts per item. The model imposes additional constraints given by the social ties between users, and the homophily effect on social networks-the tendency of people with similar preferences to be socially connected. Using this model we can account for and fine-tune the weight of content-based and social-based factors in the user preference. We develop approximate variational inference algorithm and perform experiments comparing PoissonMFCS with competing models. The experimental evaluation indicates that PoissonMF-CS achieves superior predictive performance on held-out data for the top-M recommendations task. Also, we observe that PoissonMFCS generates compact latent representations when compared with alternative models while maintaining superior predictive performance."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "S ocial media platforms such as weblogs and social networking sites provide Internet users with an unprecedented means to express their opinions and debate on a wide range of issues. Concurrently with their growing importance in public communication, social media platforms may foster echo chambers and filter bubbles: homophily and content personalization lead users to be increasingly exposed to conforming opinions. There is therefore a need for unbiased systems able to identify and provide access to varied viewpoints. To address this task, we propose in this paper a novel unsupervised topic model, the Social Network Viewpoint Discovery Model (SNVDM). Given a specific issue (e.g., U.S. policy) as well as the text and social interactions from the users discussing this issue on a social networking site, SNVDM jointly identifies the issue's topics, the users' viewpoints, and the discourse pertaining to the different topics and viewpoints. In order to overcome the potential sparsity of the social network (i.e., some users interact with only a few other users), we propose an extension to SNVDM based on the Generalized Polya Urn sampling scheme (SNVDM-GPU) to leverage \"acquaintances of acquaintances\" relationships. We benchmark the different proposed models against three baselines, namely TAM, SN-LDA, and VODUM, on a viewpoint clustering task using two real-world datasets. We thereby provide evidence that our model SNVDM and its extension SNVDM-GPU significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines, and we show that utilizing social interactions greatly improves viewpoint clustering performance."

    "Abs": "The soaring of social media services has greatly propelled the prevalence of document networks. Rather than a set of plain texts, documents are nodes in graphs. An observable link connects the documents at its two ends, thus it implicitly reflects the semantic association between the document pair. Previous work assumes that only similar documents tend to be connected, which neglects the rich connective patterns in the topological structure. In this paper, we introduce a latent correlation factor to categorize the links into several categories, and each category corresponds to a unique kind of association. By fitting the data, the relational information (e.g., homophily and heterophily) can be comprehensively captured. By resorting to Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), we maximize the correlation between all pairs of linked documents. We propose a pure generative model and derive efficient learning algorithms based on the variational EM methods. Experiments on three different datasets demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive and usually better than the state-of-the-art baselines on both topic modeling and link prediction."

Existing name-based nationality classifiers use name sub strings as features and are trained on small, unrepresentative sets of labeled names, typically extracted from Wikipedia. As a result, these methods achieve limited performance and cannot support fine-grained classification.We exploit the phenomena of homophily in communication patterns to learn name embeddings, a new representation that encodes gender, ethnicity, and nationality which is readily applicable to building classifiers and other systems. Through our analysis of 57M contact lists from a major Internet company, we are able to design a fine-grained nationality classifier covering 39 groups representing over 90% of the world population. In an evaluation against other published systems over 13 common classes, our Fl score (0.795) is substantial better than our closest competitor Ethnea (0.580). To the best of our knowledge, this is the most accurate, fine-grained nationality classifier available.As a social media application, we apply our classifiers to the followers of major Twitter celebrities over six different domains. We demonstrate stark differences in the ethnicities of the followers of Trump and Obama, and in the sports and entertainments favored by different groups. Finally, we identify an anomalous political figure whose presumably inflated following appears largely incapable of reading the language he posts in."

This correlation was observed both at the state level and at the county level, and remained stable throughout the main election season. We propose a simple model based on homophily in social networks to explain the linear association. Finally, we highlight examples of different types of fake news stories: while certain stories continue to circulate in the population, others are short-lived and die out in a few days."

The proposed algorithm depends on the network structure alone and explores the dissimilarity and similarity between each pair of nodes to identify the communities. The dissimilarity measure will separate nodes into different groups, while the similarity measure will merge nodes into clusters. The empirical experiments on real-world networks against state-of-the-art algorithms are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

It allows to understand the structure of complex networks and to extract useful information from the detected communities. Users have usually a social interaction with their friends because of their common interests or their similar profiles. In this paper, attributed graphs are considered, where entities of the network are described using attributes with several modalities. Then, we propose an hybrid approach based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) for community detection in social network with node attributes. This method, called ACDC (Attributed Community Detection based on Concepts), combines the structure of the network and the attributes of the nodes. ACDC, semantically and statically, partitions an assigned graph into k densely connected communities, using maximal cliques, with homogeneous attribute values derived from FCA. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACDC through comparison with the state-of-the-art graph clustering and methods. Our method provides also more meaningful communities than conventional methods that consider only relationship information."

    "Abs": "Public sentiments affecting health outcomes are increasingly modulated by social media. Existing literature mainly focus on investigating how network structure affects the contagion of health sentiments. However, most of these studies neglect that the interaction topology change in time. In fact, the change of inter-individual connections over time is associated with individual attributes. The mechanism through which individual attributes reshapes the connection topology is mainly governed by the competition between two principles, i.e., homophily (establishing or reinforcing social connections) and homeostasis (preserving the total strength of social connections to each individual). No existing approaches are yet able to accommodate these two competing effects at the same time.We thus propose a new statistical model (H2 model, Homophily and Homestasis model) to depict the evolution of temporal network, which is governed by the competition of homophily and homeostasis. In addition, we consider the mediation effect of external shock events, which enables us to separate exogenous confounding factors. Evaluation on Twitter data suggests that H2 model can capture long-range sentiment dynamics and external shock events. In sentiment prediction, H2 consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of error rate. Through the model's shock tensor, we successfully detect several typical events, and reveal that users in negative emotions are more influenced by external shock events than those with positive emotions. Our findings have practical significance for those who supervise and guide health sentiments in online communities."

This can be explained by influences and homophilies. Independently of its origin, this assortativity gives us information about each node given its neighbors. Assortativity can thus be used to improve individual predictions in a broad range of situations, when data are missing or inaccurate. This paper presents a general framework based on probabilistic graphical models to exploit social network structures for improving individual predictions of node attributes. Using this framework, we quantify the assortativity range leading to an accuracy gain in several situations. We finally show how specific characteristics of the network can improve performances further. For instance, the gender assortativity in real-world mobile phone data changes significantly according to some communication attributes. In this case, individual predictions with 75% accuracy are improved by up to 3%."

Tradition sample approaches are either resources-intensive or data-biased. In this paper, we proposed a target distribution guided sample process to solve the problem of imbalanced user data in the virtual space. We make intervention to the sampling procedure according to the real-time divergence of the collected sample set against the target distribution, apply theory of homophily to discover the users with matched features and refine the samples with recursive sampling. Experiments show this method is able to successfully constrain samples' overall structure according to the given distribution within a given JS divergence of 0.1 while leaving the unrelated features distributed randomly. Moreover, it takes less times of access to collect a certain number of samples for the method proposed in this paper and thus save time and computer resources."

Demographic and sociological researches have provided various ways of collecting people's trajectory data through oline means. However, collecting oline data consumes a lot of resources, and the data availability is usually limited. Fortunately, the wide spread of online social network (OSN) applications over mobile devices relect many geographical information, where we could devise a light weight approach of conducting the study on the projection of the population distribution using the online data. In this paper, we propose a geo-homophily model in OSNs to help project the population distribution in a given division of geographical regions. We establish a three-layer theoretic framework: It first describes the relationship between the online message difusion among friends in the OSN and the oline population distribution over a given division of regions via a Dirichlet process, and then projects the loating population across the regions. Evaluations over large-scale OSN datasets show that the proposed prediction models can characterize the process of the formation of the population distribution and the changes of the loating population over time with a high prediction accuracy."

Therefore, Sybil detection is a fundamental security research problem in online social networks. Random walk based methods, which leverage the structure of an online social network to distribute reputation scores for users, have been demonstrated to be promising in certain real-world online social networks. In particular, random walk based methods have three desired features: they can have theoretically guaranteed performance for online social networks that have the fast-mixing property, they are accurate when the social network has strong homophily property, and they can be scalable to large-scale online social networks. However, existing random walk based methods suffer from several key limitations: 1) they can only leverage either labeled benign users or labeled Sybils, but not both, 2) they have limited detection accuracy for weak-homophily social networks, and 3) they are not robust to label noise in the training dataset.In this work, we propose a new random walk based Sybil detection method called SybilWalk. SybilWalk addresses the limitations of existing random walk based methods while maintaining their desired features. We perform both theoretical and empirical evaluations to compare SybilWalk with previous random walk based methods. Theoretically, for online social networks with the fast-mixing property, SybilWalk has a tighter asymptotical bound on the number of Sybils that are falsely accepted into the social network than all existing random walk based methods. Empirically, we compare SybilWalk with previous random walk based methods using both social networks with synthesized Sybils and a large-scale Twitter dataset with real Sybils. Our empirical results demonstrate that 1) SybilWalk is substantially more accurate than existing random walk based methods for weak-homophily social networks, 2) SybilWalk is substantially more robust to label noise than existing random walk based methods, and 3) SybilWalk is as scalable as the most efficient existing random walk based methods. In particular, on the Twitter dataset, SybilWalk achieves a false positive rate of 1.3% and a false negative rate of 17.3%."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Link prediction is an important and interesting application for social networks because it can infer potential links among network participants. Existing approaches basically work with the homophily principle, i.e., people of similar characteristics tend to befriend each other. In this way, however, they are not suitable for inferring negative links or hostile links, which usually take place among people with different characteristics. Moreover, negative links tend to couple with positive links to form signed networks. In this paper, we thus study the problem of disentangled link prediction (DLP) for signed networks, which includes two separate tasks, i.e., inferring positive links and inferring negative links. Recently, representation learning methods have been proposed to solve the link prediction problem because the entire network structure can be encoded in representations. For the DLP problem, we thus propose to disentangle a node representation into two representations, and use one for positive link prediction and another for negative link prediction. Experiments on three real-world signed networks demonstrate the proposed disentangled representation learning (DRL) method significantly outperforms alternatives in the DLP problem."

According to the homophily hypothesis, two vertices are more likely to be connected if they share common characteristics whereas preferential attachment states that a vertex prefers to join the more connected nodes existing in the network. To study these properties, we first introduce formal definitions of these phenomena; we then study how stochastic mixed membership models relate to these definitions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that standard stochastic mixed membership models comply with homophily with the similarity that underlies them. For preferential attachment, the situation is more contrasted: if these models do not comply with global preferential attachment, their compliance to local preferential attachment depends on whether the memberships to latent factors are hard or soft, and in the latter case on whether the underlying latent factor distribution is bursty or not. We illustrate these elements on synthetic and real networks by using the generative properties of Bayesian model."

The performance of the algorithm is measured with real network data and content observed on a social media site. Precision-Recall performance improvements of 30% are demonstrated with this dataset, compared to a baseline approach that does not exploit homophily. Because real-world graphs grow exponentially, this performance improvement may have a significant impact on graph analytic algorithms with sensitivities to the graph sampling quality."

A separable temporal exponential random graph model (STERGM) shows that the number of partners is important for formation but not dissolution, while industrial homophily helps both to make and maintain connections. In addition, statistical trends suggest that while networks change, a few players have acted continuously as coordination hubs for the bulk of the decades. However, a number of other key players in particular decades would be missed without a dynamic perspective."

However, a person sharing information in a social network differs from a computer transmitting a virus in two important respects: a person may not have the opportunity to pass the information to every tie, and may be unwilling to pass the information to certain ties even when presented with the opportunity. Accounting for these two features reveals that, while additional random ties allow information to jump to distant regions of a network, they also change the composition of network neighborhoods. When the latter increases the proportion of neighbors to whom people are less willing to pass information, the result can be a net decrease in diffusion. I show that this is the case in heterogeneous, homophilous networks: the addition of random ties strictly impedes information dissemination, and the impediment is increasing in both original homophily and the number of new ties."

The community data is unique as it describes how the network has evolved since its inception and because the information exchanged through the network was predominantly about the achievements of participants in the program and therefore influencing behavior through social comparison. The analyses show that the largest component of the community network has characteristics of a small world network. The analyses also show that connections are formed according to a strong attachment preference according to the gender, and a weaker homophily for Body Mass Index. The presented analysis can serve as basis for creating novel interventions that influence physical activity behavior through social connections."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Homophily is considered by network scientists as one of the major mechanisms of social network formation. However, the role of dynamic homophily in the network growth process has not been investigated in detail yet. In this paper, we estimate the role of homophily by various attributes at different stages of online network formation process. We consider the process of online friendship formation in the Vkontakte social networking site among first-year students at a Russian university. We reveal that at the beginning of the network formation a similarity in gender and score in entrance exams plays the key role, while by the end of network establishment period the role of the same group affiliation becomes more important. We explain the results with the tendency of students to follow different strategies to control the information flow in their social environment."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Classification in sparsely labeled networks is challenging to traditional neighborhood-based methods due to the lack of labeled neighbors. In this paper, we propose a novel behavior-based collective classification (BCC) method to improve the classification performance in sparsely labeled networks. In BCC, nodes' behavior features are extracted and used to build latent relationships between labeled nodes and unknown ones. Since mining the latent links does not rely on the direct connection of nodes, decrease of labeled neighbors will have minor effect on classification results. In addition, the BCC method can also be applied to the analysis of networks with heterophily as the homophily assumption is no longer required. Experiments on various public data sets reveal that the proposed method can obtain competing performance in comparison with the other state-of-the-art methods either when the network is labeled sparsely or when homophily is low in the network."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "During the last five years, the amount of users of online social networks has increased exponentially. With the growing of users, social problems also arise. Due to the nature of these platforms, specifically Twitter, users can express their ideas in the way they prefer no matter if it is racist or not. As the Twitter CEO says, one of the most difficult things for them is to detect and ban people who harass others. Researches have addressed this issue in recent years. However, it is needed a wider range of strategies to detect racist users and content. In this work, we collect tweets produced by the ego networks of the two former 2016 US Presidential Candidates: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, grouped in four datasets. After deleting spammers, we get 84,371 unique users labeled by using two different metrics: Sentiment Word Count and Racist Score. Both of them let us not only to identify users as racists, but also to detect the level of negativism by analyzing their most recent 200 tweets, increasing the effectiveness of the method. Using it, we find the most negative and racist user and the most positive and non-racist user from all datasets. Taking advantage of the topological properties of the ego networks we analyzed, we also verify that our results satisfy the sociologist theory of homophily; where the followers of each candidate represent their homophilous. For a nation as the United States of America, detecting online harassers might help to decrease racism and cyberbullying, social problems that affect their society. A world without online harassers is an utopia, but this is one step to achieve it."

Building on media ecology research, we introduce the notion of integrated media effects. We draw on resource dependence and homophily theories to analyze the mechanisms that connect media systems. To test the integrated media effects, we examine the relationships between news media visibility and social media visibility and hyperlinking patterns among 410 nongovernmental organization (NGO) websites in China. NGOs with greater news media visibility and more social media followers receive significantly more hyperlinks. Further, NGOs with a similar number of social media followers prefer to hyperlink to each other. The results suggest that both news media and social media systems are related to the configuration of hyperlink networks, providing support for the integrated media effects described. Implications for the study of hyperlink networks, online behaviors of organizations, and public relations are drawn from the results."

    "Abs": "Purpose - Brand \"Likes\" on Facebook facilitate self-expression, forming part of consumers' virtual selves. Yet, consumers' brand \"Likes\" may bear little resemblance to their material realities. This paper aims to test similarities of brand image with self-image for Facebook \"Likes\" to determine whether self-congruence with a \"Liked\" brand leads to positive offline brand outcomes. It also investigates whether consumers' perceptions about their Facebook social relations influence self-congruent brand \"Likes\".Design/methodology/approach - A large-scale survey was conducted of regular Facebook users who \"Liked\" brands. Data from 438 respondents was analysed and hypotheses tested using structural equation modeling.Findings - Empirical results show that the perceived self-congruence with a \"Liked\" brand increases with social tie strength. Perceived social tie strength is informed by perceived attitude homophily. When the perceived self-congruence with a \"Liked\" brand is higher, brand love and word of mouth (WOM) are enhanced. Consumers also have greater brand loyalty and offer more WOM when brands are loved.Research limitations/implications - Findings demonstrate the influence of consumers' cognitive network on \"Likes\" and brand outcomes. Further replication would enhance generalisability. Future research should use a wider sample and investigate other variables. Practical implications - Findings support managers seeking to grow and analyse Facebook \"Likes\" by providing insights into brand loyalty, brand love and WOM for \"Liked\" brands.Originality/value - The paper addresses the dearth of research exploring how consumers' perceptions of their Facebook network influence their online brand behaviour and how perceived self-congruence with a \"Liked\" brand relates to brand outcomes."

The study uses a Facebook API to help participants pick five Facebook friends to act as their favorite sources for advice on shopping.Findings-The results suggest that consumers' deal evaluations (as shaped by the recency effects of previous exposure to prices and the influence of Facebook friends and C2C websites) have carry-over effects on their eWOM intentions. The influence of Facebook friends and C2C websites on deal evaluation is as powerful as that of reference price, especially concerning the mean and the lowest prices.Practical implications-The findings encourage marketers to invest their resources in targeting online groups, and suggest that C2C website marketers should set their offer prices between the mean and the lowest prices.Originality/value-This study extends prior research on the motives for eWOM dissemination and elaborates an approach to initiate eWOM intention through deal evaluation."

    "Abs": "This paper establishes the power of dynamic collaborative task completion among workers for urban mobile crowd-sourcing. Collaboration is defined via the notion of peer referrals, whereby a worker who has accepted a location-specific task, but is unlikely to visit that location, offloads the task to a willing friend. Such a collaborative framework might be particularly useful for task bundles, especially for bundles that have higher geographic dispersion. The challenge, however, comes from the high similarity observed in the spatio-temporal pattern of task completion among friends. Using extensive real-world crowd-sourcing studies conducted over 7 weeks and 1000+ workers on a campus-based crowd-sourcing platform, we quantify the effect of such \"task completion homophily\", and show that incorporating such peer-preferences can improve worker-specific models of task preferences by over 30%. We then show that such collaborative offloading works in spite of such spatio-temporal similarity, primarily because workers refer tasks to their close friends, who in turn perform such peer-requested tasks (with over 95% completion rate) even if they experience detours that are significantly larger (often more than twice) than what they normally tolerate for platform-recommended tasks."

    "Abs": "Almost all real-world social networks are dynamic and evolving with time, where new links may form and old links may drop, largely determined by the homophily of social actors (i.e., nodes in the network). Meanwhile, (latent) properties of social actors, such as their opinions, are changing along the time, partially due to social influence received from the network, which will in turn affect the network structure. Social network evolution and node property migration are usually treated as two orthogonal problems, and have been studied separately. In this paper, we propose a co-evolution model that closes the loop by modeling the two phenomena together, which contains two major components: (1) a network generative model when the node property is known; and (2) a property migration model when the social network structure is known. Simulation shows that our model has several nice properties: (1) it can model a broad range of phenomena such as opinion convergence (i.e., herding) and community-based opinion divergence; and (2) it allows to control the evolution via a set of factors such as social influence scope, opinion leader, and noise level. Finally, the usefulness of our model is demonstrated by an application of co-sponsorship prediction for legislative bills in Congress, which outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines."

Feature selection is powerful to prepare high-dimensional data by finding a subset of relevant features. A vast majority of existing feature selection algorithms for social media data exclusively focus on positive interactions among linked instances such as friendships and user following relations. However, in many real-world social networks, instances may also be negatively interconnected. Recent work shows that negative links have an added value over positive links in advancing many learning tasks. In this paper, we study a novel problem of unsupervised feature selection in signed social networks and propose a novel framework SignedFS. In particular, we provide a principled way to model positive and negative links for user latent representation learning. Then we embed the user latent representations into feature selection when label information is not available. Also, we revisit the principle of homophily and balance theory in signed social networks and incorporate the signed graph regularization into the feature selection framework to capture the first-order and the second-order proximity among users in signed social networks. Experiments on two real-world signed social networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Further experiments are conducted to understand the impacts of different components of SignedFS."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "A widely recognized organizing principle of networks is structural homophily, which suggests that people with more common neighbors are more likely to connect with each other. However, what influence the diverse structures embedded in common neighbors (e.g., (sic) and (sic)) have on link formation is much less well-understood. To explore this problem, we begin by characterizing the structural diversity of common neighborhoods. Using a collection of 120 large-scale networks, we demonstrate that the impact of the common neighborhood diversity on link existence can vary substantially across networks. We find that its positive effect on Facebook and negative effect on Linkedln suggest different underlying networking needs in these networks. We also discover striking cases where diversity violates the principle of homophily that is, where fewer mutual connections may lead to a higher tendency to link with each other. We then leverage structural diversity to develop a common neighborhood signature (CNS), which we apply to a large set of networks to uncover unique network superfamilies not discoverable by conventional methods. Our findings shed light on the pursuit to understand the ways in which network structures are organized and formed, pointing to potential advancement in designing graph generation models and recommender systems."

In this work, we use a 10% sample of Twitter data spanning two consecutive years and encompassing 365.98 million users to perform a longitudinal, measurement -driven analysis of five prevalent device types - Android, iPhone-iOS, BlackBerry, other mobile devices, and nonmobile devices - across the time period. We study the global and regional usage patterns, as well as the regional distribution, of devices; investigate differences and similarities in behavioral patterns across devices with respect to tweet sentiment, daytime usage patterns, and feature usage (such as mentions, URLs, hashtags) over time; and quantify the level of \"device homophily\" (i.e., assortativity) within the Twitter device network. Our results reveal that key variations exist among these device groups, in addition to notable similarities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale longitudinal analysis of various distinct Twitter devices."

In this paper, we explore the sensitivity of different sampling techniques (node sampling, edge sampling, random walk sampling, and snowball sampling) on social networks with attributes. We consider the special case of networks (i) where we have one attribute with two values (e.g., male and female in the case of gender), (ii) where the size of the two groups is unequal (e.g., a male majority and a female minority), and (iii) where nodes with the same or different attribute value attract or repel each other (i.e., homophilic or heterophilic behavior). We evaluate the different sampling techniques with respect to conserving the position of nodes and the visibility of groups in such networks. Experiments are conducted both on synthetic and empirical social networks. Our results provide evidence that different network sampling techniques are highly sensitive with regard to capturing the expected centrality of nodes, and that their accuracy depends on relative group size differences and on the level of homophily that can be observed in the network. We conclude that uninformed sampling from social networks with attributes thus can significantly impair the ability of researchers to draw valid conclusions about the centrality of nodes and the visibility or invisibility of groups in social networks."

Our starting observation is a power-law degree distribution with a decreasing exponent and increasing average degree as a function of the network size. Our experiments are based on three Twitter at mention networks and three more from the Koblenz Network Collection. We observe that popular network models cannot explain decreasing power-law degree distribution exponent and increasing average degree at the same time.We propose a model that is the combination of exponential growth, and a power-law developing network, in which new \"homophily\" edges are continuously added to nodes proportional to their current homophily degree. Parameters of the average degree growth and the power-law degree distribution exponent functions depend on the ratio of the network growth exponent parameters. Specifically, we connect the growth of the average degree to the decreasing exponent of the power-law degree distribution. Prior to our work, only one of the two cases were handled. Existing models and even their combinations can only reproduce some of our key new observations in growing information networks."

Recent studies reveal that user-generated content on social media provides useful information in understanding these disorders. Most previous studies focus on studying communities of people who discuss eating disorders on social media, while few studies have explored community structures and interactions among individuals who suffer from this disease over social media. In this paper, we first develop a snowball sampling method to automatically gather individuals who self-identify as eating disordered in their profile descriptions, as well as their social network connections with one another on Twitter. Then, we verify the effectiveness of our sampling method by: 1. quantifying differences between the sampled eating disordered users and two sets of reference data collected for non-disordered users in social status, behavioral patterns and psychometric properties; 2. building predictive models to classify eating disordered and non-disordered users. Finally, leveraging the data of social connections between eating disordered individuals on Twitter, we present the first homophily study among eating-disorder communities on social media. Our findings shed new light on how an eating-disorder community develops on social media."

Most previous work assumes that documents closely linked with each other share common topics. However, the associations among documents are usually complex, which are not limited to the homophily (i.e., tendency to link to similar others). Actually, the heterophily (i.e., tendency to link to different others) is another pervasive phenomenon in social networks. In this paper, we introduce, a new tool, called copula, to separately model the documents and links, so that different copula functions can be applied to capture different correlation patterns. In statistics, a copula is a powerful framework for explicitly modeling the dependence of random variables by separating the marginals and their correlations. Though widely used in Economics, copulas have not been paid enough attention to by researchers in machine learning field. Besides, to further capture the potential associations amoug the unconnected documents, we apply the tree-averaged copula instead of a single copula function. This improvement makes our model achieve better expressive power, and also more elegant in algebra. We derive efficient EM algorithms to estimate the model parameters, and evaluate the performance of our model on three different datasets. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant improvements on both topic and link modeling compared with the current state of the art."

Such networks have been widely studied by the artificial intelligence community, and recently a connection has been made to nonlocal correlations produced by entangled particles in quantum physics-the impact of latent hidden variables can be analyzed by the same algebraic geometric methodology that relies on a sequence of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. Following this trail, we treat our sample coauthor network as a causal graph and, using SDP relaxations, rule out latent homophily as a manifestation of prior shared interest only, leading to the observed patternedness. By introducing algebraic geometry to citation studies, we add a new tool to existing methods for the analysis of content-related social influences."

    "Abs": "Open Source Software projects are communities in which people \"learn the ropes\" from each other. The social and technical activities of developers evolve together, and as they link to each other they get organized in a network of changing socio-technical connections. Traces of those activities, or behaviors, are typically visible to all, in project repositories and through communication between them. Thus, in principle it may be possible to study those traces to tell which of the observable socio-technical behaviors of developers in these projects are responsible for the forming of persistent links between them. It may also be possible to tell the extent to which links participate in the spread of potential behavioral influences. Since OSS projects change in both social and technical activity over time, static approaches, that either ignore time or simplify it to a few slices, are frequently inadequate to study these networks. On the other hand, ad-hoc dynamic approaches are often only loosely supported by theory and can yield misleading findings. Here we adapt the stochastic actor-oriented models from social network analysis. These models enable the study of the interplay between behavior, influence and network architecture, for dynamic networks, in a statistically sound way. We apply the stochastic actor-oriented models in case studies of two Apache Software Foundation projects, and study code ownership and developer productivity as behaviors. For those, we find evidence of significant social selection effects (homophily) in both projects, but in different directions. However, we find no evidence for the spread (social influence) of either code ownership or developer productivity behaviors through the networks."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "This paper considers the evolution of a network in a discrete time, stochastic setting in which agents learn about each other through repeated interactions and maintain/break links on the basis of what they learn. Agents exhibit homophily, the preference to link with others who are similar to themselves, and they have a limited capacity for links. They thus maintain links with others learned to be similar to themselves and cut links to those learned to be dissimilar to themselves. We introduce a new equilibrium concept we term \"matching pairwise stable equilibrium\", and we prove that such equilibrium is unique in our model. We show that higher levels of homophily decrease the (average) number of links that agents form. However, the effect of homophily is anomalous: mutually beneficial links may be dropped before learning is completed, thereby resulting in sparser networks and less clustering than under complete information. Homophily also exhibits an interesting interaction with the presence of incomplete information: initially, greater levels of homophily increase the difference between the complete and incomplete information networks, but sufficiently high levels of homophily eventually decrease the difference. Complete and incomplete information networks differ most when the degree of homophily is intermediate."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Within-network classifiers have been widely used to predict unknown data in networks. In order to evaluate the performance of existing classifiers, it is essential to generate synthetic networks with various properties. However, conventional network generation methods become ineffective under this scenario, since they are unable to produce node labels, exert topological constraints, or provide stable generation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel network generation method for evaluating within-network classifiers, which consists of two generation phases. In the first phase of topology generation, network topology can be obtained by incorporating any existing topology generation models. In the second phase of label generation, we model the problem as a multi-objective optimization. Specifically, we prove that generating node labels over an existing topology conforming homophily constraint is NP-hard, and devise a genetic algorithm based strategy for node label generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce synthetic networks with stable properties, and ensure that the network topology is fixed and label parameters take effect independently, thus making it sufficient for evaluating the sensitivity of classifiers against different parameters.

In particular, we derive comparative statics showing that degree is typically positively related to social group size but negatively related to the size of the overlap across multiple social groups. This is supported by evidence from a Facebook dataset.

    "Abs": "This paper deals with the statistical signal processing over graphs for tracking infection diffusion in social networks. Infection (or Information) diffusion is modeled using the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. Mean field approximation is employed to approximate the discrete valued infection dynamics by a deterministic difference equation, thereby yielding a generative model for the infection diffusion. The infection is shown to follow polynomial dynamics and is estimated using an exact nonlinear Bayesian filter. We compute posterior Cramer-Rao bounds to obtain the fundamental limits of the filter that depend on the structure of the network. The SIS model is extended to include homophily, and filtering on these networks is illustrated. Considering the randomly evolving nature of realworld networks, a filtering algorithm for estimating the underlying degree distribution is also investigated using generative models for the time evolution of the network. We validate the efficacy of the proposed models and algorithms with synthetic data and Twitter datasets. We find that the SIS model is a satisfactory fit for the information diffusion, and the nonlinear filter effectively tracks the information diffusion."

Two estimators for the (common) homophily parameter, beta(0), are developed and their properties studied under an asymptotic sequence involving a single network growing large. The first, tetrad logit (TL), estimator conditions on a sufficient statistic for the degree heterogeneity. The second, joint maximum likelihood (JML), estimator treats the degree heterogeneity {A(i0)}(i=1)(N) as additional (incidental) parameters to be estimated. The TL estimate is consistent under both sparse and dense graph sequences, whereas consistency of the JML estimate is shown only under dense graph sequences."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Scientists may encounter many collaborators of different academic ages throughout their careers. Thus, they are required to make essential decisions to commence or end a creative partnership. This process can be influenced by strategic motivations because young scholars are pursuers while senior scholars are normally attractors during new collaborative opportunities. While previous works have mainly focused on cross-sectional collaboration patterns, this work investigates scientific collaboration networks from scholars' local perspectives based on their academic ages. We aim to harness the power of big scholarly data to investigate scholars' academic-age-aware collaboration patterns. From more than 621,493 scholars and 2,646,941 collaboration records in Physics and Computer Science, we discover several interesting academic-age-aware behaviors. First, in a given time period, the academic age distribution follows the long-tail distribution, where more than 80% scholars are of young age. Second, with the increasing of academic age, the degree centrality of scholars goes up accordingly, which means that senior scholars tend to have more collaborators. Third, based on the collaboration frequency and distribution between scholars of different academic ages, we observe an obvious homophily phenomenon in scientific collaborations. Fourth, the scientific collaboration triads are mostly consisted with beginning scholars. Furthermore, the differences in collaboration patterns between these two fields in terms of academic age are discussed."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Despite the geographically situated nature of most sharing economy tasks, little attention has been paid to the role that geography plays in the sharing economy. In this article, we help to address this gap in the literature by examining how four key principles from human geography-distance decay, structured variation in population density, mental maps, and \"the Big Sort\" (spatial homophily)-manifest in sharing economy platforms. We find that these principles interact with platform design decisions to create systemic biases in which the sharing economy is significantly more effective in dense, high socioeconomic status (SES) areas than in low-SES areas and the suburbs. We further show that these results are robust across two sharing economy platforms: UberX and TaskRabbit. In addition to highlighting systemic sharing economy biases, this article more fundamentally demonstrates the importance of considering well-known geographic principles when designing and studying sharing economy platforms."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "The data-centric impetus and the development of online social networks has led to a significant amount of research that is nowadays more flexible in demonstrating several sociological hypotheses, such as the sentiment influence and transfer among users. Most of the works regarding sentiment classification usually consider text as unique source of information, do not taking into account that social networks are actually networked environments. To overcome this limitation, two main sociological theories should be accounted for addressing any sentiment analysis tasks: homophily and constructuralism. In this paper, we propose Approval Network as a novel graph representation to jointly model homophily and constructuralism, which is intended to better represent the contagion on social networks. To show the potentiality of the proposed representation, two novel sentiment analysis models have been proposed. The first one, related to user-level polarity classification, is approached by presenting a semi-supervised framework grounded on a Markov-based probabilistic model. The second task, aimed at simultaneously extracting aspects and sentiment at message level, is addressed by proposing a novel fully unsupervised generative model. The experimental results show that the proposes sentiment analysis models grounded on Approval Networks are able to outperform not only the traditional models where the relationships are disregarded, but also those computational approaches based on traditional friendship connections."

    "Abs": "Tags are conspicuous attributes of organisms that affect the behaviour of other organisms toward the holder, and have previously been used to explore group formation and altruism. Homophilic imitation, a form of tag-based selection, occurs when organisms imitate those with similar tags. Here we further explore the use of tag-based selection by developing homophilic replicator equations to model homophilic imitation dynamics. We assume that replicators have both tags (sometimes called traits) and strategies. Fitnesses are determined by the strategy profile of the population, and imitation is based upon the strategy profile, fitness differences, and similarity in tag space. We show the characteristics of resulting fixed manifolds and conditions for stability. We discuss the phenomenon of coat-tailing (where tags associated with successful strategies increase in abundance, even though the tags are not inherently beneficial) and its implications for population diversity. We extend our model to incorporate recurrent mutations and invasions to explore their implications upon tag and strategy diversity. We find that homophilic imitation based upon tags significantly affects the diversity of the population, although not the ESS. We classify two different types of invasion scenarios by the strategy and tag compositions of the invaders and invaded. In one scenario, we find that novel tags introduced by invaders become more readily established with homophilic imitation than without it. In the other, diversity decreases. Lastly, we find a negative correlation between homophily and the rate of convergence."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Multiple studies report that male scholars cite publications of male authors more often than their female colleagues do-and vice versa. This gender homophily in citations points to a fragmentation of science along gender boundaries. However, it is not yet clear whether it is actually (perceived) gender characteristics or structural conditions related to gender that are causing the heightened citation frequency of same-sex authors. A bibliometric study on the two leading German communication science journals Publizistik and Medien & Kommunikationswissenschaft was employed to further analyze the causes of the phenomenon. As scholars tend to primarily cite sources from their own area of research, differences among male and female scholars regarding their engagement in certain research fields become relevant. It was thus hypothesized that the research subject might mediate the relationship between the citing and cited authors' genders. A first analysis based on n = 917 papers published in the period from 1970 to 2009 confirmed the expected gender-differences regarding research-activity in certain fields. Subsequently, structural equation modeling was employed to test the suggested mediation model. Results show the expected mediation to be a complementary one indicating that gender homophily in citations is partly due to topical boundaries. While there are alternative explanations for the remaining direct effect, it may suggest that a fragmentation of science along gender boundaries is indeed an issue that communication science must face."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Social media is becoming an increasingly common part of everyday life. Many social media sites (e.g. Facebook, Twitter and Linkedln) support new interpersonal interaction methods, some of which are neither directed nor reciprocated. For example, social media users can read online 'posts' (self-disclosures) of their friends without interacting with those friends. This is vastly different to traditional face-to-face communication. Our study investigated how reading online 'posts' affects relationship development. Using a longitudinal design sampling 243 participants, we focused on the effect of the posts' valence and intimacy. We found that high intimacy posts or negative posts decreased the social attractiveness of the self-discloser. The perception of the posts and the receiver's feelings of homophily to the self-discloser mediated this relationship. Studies of offline interpersonal interaction have found similar results. In offline communication, self-disclosure perception and homophily also mediate relationship outcomes. This suggests that reading posts on social media and interacting in real life trigger similar or identical relationship formation pathways. These results support the argument that passive consumption is a new method of interaction that does not fundamentally change human psychology. While novel, passive consumption is still based on the same principles as offline communication. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Social causality study on human action sequences is useful and important to improve our understandings to human behaviors on online social networks. The redundant indirect causalities and unobserved confounding factors, such as homophily and simultaneity phenomena, contribute to the huge challenges on accurate causal discovery on such human actions. A causal relationship exists between two persons, if the actions of one person are significantly affected by the actions of the other person, while fairly independent of her/his own prior actions. In this paper, we design a systematic approach based on conditional independence testing to detect such asymmetric relations, even when there are latent confounders underneath the observational action sequences. Technically, a group of asymmetric independence tests are conducted to infer the loose causal directions between action sequence pairs, followed by another group of tests to distinguish different types of relationships, e.g., homophily and simultaneity. Finally, a causal structure learning method is employed to output pairwise causalities with redundant indirect causalities eliminated. Empirical evaluations on simulated data verify the effectiveness and scalability of our proposals. We also present four interesting patterns of causal relations found by our algorithm, on real Sina Weibo feeds, including two new patterns never reported in previous studies."

These interactions can either contribute to deliberative practices - characterised by exposure to different opinions, mutual understanding, and reasonableness - or hinder them, resulting in increased homophily and polarisation. Using the theoretical lens of public deliberation, this study investigates attitudinal and cognitive aspects of user conversations on government-managed social media accounts. Drawing on a survey of 417 users of the Chinese social media platform Weibo, our findings show that interactions on social media are mostly non-dialogical and non-creative in nature, and characterised by homophily and polarisation, even though users perceive their interactions as deliberative. Moreover, interactions on government-managed social media are less deliberative than on other platforms. Our findings contribute to research on government social media from the user side, and to practice of government social media management aimed at citizen engagement."

Despite the potential for advancing the science, limited research has focused on mapping the field. We administered an online survey to individuals in the D&I field to assess participants' demographics and expertise, as well as engagement with journals and conferences, publications, and grants. A combined roster-nomination method was used to collect data on participants' advice networks and collaboration networks; participants' motivations for choosing collaborators was also assessed. Frequency and descriptive statistics were used to characterize the overall sample; network metrics were used to characterize both networks. Among a sub-sample of respondents who were researchers, regression analyses identified predictors of two metrics of academic performance (i.e., publications and funded grants). A total of 421 individuals completed the survey, representing a 30.75% response rate of eligible individuals. Most participants were White (n = 343), female (n = 284, 67.4%), and identified as a researcher (n = 340, 81%). Both the advice and the collaboration networks displayed characteristics of a small world network. The most important motivations for selecting collaborators were aligned with advancing the science (i.e., prior collaborators, strong reputation, and good collaborators) rather than relying on human proclivities for homophily, proximity, and friendship. Among a sub-sample of 295 researchers, expertise (individual predictor), status (advice network), and connectedness (collaboration network) were significant predictors of both metrics of academic performance. Network-based interventions can enhance collaboration and productivity; future research is needed to leverage these data to advance the field."

This investigation leads to a reformulation of the problem of salience of a characteristic for association, defined, after Blau (1977) and Skvoretz (1983), in terms of the difference between the actual frequency of intra-group ties and the frequency expected under randomness. The attraction model is then compared with the log-linear model of quasi-independence. The objective of this comparisons is a precise specification of the attraction model's explanatory scope. The paper ends with an illustrative application of the model to GSS data on confiding relations along ethnicity and religious affiliation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We specify conditions under which pure-strategy equilibria exist and characterize both pure-strategy and mixed-strategy equilibria. The resulting equilibrium networks feature clustered connections and homophily. Clustering emerges because if player a is friend with b and b is friend with c, then a's information is likely to be shared indirectly with c anyway, making it less costly for a to befriend c. Homophily emerges because small additional benefits of friendship within a group make linkages and thus information sharing within that group more likely, further increasing the likelihood within-group links.

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Research problem: In the current information age, people are increasingly accustomed to sharing their special interests online and are influenced by the relationships developed from that sharing. The purpose of this study was to better measure peer influence in these online communities. Research questions: 1. How can peer influence in online communities be measured in a way that comprehensively incorporates peer-based characteristics, the homophily effect, and the structural position of a user in the network? 2. Is the method proposed in this study superior to other existing methods? Literature review: Previous literature on measuring online user influence can be classified into two streams: 1. Those that focus on the intrinsic characteristics of social media players to measure peer influence; 2. Those that address social network structure. Relevant computing algorithms include Topic-Based PageRank, Quality-Structure index, and so on. Although the first stream considers a focal peer's intrinsic characteristics, it overlooks the interpeer attraction in terms of similarity and discrepant knowledge among peers. The second stream mostly stresses the structures of social networks to measure network-wide peer influence but underestimates the effect of interpeer attraction that may leverage every diffusion step of peer influence through the network. To fill this research gap, this study proposes a new method of measuring network user influence that incorporates peers' intrinsic factors, interpeer influence factors as homophily effect, and network structure. Homophily refers to the degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are similar with respect to certain attributes. Methodology: From the communication sender-receiver perspective, we developed a computable method that incorporates peer-based characteristics, the homophily effect, and the structural position of a user in the network to measure the social network user influence. Two empirical studies were subsequently conducted in a social network service-based online community and an online professional logistics community to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results and conclusions: The empirical results show that our proposed method provides higher prediction accuracy of user influence rank in an online community than the other existing methods. These findings lay a foundation for future theoretical exploration and provide a useful tool for targeting influential users in online communities such as blogs, bulletin board systems, and forums."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "To provide social exchange on a global level, sharing-economy companies leverage interpersonal trust between their members on a scale unimaginable even a few years ago. A challenge to this mission is the presence of social biases among a large heterogeneous and independent population of users, a factor that hinders the growth of these services. We investigate whether and to what extent a sharing-economy platform can design artificially engineered features, such as reputation systems, to override people's natural tendency to base judgments of trustworthiness on social biases. We focus on the common tendency to trust others who are similar (i.e., homophily) as a source of bias. We test this argument through an online experiment with 8,906 users of Airbnb, a leading hospitality company in the sharing economy. The experiment is based on an interpersonal investment game, in which we vary the characteristics of recipients to study trust through the interplay between homophily and reputation. Our findings show that reputation systems can significantly increase the trust between dissimilar users and that risk aversion has an inverse relationship with trust given high reputation. We also present evidence that our experimental findings are confirmed by analyses of 1 million actual hospitality interactions among users of Airbnb."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "It has recently become possible to study the dynamics of information diffusion in techno-social systems at scale, due to the emergence of online platforms, such as Twitter, with millions of users. One question that systematically recurs is whether information spreads according to simple or complex dynamics: does each exposure to a piece of information have an independent probability of a user adopting it (simple contagion), or does this probability depend instead on the number of sources of exposure, increasing above some threshold (complex contagion)? Most studies to date are observational and, therefore, unable to disentangle the effects of confounding factors such as social reinforcement, homophily, limited attention, or network community structure. Here we describe a novel controlled experiment that we performed on Twitter using 'social bots' deployed to carry out coordinated attempts at spreading information. We propose two Bayesian statistical models describing simple and complex contagion dynamics, and test the competing hypotheses. We provide experimental evidence that the complex contagion model describes the observed information diffusion behavior more accurately than simple contagion. Future applications of our results include more effective defenses against malicious propaganda campaigns on social media, improved marketing and advertisement strategies, and design of effective network intervention techniques."

In this study, we investigate whether we can predict trust relations via a sparse learning model, and propose to build a trust network without trust relations using only pervasively available interaction data and homophily effect in an online world. In particular, we analyze the reliability of predicting trust relations by interaction behaviors, and provide a principled way to mathematically incorporate interaction behaviors and homophily effect in a novel framework, bTrust. Results of experiments on real-world datasets from Epinions and Ciao demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further experiments were conducted to understand the importance of interaction behaviors and homophily effect in building trust networks."

    "Abs": "An academic conference is not only a venue for publishing papers but also a nursery room for new scientific encounters. While previous research has investigated scientific collaboration mechanisms based on the triadic closure and focal closure, in this paper, we propose a new collaboration mechanism named conference closure. Conference closure means that scholars involved in a common conference may collaborate with each other in the future. We analyze the extent to which scholars will meet new collaborators from both the individual and community levels by using 22 conferences in the field of data mining extracted from DBLP digital library. Our results demonstrate the existence of conference closure and this phenomenon is more remarkable in conferences with high field rating and large scale attendees. Scholars involved in multiple conferences will encounter more collaborators from the conferences. Another interesting finding is that although most conference attendees are junior scholars with few publications, senior scholars with fruitful publications may gain more collaborations during the conference. Meanwhile, the conference closure still holds if we control the productivity homophily. Our study will shed light on evaluating the impact of a conference from the social function perspective based on the index of conference closure."

    "Abs": "Most networks, such as those generated from social media, tend to evolve gradually with frequent changes in the activity and the interactions of their participants. Furthermore, the communities inside the network can grow, shrink, merge, or split, and the entities can move from one community to another. The aim of community detection methods is precisely to detect the evolution of these communities. However, evaluating these algorithms requires tests on real or artificial networks with verifiable ground truth. Dynamic networks generators have been recently proposed for this task, but most of them consider only the structure of the network, disregarding the characteristics of the nodes. In this paper, we propose a new generator for dynamic attributed networks with community structure that follow the properties of real-world networks. The evolution of the network is performed using two kinds of operations: Micro-operations are applied on the edges and vertices, while macro-operations on the communities. Moreover, the properties of real-world networks such as preferential attachment or homophily are preserved during the evolution of the network, as confirmed by our experiments."

So it is very significant for society management or marketing strategies to detect emotional communities in social networks. Based on the emotional homophily of users in social networks, it could confirm that users would like to gather together to form communities according to emotional similarity. This paper exploits multivariate emotional behaviors of users to measure users' emotional similarity, then takes advantage of users' emotional similarity as edge weight to remodel an emotional network and detect communities. The detailed process of detecting emotional communities is as follows: 1) an emotional network is constructed and emotional homophily in experimental dataset is verified; 2) both CNM and BGLL algorithms are employed to detect emotional communities in emotional network, and emotional characters of each community are analyzed; 3) in order to verify the superiority of emotional network for detecting emotional communities, 1 unweighted network and 3 other weighted and undirected networks are constructed as comparison. Comparison experiments indicate that the emotional network is more suitable for detecting emotional communities, the users' emotional behaviors are more similar and denser in identical communities of emotional network than the contrastive networks' communities."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Recommender systems have gained much attention due to their great commercial benefits in electronic markets. The quality of the recommendations depends on the quality of the preference model extracted by the recommender system. Recently, latent factor models based on probabilistic matrix factorisation have gained much attention, owing to their superior accuracy over traditional recommender systems and their great efficiency. Although latent factor models are very efficient, they mostly ignore the user preferences over different item feature values. For example, they assume that lower prices are preferred by all users. However, there may be users who believe that a high price comes with better quality or more prestige. Furthermore, according to homophily and social influence in social sciences, similar users in a social network tend to acquire similar tastes through social interactions. Therefore, all components of human preferences including feature value discrepancies are subject to social influence. Moreover, most of the latent factor models ignore the possible dependencies that naturally exist between item features. To tackle these problems, in this paper we propose two novel latent factor models incorporating socially influenced feature value discrepancies, and socially-influenced conditional feature value discrepancies. We test the accuracy of the proposed methods on three well-known benchmark datasets. The extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves significantly higher accuracies than all state of the art traditional, latent factor, and social recommendation models.

Using a case of one leading journal (Human Resource Management), we collected data on 10years of publication, exploring 327 papers, written by 667 authors, which represent 839 ties. Examining individual demographic and institutional characteristics, we developed and tested a set of hypotheses, providing a framework for shaping and guiding future academic research collaborations. Our findings suggest that as albeit the intention, diverse collaboration is still at a low level. This contribution adds to the literature on understanding the factors influencing the type of collaborations that lead to publications in leading journals."

To enable machine learning in such circumstances, one may consider the application of network embedding methods to extract structural information from the network. However, these methods have so far mostly been used in the context of social networks, which differ significantly from road networks in terms of, e.g., node degree and level of homophily (which are key to the performance of many network embedding methods).We analyze the use of network embedding methods, specifically node2vec, for learning road segment embeddings in road networks. Due to the often limited availability of information on other relevant road characteristics, the analysis focuses on leveraging the spatial network structure. Our results suggest that network embedding methods can indeed be used for deriving relevant network features (that may, e.g, be used for predicting speed limits), but that the qualities of the embeddings differ from embeddings for social networks."

    "Abs": "Network embedding algorithms are able to learn latent feature representations of nodes, transforming networks into lower dimensional vector representations. Typical key applications, which have effectively been addressed using network embeddings, include link prediction, multilabel classification and community detection. In this paper, we propose Biased Walk, a scalable, unsupervised feature learning algorithm that is based on biased random walks to sample context information about each node in the network. Our random-walk based sampling can behave as Breath-First-Search (BFS) and Depth-First-Search (DFS) samplings with the goal to capture homophily and role equivalence between the nodes in the network. We have performed a detailed experimental evaluation comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm against various baseline methods, on several datasets and learning tasks. The experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline ones in most of the tasks and datasets."

    "Abs": "Recommendation systems have become an entrenched part of e-market platforms as they help offer personalized user experience, increasing thus loyalty, satisfaction and lifetime value. Although great effort has been devoted to the proposal, implementation and study of recommendation systems approaches, there is still a lot of room for improvement. This work proposes a novel Graph-based Collaborative Filtering approach for recommendation systems. The key idea is to improve the accuracy of Hybrid approaches by basing recommendations on a more refined Homophily (similarity) level. We hypothesize that a user-base is a network of highly similar sub-communities and that any inference should be made on these communities' level rather than on the whole user-base. Furthermore, some users are more embedded in these similarity communities than others. We think that these \"Key-nodes\" can lead to more accurate recommendations than the ones based on aggregations on similar users. The paper also presents a validation of our approach and the computation of the accuracy of its underlying model over the classical MovieLens dataset. The experiment's results indicate significant gain in performance compared to two classical recommendation systems' approaches."

    "Abs": "The study of embedding large information networks into low-dimensional vector spaces has been going on for several years. However, current feature learning methods are not sufficient to simultaneously capture the structural identity and homophily of nodes in the network. We propose Multi-granularity Network Representation Learning (MGNRL), a novel and flexible framework to learn the latent representations of nodes. Firstly, nodes are divided into different granular layers according to their importance by MGNRL, and the neighborhood structures of nodes are considered to encode their similarities. Then a random walk procedure is designed to explore nodes on different granularity layers, and the public goods game theory is introduced to adjust the probability of random walk continuously. MGNRL overcomes the limitations of existing methods by simultaneously capturing the structural identity and homophily of network nodes. Experiments show that MGNRL performs well in many tasks such as visualization, node classification and link prediction."

We first show that the problem is NP-complete in the worst case. We then perform a series of simulations, using random graph models incorporating a homophily factor. In these simulations, we show that a simple greedy algorithm can be quite successful in finding a partition in favor of a specific candidate."

We examine in simulation the effects of social interconnectedness on domain performance metrics such as container outcomes, delay, revenue, collusion, and coercive demands. Results confirm that, when corruption is widespread, localized punitive- or incentive-based policies are weakened, and that the effect of process re-engineering is frustrated when interconnectedness increases beyond a critical point, for two out of three forms of homophily connections.

Jointly estimating all parameters leads to incidental-parameter bias and incorrect inference. As an alternative, we develop an approach based on a sufficient statistic that separates inference on the homophily parameters from estimation of the fixed effects. The estimator is easy to compute and can be applied to both dense and sparse networks, and is shown to have desirable asymptotic properties under sequences of growing networks. We illustrate the improvements of this estimator over maximum likelihood and bias-corrected estimation in a series of numerical experiments. The technique is applied to explain the import and export patterns in a dense network of countries and to estimate a more sparse advice network among attorneys in a corporate law firm."

    "Abs": "Network embedding algorithms that map nodes in a network into a low-dimensional vector space are prevalent in recent years, due to their superior performance in many network-based tasks, such as clustering, classification, and link prediction. The main assumption of existing algorithms is that the learned latent representation for nodes should preserve the structure of the network, in terms of first-order or higher-order connectivity. In other words, nodes that are more similar will have higher probability to connect to each other. This phenomena is typically explained as homophily in network science. However, there is another factor usually neglected by the existing embedding algorithms, which is the popularity of a node. For example, celebrities in a social network usually receive numerous followers, which cannot be fully explained by the similarity of the two users. We denote this factor with the terminology \"social rank\". We then propose a network embedding model that considers both of the two factors in link generation, and learn proximity-based embedding and social rank-based embedding separately. Rather than simply treating these two factors independent with each other, a carefully designed link generation model is proposed, which explicitly models the interdependency between these two types of embeddings. Experiments on several real-world datasets across different domains demonstrate the superiority of our novel network embedding model over the state-of-the-art methods."

    "Abs": "Homophily - our tendency to surround ourselves with others who share our perspectives and opinions about the world is both a part of human nature and an organizing principle underpinning many of our digital social networks. However, when it comes to politics or culture, homophily can amplify tribal mindsets and produce \"echo chambers\" that degrade the quality, safety, and diversity of discourse online. While several studies have empirically proven this point, few have explored how making users aware of the extent and nature of their political echo chambers influences their subsequent beliefs and actions. In this paper, we introduce Social Mirror, a social network visualization tool that enables a sample of Twitter users to explore the politically-active parts of their social network. We use Social Mirror to recruit Twitter users with a prior history of political discourse to a randomized experiment where we evaluate the effects of different treatments on participants' i) beliefs about their network connections, ii) the political diversity of who they choose to follow, and iii) the political alignment of the URLs they choose to share. While we see no effects on average political alignment of shared URLs, we find that recommending accounts of the opposite political ideology to follow reduces participants' beliefs in the political homogeneity of their network connections but still enhances their connection diversity one week after treatment. Conversely, participants who enhance their belief in the political homogeneity of their Twitter connections have less diverse network connections 2-3 weeks after treatment. We explore the implications of these disconnects between beliefs and actions on future efforts to promote healthier exchanges in our digital public spheres."

Our mathematical analysis demonstrates the existence of an algorithmic glass ceiling that exhibits all the properties of the metaphorical social barrier that hinders groups like women or people of color from attaining equal representation. What raises concern is that our proof shows that under fixed minority and homophily parameters the algorithmic effect is systematically larger than the glass ceiling generated by the spontaneous growth of social networks. We discuss ways to address this concern in future design."

We show how key linguistic variables measured in individual Twitter streams depend on factors like socioeconomic status, location, time, and the social network of individuals. We found that (i) people of higher socioeconomic status, active to a greater degree during the daytime, use a more standard language; (ii) the southern part of the country is more prone to use more standard language than the northern one, while locally the used variety or dialect is determined by the spatial distribution of socioeconomic status; and (iii) individuals connected in the social network are closer linguistically than disconnected ones, even after the effects of status homophily have been removed. Our results inform sociolinguistic theory and may inspire novel learning methods for the inference of socioeconomic status of people from the way they tweet."

Intuitively, when considering venues to visit, users may rely on their past observed visit histories as well as some latent attributes associated with the venues. In this paper, we therefore propose a check-in prediction model based on a neural framework called Preference and Context Embeddings with Latent Attributes (PACELA). PACELA learns the embeddings space for the user and venue data as well as the latent attributes of both users and venues. More specifically, we use a probabilistic matrix factorization-based technique to infer the latent attributes specific to users and locations in location-based social networks (LBSNs), considering the user visitation decisions that could be affected by area attraction, neighborhood competition, and social homophily. PACELA also includes a deep learning neural network to combine both embedding and latent features to predict if a user performs check-in on a location. Our experiments on three different real world datasets show that PACELA yields the best check-in prediction accuracy against several baseline methods."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "In most real-world systems units are interconnected and can be represented as networks consisting of nodes and edges. For instance, in social systems individuals can have social ties, family or financial relationships. In settings where some units are exposed to a treatment and its effects spills over connected units, estimating both the direct effect of the treatment and spillover effects presents several challenges. First, assumptions on the way and the extent to which spillover effects occur along the observed network are required. Second, in observational studies, where the treatment assignment is not under the control of the investigator, confounding and homophily are potential threats to the identification and estimation of causal effects on networks. Here, we make two structural assumptions: i) neighborhood interference, which assumes interference to operate only through a function of the the immediate neighbors' treatments, ii) unconfoundedness of the individual and neighborhood treatment, which rules out the presence of unmeasured confounding variables, including those driving homophily. Under these assumptions we develop a new covariate-adjustment estimator for treatment and spillover effects in observational studies on networks. Estimation is based on a generalized propensity score that balances individual and neighborhood covariates across units under different levels of individual treatment and of exposure to neighbors' treatment. Adjustment for propensity score is performed using a penalized spline regression. Inference capitalizes on a three-step Bayesian procedure which allows taking into account the uncertainty in the propensity score estimation and avoiding model feedback. Finally, correlation of interacting units is taken into account using a community detection algorithm and incorporating random effects in the outcome model. All these sources of variability, including variability of treatment assignment, are accounted for in the posterior distribution of finite-sample causal estimands."

To model the contagion of physical activity, an adaptive temporal-causal network model was designed, and accordingly, the parameters of the model were tuned using empirical data obtained from Twitter. Two variants of the adaptive temporal-causal network model were created, in which one calculated the weights of the connections between the nodes based on follow relations on Twitter, while in the other the connection weights were modulated by the homophily principle. The results indicate that within the considered social network of already active persons homophily does not play an important role in the physical activity behaviour."

We also show that homophily in level of criminality generally holds, but there are strong exceptions that deserve police attention. Copresence networks also arise naturally in other domains such as border protection and intelligence surveillance, so the techniques described here are also applicable in those domains."

Graph assortativity or Modularity is the most accepted measure for the homophily level of the whole network. It is well defined for simple networks where each node has a single type, and edges are unweighted.In this work, we extend modularity and assortativity in several ways. First, we define type assortativity which measures the homophily level of each type and enable the comparison between types of different size within the network. Second, we extend the measures to the case of nodes with multiple types and weighted edges. We evaluate our definitions on a weighted, research collaboration, social network between the most cited authors in the ACM digital library. We use nationality-based multiple types where a author can belong to multiple nationalities. While nationality-based homophily is trivial when the network is large (based on local research at universities) our empirical results show that even for the top 1000 authors a high level of nationality-based homophily exists, and different nationalities exhibit a different level of homophily."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Mastering the dynamics of social influence requires separating, in a database of information propagation traces, the genuine causal processes from temporal correlation, i.e., homophily and other spurious causes. However, most studies to characterize social influence, and, in general, most data-science analyses focus on correlations, statistical independence, or conditional independence. Only recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in \"causal data science,\" e.g., grounded on causality theories. In this paper we adopt a principled causal approach to the analysis of social influence from information-propagation data, rooted in the theory of probabilistic causation.Our approach consists of two phases. In the first one, in order to avoid the pitfalls of misinterpreting causation when the data spans a mixture of several subtypes (\"Simpson's paradox\"), we partition the set of propagation traces into groups, in such a way that each group is as less contradictory as possible in terms of the hierarchical structure of information propagation. To achieve this goal, we borrow the notion of \"agony\" [ 26] and define the Agony-bounded Partitioning problem, which we prove being hard, and for which we develop two efficient algorithms with approximation guarantees. In the second phase, for each group from the first phase, we apply a constrained MLE approach to ultimately learn a minimal causal topology. Experiments on synthetic data show that our method is able to retrieve the genuine causal arcs w.r.t. a ground-truth generative model. Experiments on real data show that, by focusing only on the extracted causal structures instead of the whole social graph, the effectiveness of predicting influence spread is significantly improved."

To date, existing methods mainly focus on network structure information and cannot leverage abundant label information, which is potentially valuable in learning better vector representations. Due to the noise and incompleteness of label information, it is intractable to integrate label information into the vector representations in a partially labeled network. To address this issue, we investigate the effects of label information based on the label homophily. Briefly, label homophily can not only drive nodes sharing similar labels to be connected to each other, but also produce a division of a network into densely-connected, homogeneous parts that are weakly connected to each other. Furthermore, we propose a novel Label Homophily Oriented Network Embedding (LHONE) model to make the best of label homophily by converting a partially labeled network to two bipartite networks, and learning vector representations combined with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Extensive experiments on two real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness of LHONE compared to state-of-the-art network embedding approaches."

BOSSS iteratively filters, navigates, and summarizes diverse open-source data to characterize a local population's social structure, conflicts, cleavages, affinities, and animosities. BOSSS automatically scrapes open-access data from the web and performs natural language processing to populate a knowledge graph with a custom schema. BOSSS then mines the graph to extract key, theory-agnostic social-science principles of human inter-relations and dynamics - homophily, stratification, sentiment, and conflict. Automated quantitative social-network analysis provides up-to-date indicators of trends or anomalies within the local population's social landscape. BOSSS' s emerging technology will provide a dramatic reduction in the cognitive workload for the next generation of analysts and will facilitate more rapid situational awareness both for deployed soldiers and private companies conducting operations abroad."

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose this twofold perspective on the silhouette and its extension to deal with multiplex networks. We also define an approximate variant of the multiplex silhouette to speed up its computation on large networks, based on the exploitation of central nodes to be regarded as community representatives. Experimental results performed on benchmark real-world network datasets have revealed that the proposed multiplex silhouette is positively correlated with its approximate version, while the latter proved to be much faster in terms of execution time."

Numerical analysis of proposed model shows that it is possible to obtain scale-invariant structures for corresponding parameters as well as the structures with homogeneous distribution of connections in the layers. Revealed phenomena emerges as the consequence of the self-organization processes related to structure-dynamical self-learning based on homeostasis and homophily, as well as the result of the competition between the network's layers for optimal topology. It was shown that in the mode of partial and cluster synchronization the network reaches scale-free topology of complex nature that is different from layer to layer. However, in the mode of global synchronization the homogeneous topologies on all layer of the network are observed. This phenomenon is tightly connected with the competitive processes that represent themselves as the natural mechanism of reaching the optimal topology of the links in variety of real-world systems."

    "Abs": "Current Research Information Systems (CRISs) offer great opportunities for assessments of institutional research outputs and extraction of useful and actionable knowledge based on various data-analysis techniques. However, many of these opportunities have not been explored in depth, especially in culture-sensitive areas such as gender-based analysis of research productivity and collaboration. In this paper we present GERBER, a network-based methodology and accompanying tool for gender-based analysis of publication data stored in institutional CRISs. GERBER relies on statistically robust techniques applied on weighted co-authorship networks whose nodes are enriched with different types of researcher evaluation metrics. The functionality of GERBER is demonstrated on publication data stored in the institutional CRIS of the Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Serbia. The obtained results show that GERBER enables institutional research managers and policy makers to detect gender inequalities and homophily in research productivity and collaboration. Finally, we discuss different possibilities to integrate GERBER with CRISs in order to facilitate continuous gender-based evaluation of researchers."

    "Abs": "Detecting communities of interest is a complex problem that has been addressed from different perspectives. In this work, we propose a user-centered approach incorporating social user profiles in community detection for online Social Networks. In our approach, we first compute explicit knowledge acquisition. By exploring the egocentric networks of users, we can infer implicit similarities of interest. The similarity is estimated with reference to homophily and social influence. The latter is leveraged to enhance Sentiment Analysis within communities. Finally, we conduct experiments on datasets extracted from real-world Social Networks."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "The growing significance of social media among potential voters has been recognized by politicians because social media provides a direct method for political actors to connect with their citizens and organize them into online clusters through their use of hashtags. However, with few exclusions, most of the former studies stressed on the identification of personal tweets or cumulative properties of a mass of tweets and political fondness of discrete users, not on partisan public in the U.S. Thus, there is a lack of complete understanding about online social network of politically conflicting public and the public discourse in the network. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate how people adopt political information on Twitter via hashtag as a networked public and how people facilitate political communication among users with similar or disparate political orientations. This study confirmed the theory of homophily in adopting political hashtags on Twitter network. The referred media and highly mentioned domains for each network also support the concept of homophily. The manually examined users with top betweenness centralities were identified as opinion leaders and their tweeting patterns provide evidences that they play key roles in disseminating information through eWOM by occupying an important relational spot in the network."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "The number of communications and messages generated by users on social media platforms has progressively increased in the last years. Therefore, the issue of developing automated systems for a deep analysis of users' generated contents and interactions is becoming increasingly relevant. In particular, when we focus on the domain of online political debates, interest for the automatic classification of users' stance towards a given entity, like a controversial topic or a politician, within a polarized debate is significantly growing. In this paper we propose a new model for stance detection in Twitter, where authors' messages are not considered in isolation, but in a diachronic perspective for shedding light on users' opinion shift dynamics along the temporal axis. Moreover, different types of social network community, based on retweet, quote, and reply relations were analyzed, in order to extract network-based features to be included in our stance detection model. The model has been trained and evaluated on a corpus of Italian tweets where users were discussing on a highly polarized debate in Italy, i.e.the 2016 referendum on the reform of the Italian Constitution. The development of a new annotated corpus for stance is described. Analysis and classification experiments show that network-based features help in detecting stance and confirm the importance of modeling stance in a diachronic perspective."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Homophily - tendency for people to form social connections with similar others - is one of the key topics in social network analysis. It indicates to what extent people tend to be similar to their friends and in what dimensions. For the long time homophily was just an index of the social similarity, but for the recent years the interest for the homophily formation, dynamics and multidimensionality increased. In this paper we investigate the homophily in such social constructed behavior as food consumption and academic achievements. The study of body mass index in social network context reveals the presence of homophily, which means that persons with similar constitution are more likely to be interconnected with each other. Interestingly, that healthy food consumption has no impact on social network formation, but there is homophily based on fast food consumption. Thus, 'bad habits' are stronger forces for the social ties formation. This results show that social constructed behavior is an important component on the process of social network formation."

    "Abs": "In recent years, with the rapid development of Internet, more and more users shop and socialize online, which produces a large amount of traffic data. Analyzing users' online shopping behavior is important for merchants to improve profit. Social networks are widely used in studying the relationship among users. In this paper, we apply the concept of social networks to online shopping behavior, and present a novel network perspective on the interconnected nature of online interest and product, allowing us to capture the attribute of online products reflecting users' sociability. Sociability in this paper is not a traditional social connection but common interests(defined by produce visiting behavior) among users. First, we build an interconnected online interest-product network which includes online shopping based social network (OSSN), online product network and intermediate layer, and we define popular online products and non-popular online products according to the number of distinct visitors of one product. Then, we analyze some indicators about OSSN, and find that OSSN has similar characteristics with traditional social networks, such as small world feature and homophily. Finally, we analyze how online products reflect users' sociability. With the number of online products users have visited increasing, the number of neighbors with similar interests first presents a positive correlation, and then disappears, which implies that the number of users' neighbors depends on the attribute of online products rather than the number of online products users have browsed. We define a formula to measure the attribute of online products reflecting users' sociability, and find that there is a distinct difference among different categories of online products, and non-popular online products often have high value of attribute to reflect users' sociability and the value is low in popular online products."

    "Abs": "The article provides an empirical analysis of the online public sphere in the three dimensions introduced by Dahlgren (2005): structural, representational and interactional. The main subject of analysis is the largest social networking site - Facebook - and Polish users' activity on the Facebook Pages of political parties and politicians. The researchers analysed data about all users active on those Pages during two 4-month periods in 2013 and 2015. The results of the study show that only a small fraction of Facebook users are active in public political discussions that take place on political Facebook Pages (structural dimension). However, the level of engagement depends on the current political events taking place within the public sphere offline, and users are more active during electoral campaigns. Moreover, Facebook does not provide an alternative public sphere for political actors that are less present in mainstream media. Parties and politicians that are visible in traditional media are also attracting active fans in social media (representational dimension). Nonetheless, non-parliamentary groups have more active fans than would result only from their popularity in mainstream media. Finally, the online public on Facebook is fragmented and clustered into homogenous political groups (interactional dimension), thus supporting the hypothesis on echo chambers' presented by Sunstein (2001). The divisions are smaller when there are significantly more users involved. However, most of these cross-cutting links are the result of the electoral campaign."

    "Abs": "Community plays an important role in shaping a network. Quantitatively interpreting a community is necessary for graph generalization which is used for privacy preserving, summarization, and dimensionality reduction in social network mining. However, there are few works in community detection focusing on making sense of the identified communities. In this paper, we study communities in the social media context and investigate structure-based communities from the perspective of community topical homophily. We train Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model to capture the topics in the aggregated tweets of each user in a community and propose new distance metrics to quantify the topic similarity of individual users, cliques, and communities. By building a Twitter topic modeling system to interpret the communities identified by two community detection algorithms in a large scale Twitter topology, we discover evidence that Twitter users in a community show common interests in general. The major contributions of this paper lie in that it verifies the topical homophily in structure-based social media communities and proposes new metrics to quantitatively label the degree of the homophily and describe the theme of the communities."

The purpose of this paper is to explore this relationship by examining the mediation of message on the impact of perceived source characteristics from the perspective of the receiver. The paper also considered the mutual relationships between source characteristics and message quality.Design/methodology/approach A quantitative survey of prospective students was conducted to empirically examine the proposed conceptual model. A sample of 509 respondents was analysed using structural equation modelling.Findings The findings suggest the significant impact of expertise, trustworthiness, homophily and opinion leadership of the WOM source on the judgement of message quality and the indirect effects on WOM influence mediated by the message quality. The results also indicate the moderating effects of receiver involvement and the valence of the message on the impact of message quality.Practical implications The findings of this paper can inform the strategic development of WOM marketing. A deeper understanding of source characteristics and the role of the message may enable marketing practitioners to better target appropriate influencers for seeding programmes that stimulate WOM communication about their brands or products.Originality/value This study examines how the receiver's evaluations of message content mediate the relationship between source characteristics and WOM influence. Source and message are two elements of communication which are processed when people receive information. However, nascent research examines their effects on each other. This research contributes to the understanding of this relationship through an empirical examination of the direct effects of primary source characteristics on perceived message quality."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Purpose As a new communication paradigm, social networking sites (SNS) have boosted information diffusion and viral marketing. Prior researchers have identified various factors affecting information dissemination on SNS. However, they often focus on limited factors and there is a lack of an integrated theoretical framework that explains aspects of relevant factors. Besides, the research on the impacts of relationships on individual retweeting behavior is still controversial. The purpose of this paper is to propose a theoretical framework to systematically investigate the determinants of individual dissemination behavior on SNS based on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). Moreover, the authors also examine the relative importance of those relevant factors.Design/methodology/approach The authors randomly selected 1,250 members of Twitter and crawled posts published by each member since he/she created the Twitter account using Twitter API. The authors processed the data to create panel data and tested hypotheses with the panel logit model.Findings Factors both on the central route and on the peripheral route of ELM have positive impacts on individual dissemination behavior. Among them, information receiver-related factor and relationships-related factors are the most influential. Contrastingly, source-related factors are the least influential. Furthermore, the authors find that social tie strength mediates almost 50 percent of the effect of value homophily on individual dissemination behavior.Originality/value The authors are the first to directly apply ELM to examine individual dissemination behavior on SNS. By integrating factors into the two information processing routes, They incorporate relevant factors into the model and systematically analyze their impacts on individual retweeting behavior on SNS. The research offers at least one explanation for the contradictory findings about the effect of homophily on individual sharing behavior in previous research. The authors propose new variables that gauge topical relevance and interpersonal value homophily on SNS."

    "Abs": "People tend to associate with other people whose qualities are similar to their own. This phenomenon is the so-called \"like attracting like\", or the \"homophily\", in social networks. This paper presents a model that simulates how individuals in social networks with homophily make decisions as a result of the empathic effect, which refers to influence by the decisions of friends or the populations of social networks of which they are a member. In this study, experiments were conducted using Monte Carlo simulation to test a particular decision-making preference (such as asking a question in a Facebook group) and Chi-square tests were conducted to see whether the distribution of people's final choices is the same as that of people's intrinsic choices. Experimental results show that under each the following conditions, individuals are less likely to experience the empathic effect, meaning that they are less likely to change their intrinsic choices: (1) the social network exhibits a more homophily; (2) decision-makers have more options from which to choose, and (3) individuals have fewer friends."

To effectively exploit such huge online resources by using incomplete user profiles, which are very common on social media sites and can be caused by user privacy settings, it is meaningful to explore user profile identification methods. In this paper, we focus on gender identification using reposting behaviors on social networks. Whereas most existing works rely on pure statistical methods, we propose a scheme that is underpinned by homophily and four intuitive methods based on it by combining knowledge of statistics and sociology. For our data set, which was obtained from Sina Weibo and contained 1039 test samples and 528k user profiles, our methods perform with 86.7% accuracy. We explore the sensitivity of our methods on the scale of the data set and find surprisingly competitive results surpassing the binary classification baseline.

SmartPLS 3 statistical software for partial least squares structural equation modeling was chosen as the most adequate technique for the assessment of models with both composites and reflective constructs.Findings - More than 52 percent of the variance in social network development was explained by the advanced similarity model. Each dimension had a positive effect on Facebook social networks development, the highest influences being exerted by condition similarity, context similarity and consequence similarity.Research limitations/implications - The current approach is substantively based on the homophily paradigm in explaining social network development. Future research would benefit from comparing and contrasting complementary theories (e.g. the rational self-interest paradigm, the social exchange or dependency theories) with the current findings. Also, the research is tributary to a convenience-based sample of Romanian college students which limits the generalization of the results to other cultural contexts and, thus, invites further research initiatives to test the model in different settings.Social implications - Similarity attributes and mechanisms consistently determine the dynamics of online social networks, a fact which should be investigated in depth in terms of the impact of new technologies among young people.Originality/value - This study is among the first research initiatives to approach similarity structures and processes within an integrative framework and to conduct the empirical analysis beyond US-centric samples."

Making use of a comparative dataset of the Twitter discussion activities of 115 political groups in 26 countries, it shows that groups that are further apart in ideological terms interact less, and that groups that sit at the extremes of the ideological scale are particularly likely to have lower patterns of interaction. Indeed, exchanges between centrists who sit on different sides of the left-right divide are more likely than connections between centrists and extremists who are from the same ideological wing. In light of the results, theory about exposure to different ideological viewpoints online is enhanced."

    "Abs": "Scientific collaboration is essential in solving problems and breeding innovation. Coauthor network analysis has been utilized to study scholars' collaborations for a long time, but these studies have not simultaneously taken different collaboration features into consideration. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to analyze the differences in possibilities that two authors will cooperate as seen from the effects of homophily, transitivity, and preferential attachment. Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are applied in this research. We find that different types of publications one author has written play diverse roles in his/her collaborations. An author's tendency to form new collaborations with her/his coauthors' collaborators is strong, where the more coauthors one author had before, the more new collaborators he/she will attract. We demonstrate that considering the authors' attributes and homophily effects as well as the transitivity and preferential attachment effects of the coauthorship network in which they are embedded helps us gain a comprehensive understanding of scientific collaboration."

A growing geometric hypergraph built on a cluster of concentric circles is proposed to model two specific collaboration behaviors, namely the behaviors of research team leaders and those of the other team members. The model successfully predicts the transitions, as well as many common features of coauthorship networks. Particularly, it realizes a process of deriving the complex scale-free property from the simple yes/no decisions. Moreover, it provides a reasonable explanation for the emergence of transitions with the difference of collaboration behaviors between leaders and other members. The difference emerges in the evolution of research teams, which synthetically addresses several specific factors of generating collaborations, namely the communications between research teams, academic impacts and homophily of authors."

    "Abs": "Recommender systems have been comprehensively analyzed in the past decade and made great achievement in various fields. Generally speaking, the recommendation of information of interests is based on the potential connections among users and items implied in 'User-Item Matrix'. However, the existing algorithm for recommendation will be degraded and ever fail in the case of sparseness of matrix. To resolve this problem, a new algorithm called B-NMF (blocks-coupled non-negative matrix factorization) is proposed in this paper. With this algorithm: (1) the reconstruction performance of matrix of extreme sparseness is improved as a result of blocking the matrix and modeling based on full use of the coupling between blocks; (2) the coupling between different blocks is ensured via a coupling mechanism that imposes constraints on consistency as the matrix is decomposed. In addition, we provide an approach to exploiting homophily effect in prediction via homophily regularization and thus, the coupling between blocks is improved via extra homophily regularization constraints. Experiment results show that our solution is superior to the existing ones in dealing with the problem of extremely sparse matrix. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

OSN framework postulates that individuals consider the websites to be primary \"actors\" and develop social relationships with the websites themselves rather than the other online participants. This study proposes and empirically tests an integrative model of three social network constructs associated with the website (i.e., tie strength, homophily, and source credibility) and their relationship to consumers' evaluations associated with attitudes and perceived influence of eWOM effectiveness. An online survey with a sample size of 793 respondents revealed that the homophily and tie strength between a website and a consumer are important drivers of source credibility, which in turn influence attitude toward the reviews as well as the website. The attitudes formed through the perceptions of tie-strength, homophily and source credibility ultimately determines the influence of eWOM consumers' purchase decisions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Many organisations are confronted with challenges in getting employees to effectively participate in information and knowledge sharing (IKS). Further, IKS is embedded in multifaceted social contexts, which are influenced by several different social and cognitive factors. This study is in support of the hypothesis that perceived trustworthiness is widely implicated as a mediating factor between those social-cognitive factors and IKS. Previous work, however, uncovered only a handful of such mediating effects. It is argued here that the paucity may have been due to limitations of the statistical methods. This study employs PROCESS, a more powerful current method for mediation analysis in an attempt to uncover previously hidden relationships. Analyses were performed on data collected from 275 knowledge workers (legal professionals and paralegals) engaged in shared legal project work, at one of Canadas largest multijurisdictional law firms. Social-cognitive factors that were considered were shared language, shared vision, tie strength, age/gender/educational homophily and relationship length. IKS outcomes were willingness to share, willingness to use and perceived receipt of useful information/knowledge. Consistent with the hypothesis, the more powerful method revealed a large number of significant mediating effects of perceived trustworthiness. Out of possible 112 simple mediation models, 62 were significant, 44 of which had been previously undiscovered. The results highlight the importance of trust as well as the power of current methods for mediation analysis and serve as a strong argument for their use. The paper concludes with implications for research and practice."

    "Abs": "Relying on a novel integration of both survey data (N = 3629) and egocentric social network interviews (N = 53), this study explores associations between patterns of social support and online gaming involvement and experience. In both our large survey and network interviews, informants who possess a greater number of \"alters\" (social ties) who support their gaming are more likely to report deriving pleasure from their online play. We also find that intensive or \"hardcore\" gamers show evidence of \"homophily,\" with such players having a greater number of gamer-alters in their \"important person\" social networks and thus a more homogenous social composition. Importantly, more intensively involved gamers' social networks also tend to be less dense and more fragmented. Interpreting the results, we argue that network consensus of social norms may compel garners to both behave and judge their behavior in certain distinctive positive and negative ways. At the same time, garners may also construct different types of networks by surrounding themselves with more supportive and like-minded alters. The employment of an ethnographically derived, mixed methodology allows us to go beyond more standard approaches that often rely on survey data alone. Our method lets us test social network theory hypotheses within gaming-related offline/online networks, ascertaining possible causal processes underlying links between social support and online gaming involvement and experience.

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Inferring users' interests from their activities on social networks has been an emerging research topic in the recent years. Most existing approaches heavily rely on the explicit contributions (posts) of a user and overlook users' implicit interests, i.e., those potential user interests that the user did not explicitly mention but might have interest in. Given a set of active topics present in a social network in a specified time interval, our goal is to build an interest profile for a user over these topics by considering both explicit and implicit interests of the user. The reason for this is that the interests of free-riders and cold start users who constitute a large majority of social network users, cannot be directly identified from their explicit contributions to the social network. Specifically, to infer users' implicit interests, we propose a graph-based link prediction schema that operates over a representation model consisting of three types of information: user explicit contributions to topics, relationships between users, and the relatedness between topics. Through extensive experiments on different variants of our representation model and considering both homogeneous and heterogeneous link prediction, we investigate how topic relatedness and users' homophily relation impact the quality of inferring users' implicit interests. Comparison with state-of-the-art baselines on a real-world Twitter dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our model in inferring users' interests in terms of perplexity and in the context of retweet prediction application. Moreover, we further show that the impact of our work is especially meaningful when considered in case of free-riders and cold start users."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Document network is a kind of intriguing dataset which can provide both topical (textual content) and topological (relational link) information. A key point in modeling such datasets is to discover proper denominators beneath the text and link. Most previous work introduces the assumption that documents closely linked with each other share common latent topics. However, the heterophily (i.e., tendency to link to different others) of nodes is neglected, which is pervasive in social networks. In this paper, we simultaneously incorporate community detection and topic modeling in a unified framework, and appeal to Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to capture the latent semantic correlations between the two heterogeneous factors, community and topic. Despite of the homophily (i.e., tendency to link to similar others) or heterophily, CCA can properly capture the inherent correlations which fit the dataset itself without any prior hypothesis. We also impose auxiliary word embeddings to improve the quality of topics. The effectiveness of our proposed model is comprehensively verified on three different types of datasets which are hyperlinked networks of web pages, social networks of friends, and coauthor networks of publications. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant improvements compared with the current state of the art."

This recovers the venue context and differs from prior work, which geolocats tweets to location coordinates or cities/neighborhoods. First, we conduct empirical analysis to uncover venue and user characteristics for improving geolocation. For venues, we observe spatial homophily, in which venues near each other have more similar tweet content (i.e., text representations) compared to venues further apart. For users, we observe that they are spatially focused and more likely to visit venues near their previous visits. We also find that a substantial proportion of users post one or more geocoded tweet(s), thus providing their location history data. We then propose geolocation models that exploit spatial homophily and spatial focus characteristics plus posting time information. Our models rank candidate venues of test tweets such that the actual posting venue is ranked high. To better tune model parameters, we introduce a learning-to-rank framework. Our best model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that tweets without any location-indicative words can be geolocated meaningfully as well."

Churning hits on the design of the network and the method to assign prices by MNOs, and of course their earnings. Therefore, MNOs try to reduce churn detecting potential churners before they leave the service. Our approach to churn prediction considers each customer individually. Previous research shows that members of the social circle of a subscriber may influence chum. Thus, many scenarios that describe social relations, and in which churning processes could be expected, set an emerging challenge with practical implications. This paper uses the Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) technique to model customers. The model's parameters include demographic and psychographic features as well as usage profiles according to their social behavior considering their customers' profiles. Our model modifies and extends an existing real social network generator algorithm that considers customer's profiles and homophily considerations to create connections. We show that using our approach, groups of customers with greater tendency to churn due to the influence of their social networks can be identified better. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Using a large dataset with individual-level demographic information of almost 60,000 families in contemporary Finland, we analyse the regional variation and cultural assortativity by studying the network between families and the network between kins. For the network of families the largest connected component is found to consist of around 1000 families mostly originated from one single region in Western Finland. We characterize the networks in terms of the basic structural properties. In particular, we focus on the k-cores and the presence of transitive triangles. Clustering in the networks is found to result from homophily by language and religious affiliations. The large network fragments appear to be small-worlds. We also compare the fragments in the kin network with respect to the average coefficient of relationship. The measures of assortativity are able to distinguish the families in terms of their regions of origin. Overall, we distinguish between two patterns of regional effects, the 'metropolitan' and the 'cultural' pattern."

    "Abs": "Identifying the factors that influence academic performance is an essential part of educational research. Previous studies have documented the importance of personality traits, class attendance, and social network structure. Because most of these analyses were based on a single behavioral aspect and/or small sample sizes, there is currently no quantification of the interplay of these factors. Here, we study the academic performance among a cohort of 538 undergraduate students forming a single, densely connected social network. Our work is based on data collected using smartphones, which the students used as their primary phones for two years. The availability of multi-channel data from a single population allows us to directly compare the explanatory power of individual and social characteristics. We find that the most informative indicators of performance are based on social ties and that network indicators result in better model performance than individual characteristics (including both personality and class attendance). We confirm earlier findings that class attendance is the most important predictor among individual characteristics. Finally, our results suggest the presence of strong homophily and/or peer effects among university students."

    "Abs": "We generalize a binary majority-vote model on adaptive networks to its plurality-vote counterpart and analyze the timescale to consensus when voters are given more than two options. When opinions are uniformly distributed in the population of voters in the initial state, we find that the timescale to consensus is shorter than the binary vote model from both numerical simulations and mathematical analysis using the master equation for the three-state plurality-vote model. When intervention such as opinion conversion is allowed, as in the case of sudden change of mind of voter for any reason, the effort needed to push the fragmented three-opinion population in the thermodynamic limit to the consensus state, measured in minimal intervention cost, is less than that needed to push a polarized two-opinion population to the consensus state, when the degree (p) of homophily is less than 0.8. For a finite system, the fragmented three-opinion population will spontaneously reach the consensus state, with faster time to consensus, compared to polarized two-opinion population, for a broad range of p."

By systematically collecting co-occurrences of issues, countries, and organization names from more than a hundred websites, we are able to construct multilayer networks describing, for instance, which issues are related to each other according to which organizations. Our results show that there is a surprising amount of homophily among organizations: organizations of the same type (multilateral, bilateral, private donors, etc.) tend to be co-cited in groups. We also create a taxonomy of issues that are generally mentioned together. Finally, we perform simulations, showing that messages originating from different organizations in the international aid community can have a different reach."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Attributed networks consist of not only a network structure but also node attributes. Most existing community detection algorithms only focus on network structures and ignore node attributes, which are also important. Although some algorithms using both node attributes and network structure information have been proposed in recent years, the complex hierarchical coupling relationships within and between attributes, nodes and network structure have not been considered. Such hierarchical couplings are driving factors in community formation. This paper introduces a novel coupled node similarity (CNS) to involve and learn attribute and structure couplings and compute the similarity within and between nodes with categorical attributes in a network. CNS learns and integrates the frequency-based intra-attribute coupled similarity within an attribute, the co-occurrence-based inter-attribute coupled similarity between attributes, and coupled attribute-to-structure similarity based on the homophily property. CNS is then used to generate the weights of edges and transfer a plain graph to a weighted graph. Clustering algorithms detect community structures that are topologically well-connected and semantically coherent on the weighted graphs. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of CNS-based community detection algorithms on several data sets by comparing with the state-of-the-art node similarity measures, whether they involve node attribute information and hierarchical interactions, and on various levels of network structure complexity."

    "Abs": "Personality homophily remains an understudied aspect of social networks, with the traditional focus concerning sociodemographic variables as the basis for assortativity, rather than psychological dispositions. We consider the effect of personality homophily on one of the biggest constraints to human social networks: geographic distance. We use the Big five model of personality to make predictions for each of the five facets: Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Using a network of 313,669 Facebook users, we investigate the difference in geographic distance between homophilous pairs, in which both users scored similarly on a particular facet, and mixed pairs. In accordance with our hypotheses, we find that pairs of open and conscientious users are geographically further apart than mixed pairs. Pairs of extraverts, on the other hand, tend to be geographically closer together. We find mixed results for the Neuroticism facet, and no significant effects for the Agreeableness facet. The results are discussed in the context of personality homophily and the impact of geographic distance on social connections."

    "Abs": "The exploding popularity of mobile devices enables people to enjoy benefits brought by various interesting mobile apps. However, the ever-increasing data traffic has exacerbated the congestion on current cellular networks, which results in users' dissatisfaction, especially in crowded areas. Hence, how to alleviate data traffic in cellular networks becomes a challenging problem. Traditional methods rely on mobile offloading techniques to deviate the data traffic originally targeted to cellular networks, such as the small cell, Wi-Fi, and opportunistic communication. Unfortunately, mobile users still experience severe congestion when a large number of users request for data. Facing these challenges, we introduce the concept of mobile participation to assist data offloading by leveraging the mobility of users and the social features among a group of users. A mobile caching user, who pre-caches a certain amount of contents, will roam around congested areas to participate in content dissemination in order to satisfy users' requests, which is expected to benefit both himself and users in the crowd simultaneously. To motivate such human-enabled mobile participation for data offloading, a Stackelberg game is deployed with joint considerations on social effect and delay effect. Based on detailed performance analysis, we demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach."

The theory predicts how heterogeneity impacts their onset times and growth profiles and suggests that online extremist groups present a broad distribution of heterogeneity-dependent aggregation mechanisms centered around homophily. The good agreement between the theory and empirical data suggests that existing strategies aiming to defeat online extremism under the assumption that it is driven by a few \"bad apples\" are misguided. More generally, this generalized theory should apply to a range of real-world systems featuring aggregation among heterogeneous objects."

    "Abs": "Using data of attitudes in the Puget Sound region we first identify predispositions in favor of car use (car loving persons and households) and distinguish them from other predispositions favoring other modes (transit and carsharing lovers). Then we explore if like-minded people (homophily) live together and examine heterogeneity within their households. To do this we analyze attitudinal data using multilevel latent class clustering that allows identification of groups of persons and groups of households jointly. Our analysis identifies distinct groups of people with different attitudes towards modes and we do not find strong homophily in attitudes within households. The distinction of attitudes among persons transfers well to the household level giving us the opportunity to identify and test differences among the different attitudinal groups using longitudinal records. We then move to a longitudinal analysis using a small sample of households that participated in more than ten years of the Puget Sound panel survey to explore the sequence of their residential location characteristics, car ownership, and travel. We find in descriptive statistics and in a second application of multilevel cluster models that carpool and transit loyalty persists over time by a portion of car pool and transit lovers. We also find sustained use of cars by car loving households, sustained car use of a neutral in attitudes group, a group of younger households with positive attitudes towards carsharing and sustained car sharing over time, and a possibly disenfranchised older household group lacking access to opportunities. The inclusion in the analysis of the two residential location characteristics (evolution of density and diversity around the household residence) enabled a more complete analysis and a clearer description of household context for both attitudes and behavior."

    "Abs": "Social media have great potential to support diverse information sharing, but there is widespread concern that platforms like Twitter do not result in communication between those who hold contradictory viewpoints. Because users can choose whom to follow, prior research suggests that social media users exist in echo chambers or become polarized. We seek evidence of this in a complete cross section of hyperlinks posted on Twitter, using previously validated measures of the political slant of news sources to study information diversity. Contrary to prediction, we find that the average account posts links to more politically moderate news sources than the ones they receive in their own feed. However, members of a tiny network core do exhibit cross-sectional evidence of polarization and are responsible for the majority of tweets received overall due to their popularity and activity, which could explain the widespread perception of polarization on social media."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Despite the strategic role played by individuals, who act as intermediaries between distinct groups of people, the problem of recommending diverse friends in signed social networks (SSNs) still remains largely unexplored. Our model integrates homophily and diversity to develop an adaptive consensus based framework, which involves fuzzy group decision making analysis by leveraging on the signed social links and underlying users' preferences, to offer lists of connections which are diverse as well as relevant. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we modeled the fuzzy binary adjacency relations between users, thereafter referred as decision makers (DMs), exploiting users' preferences conferred on a set of items, and then higher order fuzzy m-ary adjacency relations are constructed to represent the grade of agreement between a set of m DMs. Further, in order to evaluate the relevance of each decision maker involved in the decision making process, we introduce a novel diversity measure based on the knowledge of socio-psychological theories and the information contained in social and interest links. Next, by employing variable-length genetic algorithm, an idea of adaptive consensus is explored to evolve groups of experts which are highly consensual as well as influential in the social network. Finally, on the basis of opinions gleaned from the members of these groups, sign of unknown links are predicted, thereby generating a top-N recommendations list of diverse friends. Extensive experimental study conducted on Epinions dataset illustrates that our proposed scheme outperforms the traditional graph-based methods."

As compared to English users, Malay users are more likely to seek political information and express their political opinion. In online discussions, we observe language-based homophily within the English and Malay language communities, but there are some cross-cutting interactions between opposing political communities.

Next, we analyzed their political homophily in three scenarios. Firstly, we analyzed the Twitter follow, mention and retweet connections either unidirectional and reciprocal. In the second scenario, we analyzed multiplex connections, and in the third one, we analyzed friendships with similar speeches. Our results showed that negative users, users supporting Trump, and users supporting Hillary had homophily in all analyzed scenarios.

    "Abs": "Comprehensive and quantitative investigations of social theories and phenomena increasingly benefit from the vast breadth of data describing human social relations that is now available within the realm of computational social science. Such data are, however, typically proxies for one of the many interaction layers composing social networks, which can be defined in many ways and are composed of communication of various types (e.g., phone calls, face-to-face communication, etc.). As a result, many studies focus on one single layer, corresponding to the data at hand. Several studies have however shown that these layers are not interchangeable, despite the presence of a certain level of correlation between them. Here, we investigate whether different layers of interactions among individuals lead to similar conclusions with respect to the presence of homophily patterns in a population-homophily represents one of the widest studied phenomenon in social networks. To this aim, we consider a data set describing interactions and links of various nature in a population of Asian students with diverse nationalities, first language and gender. We study homophily patterns, as well as their temporal evolution in each layer of the social network. To facilitate our analysis, we put forward a general method to assess whether the homophily patterns observed in one layer inform us about patterns in another layer. For instance, our study reveals that three network layers-cell phone communications, questionnaires about friendship, and trust relations-lead to similar and consistent results despite some minor discrepancies. The homophily patterns of the co-presence network layer, however, does not yield any meaningful information about other network layers."

With statistical analysis on large-scale data of aligned online and offline human behaviors, we show that behavior spaces are coupled, independent from the specific choice of measurements. The coupling further expands to individual's direct and indirect social contacts. This finding provides insight into understanding homophily in different social systems and further improving the predictability of human online and offline behaviors. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2018"

Specifically, we employ coordination games to represent interactions between individuals in a social network. We represent the problem of community detection as a graph coordination game. We provide a novel and scalable two-phased probabilistic semi-supervised approach to compute an accurate overlapping community structure in the given network.

    "Abs": "In the study of the homophily law of large scale complex networks, we get a combinatorial optimization problem which we call the Max k-Uncut problem. Given an n-vertex undirected graph G = (V, E) with nonnegative weights {we vertical bar e is an element of E} defined on edges, and a positive integer k, the Max k-Uncut problem asks to find a partition (V-1, V-2, ..., V-k} of V such that the total weight of edges that are not cut is maximized. Intuitively, an edge that is not cut connects two vertices with the same or similar attributes since they are in the same part of the partition. Interestingly, the Max k-Uncut problem is just the complement of the classic Min k-Cut problem. For Max k-Uncut, we present a randomized (1 - k/n)(2)-approximation algorithm, a greedy (1 - 2(k - 1/n) approximation algorithm, and an Omega(1/2 alpha)-approximation algorithm by reducing it to Densest k-Subgraph, where alpha is the approximation ratio of the Densest k-Subgraph problem. More importantly, we show that Max k-Uncut and Densest k-Subgraph are in fact equivalent in approximability up to a factor of 2. We also prove an approximation hardness result for Max k-Uncut under the assumption P not equal NP. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Many link prediction methods have been developed to infer unobserved links or predict missing links based on the observed network structure that is always incomplete and subject to interfering noise. Thus, the performance of existing methods is usually limited in that their computation depends only on input graph structures, and they do not consider external information. The effects of social influence and homophily suggest that both network structure and node attribute information should help to resolve the task of link prediction. This work proposes SASNMF, a link prediction unified framework based on non-negative matrix factorization that considers not only graph structure but also the internal and external auxiliary information, which refers to both the node attributes and the structural latent feature information extracted from the network. Furthermore, three different combinations of internal and external information are proposed and input into the framework to solve the link prediction problem. Extensive experimental results on thirteen real networks, five node attribute networks and eight non-attribute networks show that the proposed framework has competitive performance compared with benchmark methods and state-of-the-art methods, indicating the superiority of the presented algorithm."

    "Abs": "During the last ten years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have increased their popularity by becoming part of the real life of users. Despite their tremendous widespread, OSNs have introduced several privacy issues as a consequence of the nature of the information involved in these services. Indeed, the huge amount of private information produced by users of current OSNs expose the users to a number of risks. The analysis of the users' similarity in OSNs is attracting the attention of researchers because of its implications on privacy and social marketing. In particular, the homophily between users could be used to reveal important characteristics that users would like to keep hidden, hence violating the privacy of OSNs' users. Homophily has been well studied in existing sociology literature, however, it is not easily extensible in OSNs due to the lack of real datasets. In this paper, we propose an analysis of similarity of social profiles in terms of movie preferences. Results reveal the presence of homophily between users and its dependence from the tie strength. Moreover, we show that it is possible to profile a user (in our case by considering the age attribute) by exploiting movie preferences."

This work investigates into greater depth a type of model that can produce ideological segregation as a result of polarization depending on the strength of homophily and the ability of users to access similar minded individuals. Whether increased access can induce larger amounts of societal separation is important to investigate, and this work sheds further insight into the phenomenon. Center to the hypothesis of homophilic alignments in friendship generation is that of a discussion group or community. These are modeled and the investigation into their effect on the dynamics of polarization is presented. The social implications demonstrate that initial phases of an ideological exchange can result in increased polarization, although a consensus in the long run is expected and that the separation between groups is amplified when groups are constructed with ideological homophilic preferences."

    "Abs": "Embedding network data into a low-dimensional vector space has shown promising performance for many real-world applications, such as node classification and entity retrieval. However, most existing methods focused only on leveraging network structure. For social networks, besides the network structure, there also exists rich information about social actors, such as user profiles of friendship networks and textual content of citation networks. These rich attribute information of social actors reveal the homophily effect, exerting huge impacts on the formation of social networks. In this paper, we explore the rich evidence source of attributes in social networks to improve network embedding. We propose a generic Attributed Social Network Embedding framework (ASNE), which learns representations for social actors (i.e., nodes) by preserving both the structural proximity and attribute proximity. While the structural proximity captures the global network structure, the attribute proximity accounts for the homophily effect. To justify our proposal, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world social networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art network embedding approaches, ASNE can learn more informative representations, achieving substantial gains on the tasks of link prediction and node classification. Specifically, ASNE significantly outperforms node2vec with an 8.2 percent relative improvement on the link prediction task, and a 12.7 percent gain on the node classification task."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Online consumer reviews offer an unprecedented amount of information for consumers to evaluate services before purchase. We use the dual process theory to investigate consumer perceptions about information helpfulness (IH) in electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) contexts. Results highlight that popularity signals, two-sided reviews, and expert sources (but not source trustworthiness) are perceived as helpful by consumers to assess service quality and performance. Although two-sided reviews exercise a significant influence on perceived IH, their influence on purchase intention was indirectly mediated by IH. IH predicts purchase intention and partially mediates the relationship between popularity signals, source homophily, source expertise, and purchase intention."

    "Title": "A Micro-Foundation of Social Capital in Evolving Social Networks",
    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "A social network confers benefits and advantages on individuals (and on groups); the literature refers to these benefits and advantages as social capital. An individual's social capital depends on its position in the network and on the shape of the network-but positions in the network and the shape of the network are determined endogenously and change as the network forms and evolves. This paper presents a micro-founded mathematical model of the evolution of a social network and of the social capital of individuals within the network. The evolution of the network and of social capital are driven by exogenous and endogenous processes-entry, meeting, linking-that have both random and deterministic components. These processes are influenced by the extent to which individuals are homophilic (prefer others of their own type), structurally opportunistic (prefer neighbors of neighbors to strangers), socially gregarious (desire more or fewer connections) and by the distribution of types in the society. In the analysis, we identify different kinds of social capital: bonding capital refers to links to others; popularity capital refers to links from others; bridging capital refers to connections between others. We show that each form of capital plays a different role and is affected differently by the characteris tics of the society. Bonding capital is created by forming a circle of connections; homophily increases bonding capital because it makes this circle of connections more homogeneous. Popularity capital leads to preferential attachment: individuals who become popular tend to become more and more popular because others are more likely to link to them. Homophily creates inequality in the popularity capital attained by different social categories; more gregarious types of agents are more likely to become popular. However, in homophilic societies, individuals who belong to less gregarious, less opportunistic, or major types are likely to be more central in the network and thus acquire a bridging capital. And, while extreme homophily maximizes an individual's bonding capital, it also creates structural holes in the network, which hinder the exchange of ideas and information across social categories. Such structural holes represent a potential source of bridging capital: non-homophilic (tolerant or open-minded) individuals can fill these holes and broker interactions at the interface between different social categories."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "While analyses of Twitter have shown that it holds democratic potential, it can also provide a venue for hate speech against minorities. The articulation of opinion-based identities, the tendency to homophily, and the use of emotional discourses can indeed help spread verbal violence on Twitter. This paper discusses group polarization on Twitter through Mouffe's distinction of agonistic and antagonistic politics, as elaborated in the 2013 book Agonistic: Thinking the World Politically. The theory is supported by a practical example: a qualitative analysis of Islamophobic tweets sent in the aftermath of the 2016 British referendum on European Union membership, which is commonly referred to as Brexit'. Following the UK's decision to leave the EU, there was a surge of Islamophobic attacks on Twitter. My analysis reveals that anti-Islamic sentiments were articulated in terms of complex identities referring not only to religion but also to ethnicity, politics, and gender. The paper shows that these tweets are antagonistic in character because they prevent the dialogic participation of Muslims and propagate symbolic violence rather than engaging in constructive conflicts."

    "Abs": "The classification of networked data is an interesting and challenging problem. Most traditional relational classifiers that are based on the principle of homophily have an unsatisfactory classification performance in networks with heterophily. This is because these methods treat inhomogeneous networks homogeneously. A progression of a network-only Bayes-classifier-based second-order Markov assumption is proposed for heterophilous networks in this paper to address this problem. First, we estimate the class distribution of an unlabeled node according to the class distribution of its neighbors' neighbors. In this process, we perform this computation on the known and unknown neighbors separately. Second, we combine the two parts using multinomial na i ve Bayesian classification. Meanwhile, we pair a relaxation labeling collective inference method (which imports simulated annealing) with this new method to update the class distributions at each iteration. Comparisons of the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better when the networks are heterophilous."

First, we introduce the Spark implementation of CLSM for parallel computation by fitting the inference algorithm into the map-reduce framework. Second, we consider user reputation besides the network homophily, which also affects social interactions between users. We test CLSM and its extension on two real-world problems: understanding link and user attributes in the location-based social network, and a review-trust network. Our proposed models in Spark can be easily deployed on commercial cloud services, such as Google cloud or Amazon web service and find latent community membership in large-scale datasets. We perform extensive experiments on real-world datasets and show how CLSM extension improves our previous model. We also share meaningful insights we discovered with the datasets."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "As one of the most successful recommendation techniques, collaborative filtering provides a useful recommendation by associating an active user with a crowd of users who share the same interests. Although some achievements have been achieved both in theory and practice, the efficiency of recommender systems has been negatively affected by the problems of cold start and data sparsity recently. To solve the above problems, the trust relationship among users is employed into recommender systems to build a learning model to further promote the prediction quality and users' satisfaction. However, most of the existing social networks-based recommendation algorithms fail to take into account the fact that users with different levels of trust and backgrounds, that is, user's social status and homophily have different degrees of influence on their friends. In this paper, a novel social matrix factorization-based recommendation method is proposed to improve the recommendation quality by fusing user's social status and homophily. User's social status and homophily play important roles in improving the performance of recommender systems. We first build a user's trust relationship network based on user social relationships and the rating information. Then, the degree of trust is calculated through the trust propagation method and the PageRank algorithm. Finally, the trust relationship is integrated into the matrix factorization model to accurately predict unknown ratings. The proposed method is evaluated using real-life datasets including the Epinions and Douban datasets. The experimental results and comparisons demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to the existing social networks-based recommendation algorithms."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "People often have different opinions toward the same topic, posing challenges for traditional sentiment analysis systems that rely on statistical models estimated with population-level data. Personalization is a solution to the problem, but it suffers from data scarcity issue, as the labeled date for a specific user is usually only available in a small quantity. In this paper, we exploit the theory of social homophily to overcome this difficulty by assuming that social neighbors are likely to express similar opinions with respect to the same topic or document. We present a personalized sentiment analysis system that leverages the social relation information to balance between personalization and overfitting. Our approach is based on network lasso that automatically clusters socially proximate users together, so that users in the same group share the same personalized model. We develop a distributed optimization algorithm that makes our system scale to large networks as well. The experiments on Yelp review datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms competitive methods."

    "Abs": "Modeling user check-in behavior helps us gain useful insights about venues as well as the users visiting them. These insights are important in urban planning and recommender system applications. Since check-in behavior is the result of multiple factors, this paper focuses on studying two venue related factors, namely, area attraction and neighborhood competition. The former refers to the ability of a spatial area covering multiple venues to collectively attract check-ins from users, while the latter represents the extent to which a venue can compete with other venues in the same area for check-ins. We first embark on empirical studies to ascertain the two factors using three datasets gathered from users and venues of three major cities, Singapore, Jakarta and New York City. We then propose the visitation by area attractiveness and neighborhood competition (VAN) model incorporating area attraction and neighborhood competition factors. Our VAN model is also extended to incorporate social homophily so as to further enhance its modeling power. We evaluate VAN model using real world datasets against various state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that VAN model outperforms the baselines in check-in prediction task and its performance is robust under different parameter settings."

Previous research shows that MSM have high levels of racial/ethnic homophily (the tendency for people to have sex with others who share the same racial/ethnic identification) in sexual dyads, which may help explain HIV disparities. This study fills a gap in previous research by grounding network data from a cohort study of young MSM in Chicago (RADAR) in the contexts of virtual spaces (VSs) and examining differences in levels of racial/ethnic homophily using multilevel-logistic-regression models. Results show that Grindr differs from other VSs in proportions of racially/ethnically homophilous dyads and by partner racial/ethnic identification. After controlling for general homophily trends, sex partnerships formed on Grindr by Black MSM were significantly less likely to be homophilous than those of White MSM. While racial/ethnic groups differ in likelihood to form homophilous partnerships, this trend varies by VS."

The effect of international connection on performance is compared between US and non-US institutions. The homophily of centrality, tie strength and h-index measured as assortativity coefficient is described to show how institutions of similar properties tend to connect with each other in the graph. Furtherly, a negative binomial regression model is employed to investigate the relationship between the homogenous connections and the citation counts received by the connections. Characteristics of connections that contribute to good performance are then obtained."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "Influence diffusion modelling, analysis and applications in the preference-aware context draw tremendous attention to both researchers and practitioners. Most contemporary studies typically model the influence-diffusion pheromone from a centralized perspective. In this paper, we model the bi-directional influence propagation in directed weighted networks in a distributed manner with the consideration of user preference by facilitating Agent-Based Modelling. In the proposed model, each individual's personalized features and the social context are modelled based on the underlying social theories, i.e.social influence and the homophily effect. In addition, the model is capable of not only producing a certain range of dynamical behaviours based on different parameter constellation but also analyzing the evolutionary trends of a social network and capturing the dynamics in the environment. Another attractive feature is the training capability of agents, which enables them to adapt the personalized features. Comparing with traditional approaches, the proposed model is more suitable for handling the complex nature of influence diffusion, and demonstrates the advantages in simulating the real-world influence diffusion. Furthermore, we propose a novel seeding algorithm for influence maximization, named Enhanced Evolution-Based Backward selection. The algorithm utilizes the advantages offered by the proposed agent-based model. The experimental results reveal that the algorithm is superior to those state-of-the-art algorithms for influence maximization."

The authors explore how professionals use their personal networks to engage in a wide variety of learning activities and examine what social mechanisms influence professionals' agency to form personal informal learning networks.Design/methodology/approach - This study applied a mixed- method approach to data collection. Social network data were gathered among school professionals working in the vocational sector. Ego- network analysis was performed. A total of 24 in- depth, semi- structured, qualitative interviews were analyzed.Findings - This study found that networked individualism is not represented to its full potential in the vocational sector. However, it is important to form informal learning ties with different stakeholders because all types of informal learning ties serve different learning purposes. The extent to which social mechanisms (i. e. proximity, trust, level of expertise and homophily) influence professionals' agency to form informal learning ties differs depending on the stakeholder with whom the informal learning ties are formed.Research limitations/implications - This study excludes the investigation of social mechanisms that shape learning through more impersonal virtual learning resources, such as social media or expert forums. Moreover, the authors only included individual- and dyadic- level socialmechanisms. Practical implications - By investigating the social mechanisms that shape informal learning ties, this study provides insights how professionals can be stimulated to build rich personal learning networks in the vocational sector.Originality/value - The authors extend earlier research with in- depth information on the different types of learning activities professionals engage in in their personal learning networks with different stakeholders. The ego- network perspective reveals how different social mechanisms influence professionals' agency to shape informal learning networks with different stakeholders."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "Previous research has consistently found an effect of the valence (positive vs. negative) of electronic word of mouth in general and of word of mouth on a social networking site (sWOM) specifically on consumer responses. The current study investigates how interpersonal and person-to-site relational characteristics (homophily, tie strength, and source credibility) moderate this effect on consumer responses to sWOM (behavioral and positive word-of-mouth intention). The results show that interpersonal homophily and source credibility both significantly reinforce the effect of sWOM valence on behavioral intention and positive word-of-mouth intention. Only considering person-to-site relational characteristics as antecedents, (person-to-site) homophily and source credibility reinforce the effect of sWOM valence on behavioral intention and on positive word-of-mouth intention. However, including both the interpersonal and the person-to-site relational characteristics as antecedents results in all person-to-site relational characteristics becoming nonsignificant as moderators. This study advances the sWOM literature by concurrently examining how both interpersonal and person-to site relational characteristics moderate the effect of message valence on sWOM responses. The findings imply that marketers should try to stimulate sWOM from credible sources that are homophilous to the target audience, as these relationships reinforce the positive impact of sWOM valence on behavioral intentions."

In this research, an experimental study is done to compare community detection in Facebook friendship network to that of activity network, considering different activities in Facebook OSN such as sharing. Then, a new community detection evaluation metric based on homophily is proposed. Eventually, a new method of community detection based on different activities in Facebook social network is presented.

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "Community in social networks is a nebulous concept. A community is generally assumed to be formed by people who possess similar attributes or characteristics, also known as \"homophily\". Although there has been a lot of research on community detection based on network topology, the semantic interpretation of communities is rarely studied. The present work aims to understand the behavioral similarity of users present in their personal neighborhood communities formed by friends, relatives, or colleagues, and addresses two fundamental questions: (i) Are communities firmed by users who possess similar behavioral traits? If so, does this apply to all those sub-networks, i.e., friends, relatives, and colleagues? (ii) Does adding behavioral node-specific attributes/features to the nodes in a network lead to better community detection? To better understand the psycho-sociological homophilic nature of personal networks, the personalities and values of Twitter users were analyzed using the well-established \"Big-5 personality model\" and \"Schwartz sociological behavior model\". Empirical results based on the psychosociological behavior show that friends networks exhibit homophily, whereas relatives and colleagues networks do not exhibit such homophilic behavior. It can also be observed that neurotic people tend to behave heterogeneously with people of various personality traits. In addition, it is shown that such empirical evidence can be used as features for the tasks of community detection and link prediction."

Large book networks are created by sales (two books are connected if many readers have bought both books) and can recommend new books to buy. The networks are analysed by the gender of their first author: is book consumption assortative by gender?Book networks are indeed gender-assortative: readers globally prefer to read from one author gender (the global assortativity coefficients by gender is around 0.4). Although 33% of first authors among all books are female, female books are not proportionally sold together with male books: an average of 20% (and median of 11%) of books co-bought with male books are female books. Instead, female books make up on average more than half of the books co-bought with other female books.The gender makeup of literary genres and structural book communities show that the gender homophily originates in a gender skew not only in certain literary genres (a fact known from prior studies), but even more strongly in certain book communities, with these book communities spanning multiple literary genres.

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "Collaboration and social networking are increasingly important for academics, yet identifying relevant collaborators requires remarkable effort. While there are various networking services optimized for seeking similarities between the users, the scholarly motive of producing new knowledge calls for assistance in identifying people with complementary qualities. However, there is little empirical understanding of how academics perceive relevance, complementarity, and diversity of individuals in their profession and how these concepts can be optimally embedded in social matching systems. This paper aims to support the development of diversity-enhancing people recommender systems by exploring senior researchers' perceptions of recommended other scholars at different levels on a similar-different continuum. To conduct the study, we built a recommender system based on topic modeling of scholars' publications in the DBLP computer science bibliography. A study of 18 senior researchers comprised a controlled experiment and semi-structured interviewing, focusing on their subjective perceptions regarding relevance, similarity, and familiarity of the given recommendations, as well as participants' readiness to interact with the recommended people. The study implies that the homophily bias (behavioral tendency to select similar others) is strong despite the recognized need for complementarity. While the experiment indicated consistent and significant differences between the perceived relevance of most similar vs. other levels, the interview results imply that the evaluation of the relevance of people recommendations is complex and multifaceted. Despite the inherent bias in selection, the participants could identify highly interesting collaboration opportunities on all levels of similarity."

    "Abs": "Friend recommendation system (FRS) is an essential part of any social network system. With the popularity of social network sites, many FRSs have been proposed in the past few years. However, most of them are homophily based systems, homophily is the propensity to associate and bond with similar others. In other words, these systems will recommend people that you share common features with them as friends. Homophily based FRS is accurate when the common feature is a physical or social feature, such as age, race, location, job, or lifestyle. However, it is not the case with personality types. Having a given personality type does not necessarily mean that you are compatible with people that have the same personality type. Therefore, in this paper, we present and evaluate an FRS based on the big-five personality traits model and hybrid filtering, in which the friend recommended process is based on personality traits and users' harmony rating. To validate the proposed system's accuracy, a personality-based social network site that uses the proposed FRS named PersoNet is implemented. Users' rating results show that PersoNet performs better than collaborative filtering (CF)-based FRS in terms of precision and recall."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "The challenging but intriguing problem of modeling opinion formation dynamics in online social networks (OSNs) has attracted many researchers in recent years because the inherent complexities present in human opinion update process are yet to be clearly understood. Although the existing works adopt the distance-based homophily principle to model the neighbors' influences on the formation of an agent's opinion, they ignore several other key factors that govern the update process. Explicitly, we consider two essential aspects of the real-world opinion formation process that were not explored previously. First, we consider the predisposition of agents that leads to selective exposure to information when presented with different opinion sources. Second, we explicitly consider an agent's past interaction experience with others and how opinions encountered in the past interactions influence future opinion update process of that agent. Although the confidence level of an agent on the expressed opinion was previously used to distinguish an expert, we propose the concept of the relative credibility of the opinion sources for such distinction. For this, we take into account an agent's perceived credibility about others and the relative nature of human judgment when exposed to many opinion sources with different credibility. In addition, for the first time, the credibility of sources external to an OSN is considered in the opinion formation model proposed in this paper. We validate our model by analyzing its performance in capturing the real-world opinion formation dynamics using traces collected from an OSN, specifically Twitter. On the other hand, through simulation, various scenarios are created to observe the steady-state outcomes of the dynamics under various influences of our model parameters and network characteristics. Finally, different compelling and practical applications with social and economic values can be built based on our model."

At the same time, new technologies such as wearable sensors make it possible to collect new types of social network data. We employed RFID tags to capture face-to-face interactions of participants of two consecutive Ph.D. retreats of a graduate school on climate research. We use this data in order to explore how it may support ethnographic observations and to gain further insights on scholarly interactions. The unique feature of the data is the opportunity to distinguish short and long conversations, which often have a different nature from a sociological point of view. Furthermore, an advantage of this data is the availability of socio-demographic, research-related, and situational attributes of participants. We show that, even though an interaction partner is often found rather randomly during coffee breaks of retreats, a strong homophily between participants from the same institutions or research areas exists. We identify cores of the networks and participants who play ambassador roles between communities, e.g., persons who visit the retreat for the second time are more likely to be ambassadors. Overall, we show the usefulness and potential of RFID tags for scientometric studies."

Empirical evaluations of three online real-world datasets suggest that the proposed dynamic model can well predict long-range online user behaviors."

    "Abs": "Social networking sites (SNSs) facilitate self-expression and promote social connections. There has been growing scholarly attention to the affect-charged collectivities created online in the aftermath of disasters and mass traumas. This study was designed to examine how individuals affiliate in SNS-based commemoration of a mass trauma, taking advantage of a large Weibo (the Chinese equivalent of Twitter) data set which captures users' responses over 4 years to the anniversary of the Nanjing massacre, a major traumatic event in Chinese history. Machine learning-based content analysis was combined with dyadic-level network analysis to examine the content Weibo users create and the conversational structures they formed. The results reveal that homophily, geographic proximity, and preferential attachment work in tandem with displays of emotion to influence the formation of online conversational ties. Expressions of negative emotions were found to facilitate or inhibit the homophily effect. Being exposed to the display of anger amplifies the homophily effect among the users, while sadness weakens it. The findings point to the importance of examining specific emotions rather than global (positive-negative) feelings in understanding the dynamics of SNS-based interaction."

Few investigated whether social influence plays an important role in upgrade adoption. Unlike first-time adoption, consumers have gained product experience, so their perceived risks and uncertainty were less than in first-time adoption. To study the roles that social influence plays in first-time versus upgrade adoption, we implemented two experiments. Study 1 involved a lab experiment on whether social influence works in upgrade adoption. Study 2 implemented a field study to identify the effects of peer adoption of virtual goods, with 897,765 participants: 28,730 first-time adopters and 15,056 upgraders. The results offer four findings. First, the results show that social influence affected consumer upgrade decisions. Second, there were different effects of social influence in upgrade adoption: informative influence decays and normative influence rises from first-time to upgrade adoption. Third, the influential adopters (and upgraders) vary across the stages. Well-connected adopters exerted stronger influence than less-connected ones in first-time adoption, and upgraders with higher homophily relative to non-upgraders exerted influence in upgrade adoption. Fourth, the susceptibility to influence of non-adopters (non-upgraders) also varied in the different stages. Less-connected non-adopters were more susceptible in their first-time adoption, while non-upgraders with higher reciprocity were more susceptible in their upgrade decision. These results extend our understanding of social influence, especially in different adoption contexts. This research also can help marketers identify influential adopters to facilitate online marketing campaigns."

    "Year": "",
    "Abs": "NOVELTY - The method involves describing information transmission for extracting Homophily features. Characteristic influence information propagation is introduced. Single propagation mode definition and description are obtained. Judgment is made to check whether network information is forwarded by using a probability model to allow a user to accurately portray an online social network in an information transmission mode. A basic propagation mode is driven. Expectation maximization arithmetic value is maximized to carry out parameter estimation process. Parameter estimation formula is sent. USE - Multi-mode hybrid transmission model based online social network information propagation modeling method. ADVANTAGE - The method enables establishing the probability model in a simple manner to reduce complexity of information propagation modeling and typical propagation mode driving corresponding to basic information transmission process."

    "Title": "Method for managing resources for group of users with common behaviors, involves modifying accessibility of resource with respect to secondary domain for at least other users in group of users based on at least one user behavior",
    "Year": "",
    "Abs": "NOVELTY - The users are categorized (406) according to common user characteristics and common user behaviors with respect to a primary domain to yield a group of users. A resource associated with user behavior is identified (408) in a secondary domain different during a primary time interval for at least one user from the group of users. An accessibility of the resource is modified (410) with respect to the secondary domain for at least other users in the group of users based on the at least one user behavior during a secondary time interval after the primary time interval. USE - Method for managing resources for a group of users with common characteristics and/or common behaviors based on social synchrony and homophily of users. ADVANTAGE - The users in a group based on common user characteristics or common user behaviors generally tend to act in a similar manner. Thus, users in such a group not only perform the same actions, but typically require access to the same resources to perform such actions. The resources can be managed based on user behaviors efficiently, thus improving accessibility of the resources by the users. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:(1) system for managing resources; and(2) non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing program for managing resources. DESCRIPTION Of DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flowchart illustrating a process for managing resource.Resource management process (400)Step for obtaining data indicating users characteristics and users behaviors (404)Step for categorizing users according to common user characteristics and common user behaviors (406)Step for identifying resource associated with at least one user behavior (408)Step for modifying accessibility of resource (410)"

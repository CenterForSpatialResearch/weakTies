Investigating this issue across a range of SMEs, this paper demonstrates that strong ties influence idea development through three mechanisms; endorsement and validation, developing cognizance, and encouraging constructive dissent. These mechanisms positively impact idea development by creating organizational spaces that are primed to critically receive ideas, energize knowledge sharing by better transacting resources across network connections, and drive divergent thinking by disordering, but not fracturing, social spaces.",2019"Gomez-Solorzano, Manuel; Tortoriello, Marco; Soda, Giuseppe",Instrumental and affective ties within the laboratory: The impact of informal cliques on innovative productivity,STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,"Research Summary In this paper, we contribute to research on networks and innovation by distinguishing between instrumental and affective ties and assessing their impact on individual innovativeness. In particular, using original data from the corporate R&D laboratory of a global pharmaceutical company, we evaluate how a specific structural arrangement (i.e., belonging to a clique) affects inventors' innovative productivity. Our results show that both instrumental/knowledge-sharing cliques and affective/friendship cliques correlate positively with inventors' innovative productivity. However, we also observe that when inventors straddle knowledge-sharing and friendship cliques, their innovative productivity declines. Managerial Summary Firms competing in knowledge-intensive industries rely on the productivity of their inventors to develop innovations. Within these firms, inventors' innovative productivity is influenced by the people they interact with and by the benefits and costs associated with maintaining these relationships. We find that inventors' innovative productivity is enhanced by having strong and embedded relationships with their colleagues, regardless of these relationships being based on knowledge-sharing ties or friendship ties. However, when inventors are caught in between strong knowledge-sharing ties and strong friendship ties, their innovative productivity suffers, ultimately hampering the firm's innovative capabilities.",2019"Phillips, Gregory, II; Neray, Balint; Birkett, Michelle; Felt, Dylan; Janulis, Patrick; Mustanski, Brian",Role of Social and Sexual Network Factors in PrEP Utilization Among YMSM and Transgender Women in Chicago,PREVENTION SCIENCE,"Despite demonstrated efficacy, uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) remains low, particularly among high-risk demographics such as transgender women, Black men who have sex with men (BMSM), and young MSM (YMSM). Research thus far has largely focused on individual factors that may impede PrEP uptake in these demographics, leaving social network factors relatively unexplored. The present study used data collected from participants within RADAR, a longitudinal cohort study in Chicago focused on understanding the individual, dyadic, network, social, and biologic factors associated with HIV infection within YMSM. Of the 906 study participants who did not report an HIV diagnosis at baseline, 7.0% reported using PrEP in the prior 6 months. Recent PrEP use was associated with both individual-level (age and gender) and network-level factors (mean relationship strength, sexual network degree, etc.). These findings highlight the need to expand beyond focusing on individual-level drivers of PrEP uptake, as well as changing our understanding of who is most important within a network (centrality vs. strength of weak ties). Future work is needed to determine whether variables associated with PrEP uptake are similarly connected to PrEP adherence.",2019"Zhou, Min",Gender Differences in the Provision of Job-Search Help,GENDER & SOCIETY,"The existing literature has well studied the use of social contacts in job search, including gender inequality, in using social contacts. What is missing is the perspective of social contacts who help others find jobs. Using a large data set from the 2012 China Labor-Force Dynamics Survey, this study reveals significant gender differences in the provision of job-search help. Compared with women, men are more likely to provide job-search help and especially show a greater likelihood of exerting direct influence on the hiring process. While women are gender neutral in their choice of help recipients, men display a selective preference for helping other men. This men's advantage of providing job-search help, especially influence-based help, and men's selective preference for helping other men, imply another prominent gender inequality in informal hiring in the labor market. This study suggests several theoretical propositions to explain the revealed gender differences in both ""whether to help"" and ""whom to help,"" providing a starting point for further research.",2019"Bouchillon, Brandon C.","Patching the Melting Pot: Sociability in Facebook Groups for Engagement, Trust, and Perceptions of Difference",SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPUTER REVIEW,"The more racial or ethnic diversity a person lives around in America, the less likely they are to take part in civic life, or to profess feelings of trust for the average person. Differences have instead become reasons to pull back, prompting a mass erosion of social capital, by undermining social contact. The present study moves the conversation online, to the Facebook group setting in particular, as a means of highlighting shared interests while downplaying other differences at first. Results of a national web survey (N = 1,005) indicate the use of Facebook groups for meeting new people relates to civic participation, along with added weak-tie discussions, which spill over to participation again indirectly. Sociability use of Facebook groups is also a source of bridging social capital, or having more active weak ties upon which to draw, and this contributes to trusting in people. Localized diversity becomes a reason to trust as well, but only for sociable Facebook group users. Less sociable users still mistrust at the sight of difference, but online social efforts appear to swing the direction of influence, for converting neighborhood-level racial and ethnic diversity into trust.",2019"Hadj, Tarek Bel; Ghodbane, Adel",WHAT MATTERS MOST FOR INNOVATION CAPABILITY OF SMES: STRUCTURAL OR COGNITIVE FEATURES OF NETWORKING?,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT,"Our paper aims to analyse the effects of the networking of the entrepreneur on the innovation capability of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). For this purpose, we examine the mediation of the knowledge management in our business model in the relationship between structural and cognitive features of networking and innovation capability. Our results show, in the specific case of 124 entrepreneurs in North African SMEs, that the networking is concretised by innovation capability in the presence of a partial mediation of the knowledge management for cognitive features, and a full mediation for structural features. The originality of research lies in the formulation of networking-based entrepreneurship model in which the reinforcement of innovation capability of SME is conditioned by knowledge management, which is facilitated by structural and cognitive features of networking.",2019"Yang, V.

A difficulty in understanding the mechanism of this phenomenon is that different outputs differ considerably in their scaling behaviors. Here, we formulate a physics-based model for the origin of superlinear scaling in urban outputs by treating human interaction as a random process. Our model suggests that the increased likelihood of finding required collaborations in a larger population can explain this superlinear scaling, which our model predicts to be non-power-law. Moreover, the extent of superlinearity should be greater for activities that require more collaborators.

Using ordered logit and sequential logit models, our results show that in the adoption process, households benefit from weak ties of social groups such as religious group and informal saving group for the adoption of mobile money. We equally find that being client of banks or microfinance institutions act as powerful channels from one step to another in the process. Besides, our findings reveal that households whoever use mobile money seem to be more resilient to climatic shocks such as drought, irregular rain, soil degradation, erosion and fertility reduction and to shock that affect households' assets (non-climatic: high prices of agricultural inputs).

Firms situated within innovation networks require specific abilities to acquire the knowledge and the complementary assets that facilitate their innovation performance. Motivated by recent research studies in the area of social network and RBV, the purpose of this paper is to improve the understanding of the precise manner in which network capability affects a firm's innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach Based on the data obtained from Chinese high-tech firms, the hypotheses are tested by using hierarchical multiple regressions. Findings This study identifies two types of network capabilities: network structural capability and network relational capability. The findings suggest that network structural capability has a greater positive impact on innovation performance than network relational capability does within an exploration-orientated network. However, network relational capability is more positively associated with innovation performance within an exploitation-orientated network. Originality/value This paper contributes to strategic management theory and social network theory by illustrating how a networked firm can enable network value and appropriate this value according to its strategic purposes and by suggesting that a firm can improve its ego network's value through exerting its network capabilities to shape and adjust network configurations.

Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a qualitative study followed by a scenario-based experimental study. Findings The authors show that recommenders' concern about how they are viewed by recommendation recipients (i.e. their metaperception) mediates the effects of incentives on referral likelihood in both offline and online environments. However, metaperception has a stronger effect offline where recommenders show higher impression management concerns compared to online. Furthermore, tie-strength and communication environment moderate the effect of incentives on metaperception. When referrals are made to weak-ties, incentives decrease metaperception favorability offline more than online. For strong-ties, this effect is lower, and it is similar in offline and online environments. Practical implications The authors recommend managers to design both online and offline RRPs that minimize metaperception concerns; target strong ties in any communication environment as metaperception concerns are low; and target weak ties online where metaperception concerns are muted.

It is becoming more common among consumers, boosted by the internet, which facilitates the collaboration process with both strong and weak ties. This paper aims to examine collaborative consumer experience, delving into the factors that contribute to the adoption and the perceived benefits of this alternative form of consumption. Design/methodology/approach A total of 12 phenomenological interviews were conducted o explore the theme from an individual perspective, attested by the consumers' narratives and experiences. Findings The results highlight collaborative consumption as being influenced by family practices, social relations and the current economic scenario. Also, noteworthy is the evidence that collaborative consumption enables consumers to select from a more diversified portfolio of products and services, especially the ones featured by the internet and social media. Consumers perceive financial, emotional, social, environmental and increased consumption benefits, depending on their practices of collaborative consumption, and also on their role as providers, consumers or exchangers.

A Consideration of Network Content and the Social Ties That Provide It,SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY,"The strength of weak ties is among the most important theories in the social sciences. One paradoxical element of the theory has been widely understood and valued-that weak ties connect disparate regions of social structure. Less appreciated, however, is the arguably more paradoxical implication that someone only weakly connected to another would provide value beyond that which is provided by the recipient's (ego's) strong ties. Once this paradoxical feature of the theory and associated empirical literatures is acknowledged, the interests of the resource provider (alter) demand consideration. To do so faithfully requires first, the concession that different types of content can be transmitted across ties (e.g., financial, informational, physical, social) and content varies in important ways that relate to alter's interests and concerns. This article considers social network content and the strength of ties that provide different forms of it. The case of startups is used as a fruitful strategic research site because of the varied resources required at various stages of the startup process. Novel insights are proposed concerning what content flows across different types of social relationships in the context of ""nascent"" entrepreneurship. Examples from other contexts such as job search are also discussed to exemplify scope. Importantly, this article takes the perspective of the resource provider, alter, and considers her concerns about trust, misuse, and unauthorized transfer in dyadic exchange. In the process, a second paradoxical feature of the theory is identified and theorized, which usefully reveals the boundaries of exchange.",2019"Levin, Daniel Z.; Walter, Jorge",Before They Were Ties: Predicting the Value of Brand-New Connections,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT,"Complementing and extending prior studies on the value of existing work relationships, this study examines whether we can predict the value of brand-new ties before people ever meet. We examine this question by developing three sets of hypotheses reflecting the three main perspectives in the social networks literature: the resource (actor), dyadic (tie), and structural (network) perspective. To test our hypotheses, we asked executives to reach out for advice from someone they had never met and to complete a survey of their various thoughts about the other person both before and after making a connection. We find support for all three perspectives after a connection has been made; however, before tie formation, we find evidence only for the structural perspective. Our results suggest that the lack of reliable information about strangers obscures which brand-new ties will turn out to be more valuable but that surrounding network structures remain a reliable predictor of value, even for brand-new ties.",2019"Wilkinson, Callie","Weak Ties in a Tangled Web? Relationships between the Political Residents of the English East India Company and their munshis, 1798-1818",MODERN ASIAN STUDIES,"Although historians have long recognized the important role that Indians played in the English East India Company's operations, the focus has usually been on the mechanics of direct rule in 'British' India. Yet, the expertise of Indian cultural intermediaries was arguably even more important, as well as more contested, in the context of the Company's growing political influence over nominally independent Indian kingdoms. This article examines the relationships between the East India Company's political representatives (Residents) and their Indian secretaries (munshis) at Indian royal courts during a period of dramatic imperial expansion, from 1798 to 1818. The article considers how these relationships were conceptualized and debated by British officials, and reflects on the practical consequences of these relationships for the munshis involved. The tensions surrounding the role of the munshi in Residency business exemplify some of the practical dilemmas posed by the developing system of indirect rule in India, where the Resident had to decide how much responsibility to delegate to Indian experts better versed in courtly norms and practices, while at the same time maintaining his own image of authority and control. Although the Resident-munshi relationship was in many respects mutually beneficial, these relationships nevertheless spawned anxieties about transparency and accountability within the Company itself, as well as exciting resentments at court. Both Residents and munshis were required to negotiate between two political and institutional cultures, but it was the munshi who seems to have borne the brunt of the risks associated with this intermediary position.",2019"Sawai, Shiho; Bose, Christine E.",Transnational-Migrant Domestic Workers' Cultural Activism Online: The Case of an Indonesian Islamic-Writing Group in Hong Kong,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF JAPANESE SOCIOLOGY,"This study aims to illustrate the nuanced efficacy of Islamic-writing activism by Indonesian domestic workers in Hong Kong, who vigorously utilize online spheres. We regard this group as a part of transnational migrant domestic workers' cultural activism, which is currently flourishing in the region. In particular, we pay a special attention to this group's intersectional themes in Islam and writing, to ask how an intersectional activist group utilizes online terrains and multiple themes, to nurture affective ties with others and simultaneously build activist networks. By combining questionnaires, socio-metric surveys, interviews and web content analysis, we argue that the participation in this activism allows the members collective and personal empowerment online. From the data analyses, we uncover three key features of the members' Facebook usage: maintaining weak ties by balancing multiple group memberships, using tools for interactive self-identification, and being driven by networking. Additionally, the members re-contextualized their gender and class identities in positive ways, using Islam and writing. We argue that the members utilized Islam chiefly as moral yardstick and image-making, while writing as a multitasking tool and an alternative class marker for them.Through these acts of re-contextualization, the members recreate their alternative self-identifications incorporating class, religion, gender and nationality seamlessly. These features partly resonate with their offline behaviors, to assist and synthesize their attempt at self-actualization in-between their cultural spaces, by integrating the host society, native society, and the activist society.","Lane, A.

E.; Stains, M.",Investigating how faculty social networks and peer influence relate to knowledge and use of evidence-based teaching practices,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,"Background Calls for science education reform have been made for decades in the USA. The recent call to produce one million new science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) graduates over 10 years highlights the need to employ evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) in undergraduate STEM classes to create engaging and effective learning environments. EBIPs are teaching strategies that have been empirically demonstrated to positively impact student learning, attitudes, and achievement in STEM disciplines. However, the mechanisms and processes by which faculty learn about and choose to implement EBIPs remain unclear. To explore this problem area, we used social network analysis to examine how an instructor's knowledge and use of EBIPs may be influenced by their peers within a STEM department. We investigated teaching discussion networks in biology and chemistry departments at three public universities. Results We report that tie strength and tie diversity vary between departments, but that mean indegree is not correlated with organizational rank or tenure status. We also describe that teaching discussion ties can often be characterized as strong ties based on two measures of tie strength. Further, we compare peer influence models and find consistent evidence that peer influence in these departments follows a network disturbances model. Conclusions Our findings with respect to tie strength and tie diversity indicate that the social network structures in these departments vary in how conducive they might be to change. The correlation in teaching practice between discussion partner and peer influence models suggest that change agents should consider local social network characteristics when developing change strategies. In particular, change agents can expect that faculty may serve as opinion leaders regardless of their academic rank and that faculty can increase their use of EBIPs even if those they speak to about teaching use EBIPs comparatively less.",2019"Ganguly, Anirban; Talukdar, Asim; Chatterjee, Debdeep","Evaluating the role of social capital, tacit knowledge sharing, knowledge quality and reciprocity in determining innovation capability of an organization",JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,"Purpose Knowledge sharing has become an integral part of organizations' business strategies, along with aiding organizations to grow and innovate in the market, and gain competitive advantage. This paper aims to concentrate on the role of tacit knowledge sharing in fostering innovation capability of an organization. Specifically, the study considers social capital (relational, cognitive and structural) as an important precursors to tacit knowledge sharing, which in turn, influences innovation capability of an organization. The study further discusses the role that knowledge reciprocation plays in successful tacit knowledge sharing. The relation between knowledge quality and innovation capability is also discussed in the paper. Design/methodology/approach The investigation started with a review of extant literature in the field of knowledge sharing and innovation to derive a set of constructs. A set of hypotheses was developed based on the identified constructs, which was subsequently validated through a primary survey based on a structured questionnaire on a sample size of 190 respondents from the Indian industrial domain. The survey responses were subsequently analysed using the statistical technique of structural equation modeling and conclusions were drawn from the findings. Additionally, careful attention was paid in eliminating the common method bias, which is often associated with a primary survey. Findings A set of six hypotheses were derived based on the identified constructs and were subsequently validated. While validating the hypotheses, it was observed that while knowledge reciprocity, relational social capital and cognitive social capital was positive associated with tacit knowledge sharing, structural social capital did not have a significant effect on the same. Additionally, it was also observed that both tacit knowledge sharing and the quality of knowledge were positively associated with innovation capability. Originality/value Although there is a growing body of literature concerning the role of knowledge management in innovation, there still a dearth in discussing the role of tacit knowledge sharing in exploiting the innovation capability of an organization. The main discussion of this paper brings together a set of important constructs that exhibits the significant role that tacit knowledge sharing plays in determining the innovation capability of an organization. Furthermore, it tries to marry the concepts of social capital and tacit knowledge sharing with innovation capability, therefore adding significantly to the body of literature in knowledge management as well as innovation.",2019"Anand, Amitabh; Walsh, Isabelle; Moffett, Sandra",Does humility facilitate knowledge sharing? Investigating the role of humble knowledge inquiry and response,JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,"Purpose Despite the strong focus on virtues in firms, humility is little recognized in the management literature and, more particularly in the literature about knowledge sharing (KS). Despite efforts to foster KS among employees in firms, the effectiveness of this process narrows down to the dyadic relationship between the knowledge seeker and provider within firm. This paper aims to investigate the role of humility in the KS process in dyadic activity. Design/methodology/approach The authors undertake an exploratory investigation to fill some of the gaps found in the literature. The paper draws insights from psychology, history, religion, current events and management literature. Findings The authors identify several individual propensities that help predict humility towards sharing knowledge from seeker (humble knowledge-inquiry) and provider perspectives (humble response). They propose a new conceptual process model of KS with humility as an important variable to consider. This work highlights several promising directions for future research. Originality/value As per the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates the role of humility in knowledge sharing from dyadic perspective.

However, a further exploration of the reasons behind the weak-ties phenomenon is still challenging. Fortunately, data-driven network science provides a novel way with substantial explanatory power to analyze the causal mechanism behind social phenomena. Inspired by this perspective, we propose an approach to further explore the driving factors behind the temporal weak-ties phenomenon. We find that the obvious intuition underlying the weak-ties phenomenon is incorrect, and often large numbers of unknown mutual friends associated with these weak ties is one of the key reasons for the emergence of the weak-ties phenomenon. In particular, scientific collaborators with weak ties prefer to be involved in direct collaboration rather than share ideas with mutual colleagues - there is a natural tendency to collapse short strong chains of connection.

As a social resource, a social network can provide people with social support and help job seekers find better jobs by transmitting the information on job opportunities. However, currently, there are few empirical studies on employment quality from the perspective of social networks. Based on data from 194 samples from 400 households in Sichuan Province in 2015, this paper constructs an employment quality index system from the six dimensions of labor wages, working time, employment stability, employment environment, career development, and social security. In addition, from the perspective of the structural features and the overall characteristics of the social network, OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) and the path analysis model are used to quantitatively explore the mechanisms of action paths of the social network in terms of the non-agricultural employment quality of part-time peasants. The results show that: (1) the social network scale and the relative network of part-time peasants are found to positively affect employment quality. (2) Age, gender, and education level have indirect impacts on the employment quality loop through network heterogeneity and network scale. In addition, network heterogeneity and health status indirectly impact employment quality through a network scale. (3) By synthesizing the direct and indirect impacts, the comprehensive impacts of each factor on employment quality, in decreasing order, are: village-county distance > village terrain > family population > network scale > education level > skill > network heterogeneity > health status > age > gender. The results suggest that we should pay attention to the role of social network resources in improving employment quality, and should implement various measures to expand peasants' social networks, so as to achieve high-quality employment.",2019"Parker, Andrew; Tippmann, Esther; Kratochvi, Renate",Accessing diverse knowledge for problem solving in the MNC: A network mobilization perspective,GLOBAL STRATEGY JOURNAL,"Research Summary: The fundamental challenge of problem solving is synthesizing diverse knowledge for solution development. This article addresses the trade-off between knowledge diversity, that is, approaching the most relevant individual to maximize the likelihood that he/she possesses diverse knowledge and the ability to access, that is, recognize and assimilate this knowledge. We examine this trade-off in relation to managers in subsidiaries of multinational corporations (MNCs) and two types of diverse knowledge-novel knowledge and specialist expertise. We use a network mobilization perspective and arguments on network range within and across organizational boundaries, testing our hypotheses on a dataset of 838 ties from 120 managers leading problem-solving projects. Our study offers implications for the knowledge-based view of the MNC as well as the problem-solving perspective in strategy. Managerial Summary: We examine where managers in subsidiaries of multinational corporations (MNCs) access diverse knowledge to solve nonroutine problems. This is underpinned by a trade-off. To increase chances that the other person holds diverse knowledge, they may reach far in terms of approaching an individual in a different work context; but such far reach diminishes their ability to integrate this knowledge. We resolve this trade-off. We find that approaching individuals from an MNC unit in another country location but from the same function increases the likelihood of accessing novel knowledge; whereas accessing specialist expertise is more likely achieved by approaching an MNC colleague from another function located in another country and someone working for an external organization. Overall, we provide insights for problem solvers in organizations.",2019"Wu, Yan; Wall, Matthew",The ties that bind: How the dominance of WeChat combines with guanxi to inhibit and constrain China's contentious politics,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,"Despite the market dominance of WeChat in contemporary China, we currently know little about its significance for Chinese politics. WeChat enables strong-tie communicative networks, which prior research indicates is consequential for contentious political engagement. Drawing on evidence from focus groups conducted with Chinese citizens in the United Kingdom, we reveal that although WeChat users are often connected through offline social and professional networks, contentious politics manifests on the app only under a narrow range of circumstances. Furthermore, political contention on WeChat is reported by our respondents to be largely confined to matters of 'interest-oriented' and/or 'safe' topics that do not challenge the wider political system. This trend is driven by a combination of political and cultural dynamics which we elaborate in a theoretically informed thematic analysis, arguing that engaging with the concept of guanxi provides more insight into the political repercussions of WeChat in China than a focus on tie strength.",2019"Miller, Stewart R.; Mors, Marie Louise; McDonald, Michael",Expectations for Help Within and Across the Formal Boundaries of Executives' Professional Advice Networks,MANAGEMENT INTERNATIONAL REVIEW,"We develop a theoretical framework for executives' expectations for receiving help from professional contacts in their advice networks across national (local/nonlocal) and organizational (inside/outside) boundaries. Moreover, we examine the effects of relational duration and trust in the relationships. In a study using unique data on 1807 professional relationships in a US-headquartered multinational consulting firm, we find that executives expect less help from outside contacts. This result is partially mediated by trust. Also, relational duration mitigates expectations for help from outsiders. Surprisingly, we find no evidence that executives expect less help from nonlocal contacts. Yet a test of nonlocal professional contacts reveals that geographic distance rather than cultural distance, affects the expectations for help.

Methods Drawing upon a data set from the Chinese General Social Survey, this article first uses clustered effect logit models and then adopts a propensity score matching (PSM) model for a robustness check. Results The results demonstrate that citizens who have access to more advanced transportation modes and spend less time on traveling are more likely to establish weak ties, especially with nonagricultural citizens in prestigious job positions. The results also indicate that strong family ties are not the consequence of mobility. By disaggregating the full sample, this article further reveals that the young, rich, and female citizens reap more benefit from mobility.

Key findings show that their negative perceptions of mobile Internet fraud vary significantly by the strength of their social relationships and network homogeneity the closer the ties, the greater perceived vulnerability to mobile Internet fraud; the more homogenous their social networks, the more pronounced the pattern. In addition, awareness of the fraud was found to enhance the self-other perceptual gap.

However, little research has been conducted to understand what motivates health-care providers to participate in such communities. This study utilizes the expectancy/value theory to identify the factors that might affect health professionals' intentions to continue contributing health knowledge in online health communities (OHCs). Specific motivators driving health professionals' continuance intentions in OHCs include intrinsic motivators (helping motivator, self-efficacy, and moral obligation), and extrinsic motivators (reputation). This study also investigates how health professionals' satisfaction in the OHC mediates the relationship between the study motivators and the continuance intentions. The study also suggests that health professional characteristics have a moderating effect on continuance intentions. The study employed a sample of 234 health professionals who contribute to a well-regarded OHC in Jordan to test the theoretical model developed for this study. The findings suggest that helping motivator, self-efficacy motivator, and reputation motivator affect OHC members' satisfaction. The helping motivator, reputation motivator, moral obligation motivator, and satisfaction affect OHC members' contribution continuance intentions. Finally, the study finds that age, work experience, experience in the OHC, and the daily time spent in the OHC, moderate the relationship between the helping motivator and continuance intentions.","Lee, Juheon",Bonding and bridging social capital and their associations with self-evaluated community resilience: A comparative study of East Asia,JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY & APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,"The purpose of this study is to test key social capital indicators in a disaster context by considering the bonding and bridging types of social capital. Using the East Asian Social Survey, this study chooses three behavioural/cognitive elements of social capital-social trust, voluntary association membership, and personal networks-and divides them into bonding and bridging social capital, in-group and out-group trust, homogeneous and heterogeneous membership, and strong and weak ties to test their effects on self-evaluated community resilience to natural hazards. The results showed that social trust and personal networks had strong positive effects, but the effect of voluntary association membership was positive in societies with high rates of membership (Japan and South Korea) and negative in a society with a low rate of membership (Taiwan). Furthermore, while bonding social capital generally showed a stronger effect than bridging social capital in East Asia, a society with more frequent and intense disasters (Japan) showed a strong effect of heterogenous membership on self-evaluated community resilience. This study connects two aspects of social capital studies-the elements and the types of social capital-and the findings imply that the relationship between social capital and community resilience may have some mediator variables.","Ouakouak, Mohammed Laid; Ouedraogo, Noufou",Fostering knowledge sharing and knowledge utilization The impact of organizational commitment and trust,BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the influence of organizational commitment and trust on knowledge sharing and on knowledge utilization.

In more detail, the aim of the paper is to analyse how a start-up becomes embedded through its networking behaviours in a business network. To approach this phenomenon, the theoretical frame of reference is based on the industrial network approach to industrial markets separating developing, producing and using settings. The business network settings are combined with networking behaviours consisting of both strong and weak ties. Importantly, for a start-up to become embedded through networking, resources of the start-up need to be combined with resources in the three business network settings. The paper relies on a case study methodology focusing on a start-up, founded at a technical university in Sweden, and its networking behaviours. The paper concludes that networking behaviours relying on strong ties are crucial to resource combining. However, the analysis also shows the importance of networking behaviours of weak ties, acquiring information and interaction to sensing new opportunities. The paper ends with managerial implications for start-up managers, pinpointing the need to work with both strong and weak ties as a platform to eventually become embedded in business networks.",2019"Gonzalez, Carlos",Transnational board interlocks The influence of degree of internationalization and psychic distance,CROSS CULTURAL & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT,"Purpose While previous studies have focused on the role of directors in the formation of transnational interlocks, this paper argues that firm strategy can also influence the development of these relationships. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the practice of transnational interlocks by extending board interlocks theory from the national to the transnational context, and exploring aspects that are unique to the transnational level. Design/methodology/approach Based on the experiences of four British firms, this paper develops a conceptual framework that integrates under-examined dimensions of this networking practice at the organizational level of analysis, specifically degree of internationalization (DOI) and psychic distance (PD). Findings The paper argues that firms will increasingly engage in transnational interlocks as internationalization intensifies, and that expansion into psychically distant countries may result in further engagement in these connections. Further, firms will tend to form transnational received interlocks at their early stages of internationalization, and transnational sent and neutral interlocks at later stages of this process. It identifies four categories of firms: locals, extenders, explorers and cosmopolitans. Originality/value The manuscript contributes to our understanding of transnational interlocks by examining the independent and joint influence of the firm's DOI and PD on the formation of such relationships.",2019"Rishika, Rishika; Ramaprasad, Jui","The Effects of Asymmetric Social Ties, Structural Embeddedness, and Tie Strength on Online Content Contribution Behavior",MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"For a social media community to thrive and grow, it is critical that users of the site interact with each other and contribute content to the site. We study the role of social ties in motivating user preference expression, a form of user content contribution, in an online social media community. We examine the role of three types of ties, reciprocated, follower, and followee ties, and assess whether the structural and relational properties of a user's social network moderate the social influence effect in user contribution. A unique disaggregate level panel data set of users' contributions and social tie formation activities from an online music platform is employed to study the impact of social ties. To address identification issues, we adopt a quasi-experimental approach based on dynamic propensity score matching. The results provide strong evidence of the influence of online network ties in online contribution behavior. We find that the influence of reciprocated ties is the greatest, followed by influence from followee ties and then follower ties. Additional analysis reveals that reciprocated and followee ties have even greater influence when they contribute new information for a focal user. Structural embeddedness and tie strength among network ties are found to amplify the effect of social contagion in online contribution. We conduct several sensitivity and robustness checks that lend credible support to our findings. The results add to the greater understanding of social influence in online contribution and provide valuable managerial insights into designs of online communities to enable greater user participation.",2019"Alidoust, Sara; Bosman, Caryl; Holden, Gordon",Planning for healthy ageing: how the use of third places contributes to the social health of older populations,AGEING & SOCIETY,"In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on creating age-friendly cities to accommodate the changing needs of older people and to promote their overall health and wellbeing. This paper focuses on some of the urban planning implications related to maintaining the social health, as a main component of overall health and wellbeing, of older people. Specifically, we look at the role and accessibility of third places (popular public places where many people go to socialise) in relation to older people living in different neighbourhood built-form patterns, and how these factors impact on the formation of absent, weak and strong social ties. The data draw upon interviews with 54 older people living in different neighbourhood built-form patterns on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. Our findings demonstrate the significant role third places have in affording older people opportunities to engage in the social lives of their local communities, thus contributing to their social health and overall wellbeing. This research supports previous studies relating to the accessibility of amenities by re-emphasising the importance of planning for the provision of third places that are conveniently located and easily accessible by older people. The paper concludes by arguing for the planning of transport and third-place interventions in Australia's sprawling suburban landscapes to allow older people more opportunities to be socially connected.",2019"Hahmann, Julia",The spatial dimensions of supported communitization. An American case example,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GERONTOLOGIE UND GERIATRIE,"Background. Weak relationships result in feelings of belonging to a social neighborhood, as can be found in retirement communities. Objective. This article analyzes spatial arrangements and the registered rules for furnishings with respect to their potential to facilitate communitization processes and explain their modes of action as potential third places. Material and methods. The study took place in an American Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC). The analysis combined biographical narrations with inhabitants, interview material with staff as well as field notes. Results. The interviewed persons predominantly talked about the dining hall regarding their first steps in the community of the CCRC. The community table, situated in the dining hall, is equipped with rules to ensure participation in communitization processes. The rules are monitored by acommittee of volunteers and staff members. The professionally supported processes result in feelings of belonging. Deviant behavior, e.g. refusing participation, results in an increased effort of staff to support communitization. Discussion. Spatial structures create places for interaction, positively influence communitization and in their representation are reminiscent of third places in natural neighborhoods; however, due to class barriers and rules they cannot be described as third places.",2019"Thornton, Sabrina C.; Henneberg, Stephan C.; Leischnig, Alexander; Naude, Peter",It's in the Mix: How Firms Configure Resource Mobilization for New Product Success,JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT,"This paper aims to deepen the understanding about when and how the mobilization of resources through strong and weak ties in a focal firm's network can affect new product success. It addresses two significant gaps in the literature. While prior research has advanced the understanding of how factors around tie strength, resource mobilization, and environmental characteristics relate to new product development, it has yet to offer a more holistic understanding of the interconnected structures and the interplay among these factors. Furthermore, limited insights exist about how firms could utilize resource mobilization approaches in different environmental contexts to enhance new product success. Building on resource dependence theory, this paper contributes to prior work by adopting configuration theoretical considerations and performing an empirical investigation to identify necessary and sufficient conditions for new product success. Based on data from a survey of 354 managers from manufacturing and services firms in the United Kingdom, the study conducts a configurational comparative study based on fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to examine configurations of strong-tie and weak-tie resource mobilization approaches within particular environmental contexts for new product success. The findings reveal alternative, equifinal configurations for new product success, and add to the existing body of work by connecting the notions of network ties, resource mobilization, and context dependence, as well as by developing an integrative framework to explain the interplay of remote and proximate conditions for new product success. For management practice, this study offers guidance in describing and diagnosing business contexts that enhance new product success, and in identifying resource mobilization action repertoires to capitalize on these contexts.",2019"Mehreen, Aqsa; Hui, Yang; Ali, Zulqurnain",A social network theory perspective on how social ties influence perceived employability and job insecurity: evidence from school teachers,SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING,"With the emergence of critical educational reforms and agentic career perspective, unemployment and job insecurity are considered a significant threat to school teachers in Pakistan. Drawing on the social network theory (SNT), this study attempts to investigate the effect of social network ties on perceived employability (PEM) and job insecurity (JIS) and how PEM mediates the association between social ties and job insecurity. Moreover, the current study pursues to assess the moderation effect of information sharing in the association between social network ties and PEM. Using the survey approach, we recruited teachers from government schools. The proposed model and relationships were validated through structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear regression. The findings revealed that strong tie is significantly related to PEM and JIS. Similarly, the weak tie is significantly related to PEM except for JIS. This study extends SNT by empirically establishing the influence of network characteristics (strong and weak ties) on PEM and JIS. This study helps school management and government policymakers to enhance teacher's PEM and job security through networking and training opportunities. This research moreover guides government policymakers to formulate realistic education policies with the consensuses of school management. This practice will enhance teachers' trust toward acceptance and implementation of educational policies. The present research successfully covers the gap by establishing the association of social network ties with PEM and JIS which was largely ignored in the literature on social employment management.",2019"Piercy, Cameron W.; Lee, Sun Kyong",A typology of job search sources: Exploring the changing nature of job search networks,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,"This study explored American job seekers' network of information sources using a random sample.

Although online sources were particularly central in the network, job seekers who used one source type did so at the expense of other types of sources. Older and poorer job seekers were more likely to use formal sources, while online sources were used more by job seekers with higher education and Internet efficacy. The discussion offers advice for job seekers and those who coach job search.

By using an analytical frame derived from the literature and consisting of key antecedents of social networks, we find differences between the conventional assumptions of social network characteristics when comparing them with those found in East Asia. Moreover, we find remarkable intra-regional differences. Among these, and contrary to common beliefs about social networks, we find weak ties are neither hardly effective nor preferably used in East Asia, where strong ties are both more preferred and more powerful. Further, social ties tend to be rather consummatory and networks rather closed. Also, depending on the nature of the network, bridging either does not work or is not intended. We recommend further studies explicitly taking local context into account in order to refine or reframe extant knowledge on social networks.",2019"Fukuzawa, Ai; Katagiri, Keiko; Harada, Kazuhiro; Masumoto, Kouhei; Chogahara, Makoto; Kondo, Narihiko; Okada, Shuichi",A longitudinal study of the moderating effects of social capital on the relationships between changes in human capital and ikigai among Japanese older adults,ASIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,"Ikigai, one of the indices of well-being, tends to decline with age because resources relating to ikigai decline. However, there are individual differences in this decline. This study tested for maintenance of ikigai among Japanese elderly, using a longitudinal study investigating the moderating role of social capital on the effects of changes in human capital on ikigai. We conducted a panel survey targeting 1,068 people (M age = 73.01 years) in 2013, and 686 people in 2017. The variables were ikigai, changes in human capital (self-rated financial status, physical health) and social capital (social networks, trust in others), educational level, and control variables. Multiple regression analyses revealed the interaction effects of changes in physical health and changes in social networks (strong ties, weak ties) on follow-up ikigai. Post hoc analyses indicated that declines in physical health predicted declines in ikigai among those whose social networks (strong ties and weak ties) had declined in the 4-year study, but these relationships were not significant among those whose social networks had increased. The results suggest that older adults can weaken the adverse effect of a decline in human capital on ikigai by maintaining or increasing social networks.",2019"Rowland, Lee; Curry, Oliver Scott",A range of kindness activities boost happiness,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,"This experiment investigates the effects of a seven-day kindness activities intervention on changes in subjective happiness. The study was designed to test whether performing different types of kindness activities had differential effects on happiness. Our recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the psychological effects of kindness (Curry, et al. 2018) revealed that performing acts of kindness boosts happiness and well-being. However, we noted in that review that rarely had researchers specifically compared the effects of kindness to different recipients, such as to friends or to strangers. Thus in a single factorial design (n=683) we compare acts of kindness to strong social ties, weak social ties, novel acts of self kindness, and observing acts of kindness, against a no acts control group. The results indicate that performing kindness activities for seven days increases happiness. In addition, we report a positive correlation between the number of kind acts and increases in happiness. Neither effect differed across the experimental the groups, suggesting that kindness to strong ties, to weak ties, and to self, as well as observing acts of kindness, have equally positive effects on happiness.",2019"Skigin, Natan","Spreading Influence Through Weak Ties: Cosponsorship, Legislative Networks, and Bill Success in Fragmented Congresses",LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY,"Literature on legislative success tends to focus on independent variables of which lawmakers have scarce control. This article analyzes instead how legislators' strategies affect their success in Congress. I posit that while weak ties between congresspeople are the most useful in increasing success in the chamber of origin under majoritarian settings, they do not raise the likelihood of bill approval in the second chamber or in plurality-led legislatures. Building on a data set that contains all bills proposed to the Argentine Congress between 1983 and 2007, results support these context-dependence hypotheses. I then use data from the Uruguayan Congress (1995-2010) to explore how the argument plays out in a Latin American legislature with weaker gatekeeping rules (i.e., an ""open sky"" legislature).

These co-variations between socioecological factors, individual behavior, and group-level structure are important to study since ecological factors may strongly influence animal health outcomes and reproductive success. Besides factors such as social information and/or infectious agents, with far-reaching individual fitness consequences, seem independent of individuals' own social interactions but directly affected by the topology of the social network. This paper reviews how socio-ecological pressures, i.e., causal factors (food distribution, predation, and infectious agent risk), via intermediary mechanisms (stress, information sharing, and mating system), may affect individual social behavior and consequently, social network topology. We also discuss how evolutionary driving forces, genetic (i.e., genes) and cultural (i.e., learned behavior) selection, may result in a specific composition of individuals' social strategies that produce network topologies that might be optimized to specific socio-ecological conditions. We conclude that studies focusing on whether and how well networks resist changing conditions might provide a better understanding of the rules underlying individual behavior, which in turn influences network topologya process we have called network evolution. Evolutionary processes may favor a group phenotypic composition, thus a network topology.

However, the owner-manager's own resilience has been largely overlooked in the small firm resilience literature. The purpose of this paper is to redress this and expand the debate and empirical basis of small firm owner-managers' personal resources for resilience. Design/methodology/approach This longitudinal qualitative study deployed semi-structured interviews with nine owner-managers, each being interviewed three or four times. Analytical procedures were used with an established framework, which conceptualised four key personal resources for resilience, as follows: adaptability, confidence, social support and purposefulness. Findings There were four key findings, as follows: owner-manager adaptability can appear in extremes including a sense of helplessness or optimism where disruptive circumstances are not sensed as problematic; owner-manager confidence levels often echo their own mindset of adaptability, that is, from helplessness to positive ambition; owner-managers can use discursive tactics with strong/weak ties for a range of affective and technical resources for resilience; and purposefulness tended to be framed in terms of a necessity for a longer term future state related to own or family lifestyle rather than profit. It is also noted that the owner-manager and the firm are closely interrelated, and therefore, enhancement of personal resilience resources is likely to positively influence their resilience, and therefore, the resilience of the organisation and strategic capability of the firm. Originality/value The small firm resilience literature typically focusses on the organisational level, which de-emphasises the salient role of the owner-manager and their resilience. This study attempts to redress this.",2019"Boas, Ingrid",Social networking in a digital and mobile world: the case of environmentally-related migration in Bangladesh,JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES,"This paper interrogates how the social networks and the networking of migrants, and through that their migration trajectories, are being shaped by mobile technologies. I examine this through the case of environmentally-related migration in Bangladesh. This case, and the issue of environmentally-related migration more generally, provides new insights as it has a different context to most of the cases thus far examined to study the implications of ICTs on migration. In contrast to those studies, it is about internal movement. Such movement is highly dynamic with people frequently visiting places of origin or even trying to move back, and with travel routes being relatively safe and well known. It is less about smart phones and social media, as many of the most affected only have access to a mobile phone without internet. In that context, this paper shows that the use of mobile technologies does not necessarily lead to a drastic shift of social network structure towards the proliferation of weak ties. Rather, in this case, the impact is on how (often existing) ties that are geographically dispersed are utilised to enable mobility in a more coordinated manner, making mobility decisions more reflected on and to an extent less risky.","Verdasco, Andrea",Everyday Rituals of Migration: Constructing Relatedness and Agency among Young Refugees in Denmark,ETHNOS,"This article examines how young unaccompanied refugees living together within the confines of an asylum centre in Denmark construct different kinds of social relations and the meanings attached to these relationships. By investigating their routinised practices of everyday life as 'rituals', I analyse how young refugees negotiate different kinds of relatedness that enable them to exert agency. The ethnography points to the progression and expansion of different modes of relatedness to include friendships as well as consociate relationships, both with peers with whom they create a sense of community, and with adults who help them navigate the asylum landscape. The study underscores the deeply social nature of the young refugees' agency. I argue that in the intensity of living together they transform weak ties into strong ties, described through idioms of friendship and kinship, that express the profound meaning of these relationships in the context of the uncertainty they face.","Sklyar, Alexey; Kowalkowski, Christian; Sorhammar, David; Tronvoll, Bard",Resource integration through digitalisation: a service ecosystem perspective,JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT,"As digitalisation increasingly encompasses entire service ecosystems, it modifies resource integration patterns that connect ecosystem actors through strong and weak ties. To clarify how technological development contributes to this change, and how resource integration transforms the service ecosystem, this qualitative case study explores the digitalisation strategy of a market-leading systems integrator in the maritime industry. Based on 40 depth interviews with managers, the findings show how technology increasingly serves as a key operant resource in the transformation of resource integration patterns. The study contributes to ecosystem dynamics research by identifying major differences between the pre-digitalised and digitalised states of a service ecosystem, and demonstrates the dual role of technology in both increasing pattern complexity and facilitating coordination of that complexity.",2019"Pan, Xi; Chee, Kyong Hee",The power of weak ties in preserving cognitive function: a longitudinal study of older Chinese adults,AGING & MENTAL HEALTH,"Objectives: Characterized by infrequent contact, low emotional intensity, and limited intimacy, weak ties are found to be associated with better subjective well-being and other health outcomes. Drawing on the theory of weak ties and the convoy model of social relations, this paper aims to examine the association between weak ties and cognitive function among older adults in China. Methods: We used multilevel growth modeling to analyze panel data for adults aged 60 years and over (N = 2,650) selected from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2011-2015). Weak ties were measured based on the frequency of social activity participation and the number of social activities. Results: Weekly or irregular social activity participation in at least one social activity was significantly associated with better mental status and memory. The number of participated social activities was also significantly and positively associated with mental status and memory. After controlling for age, gender, marital status, educational attainment, geographic residence, household expenditures, and health conditions (i.e., depressive symptoms and self-reported health), we found that participation in a greater number of social activities protected memory from declining by 4% for every 2 years (p < 0.001). Conclusion: These findings suggest that social interactions with peripheral members of a diverse social network may help prevent cognitive decline for older Chinese adults. Greater attention on weak ties might yield practical implications for non-pharmacological dementia prevention and health promotion for the general older population.","Alianmoghaddam, Narges; Phibbs, Suzanne; Benn, Cheryl",I did a lot of Googling: A qualitative study of exclusive breastfeeding support through social media,WOMEN AND BIRTH,"Background: Little qualitative research has been done to explore the quality of breastfeeding support through social media in New Zealand. Aim: This article aims to explore the influence of social media on exclusive breastfeeding practice. Methods: A qualitative study involving face-to-face postpartum interviews with 30 mothers who were recruited from the lower North Island of New Zealand. Each participant was followed via short monthly audio-recorded telephone interviews until giving up exclusive breastfeeding or until six months after the birth. The theories "" strength of weak ties"" and "" landscapes of care"" are applied to the thematic analysis of the interview material to illuminate the influence of social media on breastfeeding practices. Results: Qualitative analysis of the interview material identified four themes: 1) Mothers need reliable online infant feeding information; 2) Smartphone apps can be a good option for promoting breastfeeding; 3) Information is accessed through weak ties among breastfeeding mothers on Facebook, and 4) the utility of geographically distant infant feeding support via Skype. Discussion: Most participants sourced post-partum information and advice to support breastfeeding through the Internet, while those with geographically distant family members accessed emotional and practical breastfeeding support via Skype. Implications for Practice: Breastfeeding advocates should use social media to promote and support exclusive breast-feeding practice. Conclusion: The influence of social media on breastfeeding points to the relational nature of breastfeeding which is embedded in ` real' world and virtual social networks as well as the cultural, geographic and social contexts of a mother's life.

Strong and weak ties influence the entrepreneurial process in unique ways. This study utilized social network analysis approach to examine wildlife tourism microentrepreneurship through in-person structured interviews with 37 microentrepreneurs from North Carolina's Pamlico Sound Region. Specifically, this study examined the extent of network ties, the type of support received from those network ties, and the process of creating and maintaining the business network ties. Weak ties were more prevalent than strong ties. Support was received in terms of marketing and advertising, information sharing, and product sponsorship. Weak ties were established through professional workshops and seminars or while working in the same territory, whereas reciprocity, togetherness, communication, and trust were identified as major factors to maintain weak ties.

The primary focus of studies investigating coopetition centers on inter-firm relationships, highlighting the benefits, limits and configurational patterns of cooperative relationships between competing firms. Only a small, emerging group of studies seeks to extend the concept to the intra-firm level, stressing the existence and effects of competition and cooperation between units that are part of the same organization. This paper contributes to this latter group by investigating the effects of internal coopetition on knowledge and innovation sharing and highlighting the fundamental role of knowledge brokers in managing the resulting tensions. Based on a qualitative case study of the video game publisher Ubisoft, we stress how the tensions raised by internal coopetitive settings limit knowledge sharing between units, and we analyze the mechanisms through which the knowledge broker helps to overcome these limits. We identify three main functions of this knowledge broker that allow the promotion of knowledge and innovation transfer to occur between coopeting units: (1) protecting the unit's competitive advantage by introducing a lagging principle in the transfer process, (2) reducing sharing costs by standardizing innovative solutions, and (3) enhancing awareness of and trust in innovative solutions by centralizing knowledge diffusion.",2019"Lopaciuk-Gonczaryk, Beata",Does Participation in Social Networks Foster Trust and Respect for Other People-Evidence from Poland,SUSTAINABILITY,"A shortage of social capital may hinder sustainable development. According to the ""social capital dream"" there is a virtuous circle between participation in social networks, trust, and cooperation. It is a promising idea for proponents of sustainability, as it is easier to promote participation than affect social norms. Participation may, however, lead to particularized and not generalized trust, which hinders social inclusion and undermines the idea of a sustainable society. The aim of this paper is to validate the role of participation in informal and formal social networks in enhancing social trust and respect towards others. The relevance of both strong and weak ties is considered. Fixed-effects modeling on three-wave data from a Polish social survey is utilized. An increase in generalized trust corresponds with an increase in the acquaintances network, a decrease in the family and friends network, and an increase in volunteering. A rise in expectations about the cooperativeness of others is enhanced by an increase in the family and friends network, and by volunteering. The lack of respect for some groups of people is not affected by participation in organizations and informal networks. Overall within-person heterogeneity is small, suggesting that possibilities for fostering moral trust by participation are limited.",2019"Zhu, Huasheng; Chen, Yawei; Chen, Kebi",Vitalizing Rural Communities: China's Rural Entrepreneurial Activities from Perspective of Mixed Embeddedness,SUSTAINABILITY,"Rural entrepreneurial activities play an important role in the development of rural economies and the vitality of rural areas, and they can also contribute to an increase in the employment opportunities of farmers and environmental sustainability during China's transitional period. As a local organization, the community connects individuals, collective agencies, local authorities, and the market in reforming rural economies in China. Based on the concepts of mixed embeddedness and on the database of the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), this paper uses a binary logistic regression (BLR) model to analyze the impact of social, institutional, and economic environments of rural communities on entrepreneurship. The finding shows that informal, entrepreneurship-oriented institutions in rural communities have more significantly positive impact on farmer entrepreneurship than formal institutions, as well as economic and social environments. Furthermore, compared with kinship, neighborhood relationships and weak ties based on the population mobility in rural communities are more important for farmer entrepreneurship. Additionally, rural communities are the production places and markets, and their economic levels are positively related to entrepreneurship. Last but not least, compared with urban communities, rural communities play a much more prominent role in local entrepreneurship.",2019"Utz, Sonja; Breuer, Johannes","The Relationship Between Networking, LinkedIn Use, and Retrieving Informational Benefits",CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING,"Previous research has shown that users of social network sites designed for professional purposes, such as LinkedIn, report higher professional informational benefits than nonusers. However, this effect could only be partly explained by social media use as there was also a selection effect, such that people who have more informational benefits were more likely to use LinkedIn. The goal of this study was to explore whether differences in networking, defined as a set of behaviors with the aim of building, maintaining, and using internal and external contacts for instrumental purposes, can explain this selection effect. We used data from a panel study with a representative sample of Dutch Internet users (n = 685; 259 LinkedIn users) to examine the relationships between networking and LinkedIn use as well as professional informational benefits, that is, timely access to relevant information. The results showed that people scoring high on external networking (but not internal networking within their organization) are also more likely to use LinkedIn. External networking was also positively correlated with active and passive use as well as the number of strong and latent ties on LinkedIn. However, in a mediation model the direct effect of networking on informational benefits was not mediated by actual social media use and network composition; instead, the number of weak ties had a direct effect on informational benefits. The results thus indicate that networking is a major driver of informational benefits from LinkedIn use.",2019"Fong, Kelley",Subject to Evaluation: How Parents Assess and Mobilize Information from Social Networks in School Choice,SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,"A rich literature examines how information spreads through social networks to influence life opportunities. However, receiving information does not guarantee its use in decision making. This article analyzes information evaluation as a fundamental component of social network mobilization. The case of school choice, where the value of information may be more uncertain, brings this evaluative dimension to the forefront. Interviews with 55 parents in Boston show how parents selecting schools assess their social network ties as information sources, privileging information from those they perceive to have affinity and authority.

It expands understanding of when and why using social network sites (SNSs) provides people with several types of supportive communication by integrating users' social capital and preference for weak tie support. Prior research is synthesized and extended to build a heuristic model of social ties and supportive communication in SNSs that considers network-based variables (i.e., social capital, preference for weak ties) as mechanisms that link the use of SNSs to the supportive messages people receive. A community sample (N = 553) completed an online questionnaire. Results indicated that intensity of Facebook use corresponds with both social capital and received support. Moreover, social capital mediates and preference for weak ties moderates the relationship between using Facebook and receiving support, and results differ according to the types of social capital and support under consideration. Facebook use, for example, only corresponds with receiving informational and esteem support when users exhibit sufficient preferences for weak tie support.",2019"Kim, MiRan; Cichy, Ronald F.; Zhang, Lu; Yu, JungHee",Antecedents of social capital and its impact on satisfaction and Loyalty,JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MARKETING & MANAGEMENT,"This study explores how private club members' involvement with a club's events/activities and online communities, influence club members' bonding and bridging social capital, satisfaction, and loyalty to the club.

However, there is little empirical evidence in faculty hiring patterns within the community. Analyzing hand-curated data of 81 junior and 485 senior faculty members from 27 iSchools in the United States and a total of 41981 journal and conference proceeding publications, we investigate the effects of collaboration experience on placement quality, controlling for other well studied factors including gender, scholarly performance, and prestige of degree-granting programs. In particular, we find that strong ties in collaboration, as measured by PhD advisors' academic achievements, have little correlation with placement quality fixing other factors. On the other hand, weak ties, manifested by coauthors excluding advisors, are found to be beneficial. Providing a better understanding of hiring practice in iSchools, the results highlight the importance of ""standing on the shoulders of giants"" for junior information science researchers wishing to find high-quality faculty job. Finally, our findings lay the foundation for future investigations, where stakeholders and administrators can assess the effectiveness of existing hiring strategies, which in turn provide managerial and policy implications for iSchools to adapt to the fast growing landscape of information science.

Here, we study how external events are associated with a network's change in structure and communications. Analyzing a complete dataset of millions of instant messages among the decision-makers with different roles in a large hedge fund and their network of outside contacts, we investigate the link between price shocks, network structure, and change in the affect and cognition of decision-makers embedded in the network. We also analyze the communication dynamics among specialized teams in the organization. When price shocks occur the communication network tends not to display structural changes associated with adaptiveness such as the activation of weak ties to obtain novel information. Rather, the network ""turtles up."" It displays a propensity for higher clustering, strong tie interaction, and an intensification of insider vs. outsider and within-role vs. between-role communication.

This analysis yielded several interesting findings. First, ECTs formed moderately larger and more diverse groups of close colleagues over time. While organizational structure remained an important influence on ECT social network ties, ECTs exerted greater agency with experience as they began to seek resources outside their grade-level peer group. Second, ECTs used an increasingly diverse set of weak ties to secure resources for challenges they faced that extended beyond instructional matters (e.g., behavior, meeting diverse student needs). Third, while social networks became larger and more diverse, expansion and diversity had limits.

Yet, little research has studied the sub-groups of lawmakers who serve as policy leaders on particular bills. This article uses conceptual and methodological tools from social network analysis to investigate the groups' composition and relational structure. It tests the proposition that limited human resources lead lawmakers from small parties to more frequently engage with a greater number of colleagues from other parties across a wider range of policy areas. This may have important relational benefits that have the potential to outweigh the structural disadvantages of small party size. The article examines whether small party lawmakers participate more, are more central and have greater potential for brokerage in policy-making networks, or if the constraints associated with small party size and/or particular ideological leanings prevent their realisation. Empirically, the analyses focus on working relationships between rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs in the adoption of reports by standing committees of the 7(th) European Parliament, 2009-2014. Methodologically, a mixed methods approach is employed. The quantitative analyses show that small party size does not affect legislators' participation in policy-making networks, but that it increases legislators' centrality and brokerage potential. Regarding ideology, being committed to democratic participation as a good in itself has a positive association with all three outcomes, while attitudes to European integration show no effect. The qualitative data suggest that the relational benefits of belonging to a small party partially mitigate the structural disadvantages associated with it. They also indicate that policy making in the European Parliament is quite inclusive, as any systematic exclusion tends to be the result of self-marginalisation.",2019"Zigron, Shimrit; Bronstein, Jenny",Help is where you find it: The role of weak ties networks as sources of information and support in virtual health communities,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,"Virtual health communities allow people with health-related concerns to engage in supportive communication with individuals coping with similar problems that would be difficult or impossible to form in the face-to-face world.

In this study, we demonstrate that social networks and policy makers may use an IT-facilitated intervention-displaying things in common (TIC) between users (mutual hometown, interest, education, work, city)-to encourage friendship formation, especially among people who are different from each other. Displaying TIC may update an individual's belief about the shared similarity with another and reduce information friction that may be hard to overcome in offline communication. In collaboration with an online social network, we design and implement a randomized field experiment, which randomly varies the prominence of different types of things in common information when a user (viewer) is browsing a non-friend's profile. The dyad-level exogenous variation, orthogonal to any (un)observed structural factors in viewer-profile's network, allows us to cleanly isolate the role of individuals' preference for TIC in driving network formation and homophily. We find that displaying TIC to viewers may significantly increase their probability of sending a friend request and forming a friendship, and is especially effective for pairs of people who have little in common. Such findings suggest that information intervention is a very effective and zero-cost approach to encourage the formation of weak ties, and also provide the first experimental evidence on the crucial role of individuals' preference (versus structural embeddedness) in network formation. We further demonstrate that displaying TIC could improve friendship formation for a wide range of viewers with different demographics and friendship status, and is more effective when the TIC information is more surprising to the viewer. Our study offers actionable insights to social networks and policy makers on the design of information intervention to encourage friendship formation and improve the diversity of the friendship, at both an aggregate and an individual level.

Few studies focus on weak ties, although they are important. In this paper, we propose a novel sign prediction model based on the nodes features in the network, including the Jaccard similarity and the ratio of the negative degrees of all nodes, and the autoencoder technology that self-defines its loss function with the features of the communities. The proposed model maps the original network to a low-dimensional space so that the weak ties can be represented by low-dimensional vectors.

Open distance learning (ODL) institutions typically accommodate students from diverse educational backgrounds with disparate levels of access to technological resources. The mere existence of an online learning platform does not necessarily equate to student access to collaborative learning opportunities. A qualitative study investigated how diverse students in an online learning module collaborated with peers in furthering their learning project at a large ODL university. It emerges that students engage in various formal and informal collaborative learning activities which constitute the creation of personal learning environments (PLEs). PLEs demonstrate the role of student agency as students coordinate their options. Social capital theory shows how different types of social ties in PLEs provide for bonding and bridging social capital; the combination of which serves the learning project by providing for both strong ties in supportive relationships between students and weak ties with knowledge generation capabilities between previously unacquainted students. The results can assist online learning practitioners who wish to promote beneficial collaborative learning opportunities among their students.,2019"Gao, Jie; Schoenebeck, Grant; Yu, Fang-Yi",The Volatility of Weak Ties: Co-evolution of Selection and Influence in Social Networks,AAMAS '19: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS,"In this work we look at opinion formation and the effects of two phenomena both of which promote consensus between agents connected by ties: influence, agents changing their opinions to match their neighbors; and selection, agents re-wiring to connect to new agents when the existing neighbor has a different opinion. In our agent-based model, we assume that only weak ties can be rewired and strong ties do not change. The network structure as well as the opinion landscape thus co-evolve with two important parameters: the probability of influence versus selection; and the fraction of strong ties versus weak ties. Using empirical and theoretical methodologies we discovered that on a two-dimensional spatial network: With no/low selection the presence of weak ties enables fast consensus. This conforms with the classical theory that weak ties are helpful for quickly mixing and spreading information, and strong ties alone act much more slowly. With high selection, too many weak ties inhibit any consensus at all-the graph partitions. The weak ties reinforce the differing opinions rather than mixing them. However, sufficiently many strong ties promote convergence, though at a slower pace. We additionally test the aforementioned results using a real network. Our study relates two theoretical ideas: the strength of weak tiesthat weak ties are useful for spreading information; and the idea of echo chambers or filter bubbles, that people are typically bombarded by the opinions of like-minded individuals.

Design/methodology/approach A case study of a Scottish labour market was undertaken which involved an interview-based survey of those who became unemployed in their early 50's and tried to regain employment. The interview had structured and unstructured parts which allowed both quantitative and qualitative analysis to compare those who were successful in regaining work with those who were not. The uniqueness of the paper is the use of social network components while controlling for other socio-economic and demographic variables in job search of older workers. Findings Those older people who were unemployed and, returned to employment (reemployed) had a higher proportion of contacts with higher prestige jobs, their job searching methods were mainly interpersonal and the rate of finding their last job via their social networks was higher than those who remained unemployed. Both groups mobilised social capital (MSC), but those reemployed accessed higher quality social capital. Strong ties, rather than weak ties, were found to be important in accessing and mobilising social capital for the older workers who returned to employment. Research limitations/implications This work is limited to a local labour market and is based on a small but informative sample. However, it does show that policy is required to allow older people to enhance their social networks by strengthening the social capital embedded in the networks. The results support the use of intermediaries as bridges to help compensate for older people who have weak social networks. Besides the policy implications, the paper also has two distinct research implications. First, the use of social network component to the existing literature of older workers' job search. Second, exploring the type and relational strength with network members to explain older workers' reemployment. Practical implications The paper illustrates that how accessed and MSC can be measured. Social implications As populations age, this work points to an approach to support older people to re-enter employment and to include them in society. Originality/value The paper extends social network and employment literature to fill gaps on how older people require to both access and mobilise social capital. The importance of strong ties in the reemployment of older workers contrasts with much of the literature on younger workers where the strength of weak ties so far has been regarded as essential for successful job search. Measures are forwarded to reveal the relevance of social capital. The policy value of the work is in suggesting ways to facilitate older people re-enter or remain in work and hence sustain their well-being.",2019"Patulny, Roger; Ramia, Gaby; Feng, Zhuqin; Peterie, Michelle; Marston, Greg","The strong, the weak and the meaningful: Do friends or acquaintances help us get ""any"" job, or ""meaningful"" work?",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY,"Purpose Governments increasingly promote employment through social networks (whether via formal job networks or informal personal networks). However, they rarely account for how weak-tie bridging networks and strong-tie bonding networks differentially affect employment outcomes. Given criticism that (usually weak-tie bridging-focussed) formal job networks are overly focussed on finding entry-level (i.e. any) jobs, it is imperative to understand the impact of strong and weak ties on securing work with good conditions, or of meaning to the worker. Such links are poorly understood in the present literature. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach This study uses national Australian survey data to assess whether support from close friends or distant acquaintances is associated with employment outcomes such as finding any work or meaningful work. Findings The results show that relatively distant ties (close acquaintances) and emotional support from friends are each associated with reduced chances of being an unemployed/discouraged worker. Stronger ties (close friends) are associated with better chances of a having a meaningful job. Practical implications More attention should be paid to tie strength dynamics and meaningful employment outcomes in the delivery of employment services. In particular, a role for active close-tie brokers in promoting networks should be investigated, instead of expecting/pushing the unemployed to rely on either extremely close or distant connections.

Findings Results indicate that enterprise leadership staff facilitate opportunities to employees to increase and maintain their affiliations. Leadership staff provide a supportive environment, allowing employees to gain social skills and feelings of utility that result in their building and maintaining affiliations. However, leadership staff confront high turn-over, addiction and mental illness among employees, which result in disaffiliation.

Therefore, the focus of this study is to create an integrated value for immigrant entrepreneurs by combining the CSR theory and mix embeddedness theory, and find an alternative concept of practice for understanding the drivers that can sustain the micro businesses of immigrants in Lapland and can give an explanation on opportunities recognition which can be embedded so as to get access to the necessary entrepreneurial capital (local, regional or national). This study argues that the degree of CSR embeddedness could be developed as a component of mixed embeddedness supports the discovery of institutional, social and economic opportunity strategy amongst immigrant entrepreneurs.

Reciprocity is considered a principle of interpersonal and social relations, presupposing the existence of explicit and latent mutual obligations among their participants. Empirical diagnostics was centered on parameters of family-related, friendly, neighborly, professional networks of mutual aid as intensity and regularity of functioning, the focus of resource transfers, the nature of mutuality of obligations, motivation for the exchange of resources. The exchange of resources with parents and full-grown children is characterized by the highest degree of intensity. Most participants in such exchanges do not expect an equivalent volume of response services, and these interactions themselves have the character of generalized reciprocity. As we move toward ""weak"" ties (neighbors, colleagues, acquaintances), the attitude of balanced reciprocity dominates: receiving assistance, 50 to 57% of respondents expect an equivalent return. In the motivation of mutual aid, the attitude to a balanced reciprocity is most clearly expressed in professional and neighboring networks. In relations with friends, it is balanced by emotional-value and existential motives, which are dominant in family-related relationships. The normative significance of the principle of reciprocity and its system-forming character in various types of mutual aid networks is substantiated, and it has been proved that reciprocity in family ties has, first of all, an emotional-psychological and value background, in other networks of mutual aid the balanced nature of resource exchanges is a condition for their stable functioning.",2019"Park, Chang Sup; Gil de Zuniga, Homero",The impact of mobile communication uses on civic engagement: moderating effects of exposure to politically diverse and weak-tie networks,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS,"Based on a nationally representative survey (N = 1,540) of mobile phone users, this study investigates how diverse types of mobile phone use relate to exposure to different political and social views (i.e., crosscutting exposure), attributes of people's discussion network (i.e., weak-tie contacts), and civic engagement. Results indicate that using mobile phones for informational and expressive purposes is closely linked to exposure to diverse viewpoints through mobile communication and engagement in civic affairs. Recreational use of the mobile phone has a statistically significant link to crosscutting exposure.

We designed a survey instrument based on the Network Scale-Up Method and implemented it in a national survey in Spain. Our results suggest that Spaniards have approximately 536 acquaintances, with a large inter-individual variation, comparable to the estimates reported for the American population. Acquaintanceship volume varies with gender, age, education, and income. These differences are partially related to the unequal participation of social groups in voluntary associations, confirming the civic value of such associations, and in employment.

There are many complex reasons for suboptimal breastfeeding rates, including social and societal factors. Alongside increasing social media use worldwide, there is an expanding research focus on how social media use affects health behaviours, decisions and perceptions. The objective of this study was to systematically determine if and how breastfeeding is promoted and supported on the popular social media platform Instagram, which currently has over 700 million active users worldwide. To assess how Instagram is used to depict and portray breastfeeding, and how users share perspectives and information about this topic, we analysed 4,089 images and 8,331 corresponding comments posted with popular breastfeeding-related hashtags (#breastfeeding, #breastmilk, #breastisbest, and #normalizebreastfeeding). We found that Instagram is being mobilized by users to publicly display and share diverse breastfeeding-related content and to create supportive networks that allow new mothers to share experiences, build confidence, and address challenges related to breastfeeding.

In this light we present a new mechanism of preferential learning based on dynamic relationship into evolutionary spatial prisoner's dilemma game to further investigate the incentive mechanisms of cooperative behaviors. In detail, we consider that the strength of relationship between pairwise individuals adaptively changes according to their mutual strategies and the adjusting rate is related to individuals' sensitivity to interactions. Based on the heterogeneous and dynamic relationship, individuals prefer neighbors with stronger relationship to learn from instead of learning randomly The learning preference is measured by the preference intensity. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, we find that both the sensitivity factor and the preference intensity have multiple effects on the evolution of cooperation. Furthermore, to validate the multiple effects in a microcosmic view, strategy transitions during the evolution are also discussed. Interestingly, we find that there exists a trade-off between the influence of the sensitivity factor and the preference intensity on the evolution of cooperation. Presented results are robust to variations of the network structures and may provide a new understanding to the emergence of cooperative behaviors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A common way to quantify the nature of the links between individuals is to consider repeated interactions: frequently occurring interactions indicate strong ties, such as friendships, while ties with low weights can indicate random encounters. Here we focus on a different dimension: rather than the strength of links, we study physical distance between individuals when a link is activated. The findings presented here are based on a dataset of proximity events in a population of approximately 500 individuals. To quantify the impact of the physical proximity on the dynamic network, we use a simulated epidemic spreading processes in two distinct networks of physical proximity. We consider the network of short-range interactions defined as d less than or similar to 1 meter, and the long-range which includes all interactions d less than or similar to 10 meters. Since these two networks arise from the same set of underlying behavioral data, we are able to quantitatively measure how the specific definition of the proximity network - short-range versus long-range - impacts the resulting network structure as well as spreading dynamics in epidemic simulations. We find that the short-range network - consistent with the literature - is characterized by densely-connected neighborhoods bridged by weak ties. More surprisingly, however, we show that spreading in the long-range network is quite different, mainly shaped by spurious interactions.",2018"Coleman, J. Mark; Rice, Margaret L.; Wright, Vivian H.",Educator Communities of Practice on Twitter,JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE ONLINE LEARNING,"As Twitter became a popular platform for social networking, educators gravitated to the platform for professional networking. Educators began to utilize the hashtag #edchat to denote their ongoing and growing conversations on education subjects. Educational institutions began to require teachers to participate in the platform or would grant continuing education credits for their participation. To determine if such sanction is merited, a qualitative exploration of the network of educators on the Twitter platform was performed. Posts to Twitter containing the #edchat hashtag were collected and a survey instrument was disseminated with the #edchat hashtag. Collected posts and their linked content were coded according to their content. Demographic qualities of the participants in the #edchat community were addressed as well as questions arising from coding, such as the nature of retweeting and the role of commercial entities in the community. From these codes a set of distinct categories of #edchat Twitter posts were analyzed and discussed. The themes of these posts were determined and related to the literature. The survey instrument allowed exploration of motives and perceptions of the impact of #edchat participation, and how these perceptions related to the themes of the collected posts. Participants in the #edchat conversations were found to be generating social capital and binding a community together through the weak ties of brief interactions.

While some of our findings support previous work, others challenge previous research and general expectations about race and crime. Contrary to victimization patterns observed in the aggregate data, our panel data models identify consistent patterns of reported violence committed by White individuals against Blacks and Hispanics across neighborhoods. Specifically, in the presence of controls for neighborhood and time effects, Whites are more likely to assault and use weapons against Blacks and Hispanics than Blacks and Hispanics are to assault or use weapons against Whites. On the other hand, Blacks and Hispanics are typically more likely to commit robbery (crimes which we characterize as being often related to economic motives) against Whites than the reverse. We estimate these effects across the racial composition and earnings distribution of neighborhoods in Los Angeles County and find significant heterogeneity in the propensity for certain types of crimes to occur as a function of the race/ethnic match of suspect and victim.

The case study investigates the role of users and their social ties in influencing the popularisation of solar water heaters in a latecomer city Dezhou, in contrast to a more developed counterpart, Beijing. The two cities show vast differences in user preferences towards the low-tech environmental innovation, and the stronger social ties in Dezhou facilitate the diffusion through not only frequent social learning and peer pressure, but also enhancing user-producer trust and relation. These findings suggest that latecomer cities could provide less harsh selection environments for disruptive environmental innovations and their comparatively homogenous social ties could be harnessed to empower niche development.",2018"Redshaw, Sarah; Ingham, Valerie",'Neighbourhood is if they come out and talk to you': Neighbourly connections and bonding social capital,JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,"Neighbourly relations have been theorised as 'friendly distance' in contrast to connections which are theorised as strong or intensive ties. The article explores the neighbourly relationships between residents of a peri-urban regional area outside Sydney in Australia. Strong interview themes emerged regarding the ways in which residents who were well connected within their locality talked about their neighbours, and this was in direct contrast to those living with a chronic condition - these people expressed a lack of connection with their neighbours. The major theme, 'not in each other's pockets' reflects the negotiated nature of neighbour interactions, while the theme 'neighbourhood is if they come out and talk to you' speaks of isolation. The interactions of neighbours may in many cases constitute bonding capital as important weak or casual ties.

By conceptualizing chance meetings and connecting them with social network theory, we get closer to predicting where people precisely travel and what activities they engage in at particular points in time. This socially embedded perspective transcends the importance of attractions and activities as object of reference between traveler and place.

Using a qualitative case study methodology, this study is based on primary data collected from Australian law firms and corporate client organizations, and compares and contrasts the views of lawyers and clients on building social and human capital. Our study finds that the relative importance of strong ties diminishes as professional services globalize and weak ties become viewed as more prominent for successful internationalization. The main findings indicate three different sets of inter-relationships between social and human capital: complementary, supplementary and compensatory. We discuss the complementary and supplementary effects of strong and weak ties and three different types of knowledge resources (technical, market and client-specific knowledge). We also argue that knowledge resources of technical and market knowledge can compensate network ties in the internationalization of firms.

Several studies have shown that heterogeneous groups are superior to homogeneous groups when novel or creative solutions need to be developed to deal with tasks characterized by high task uncertainty. For boundary spanners in engineering project groups, it is proposed that cross-departmental technical advice links are another source of the information needed to deal with task uncertainty. An empirical test supports the proposition that for high-performing project groups, boundary-spanning technical advice links may compensate for a lack of internal group heterogeneity and vice versa. This is not the case for low-performing project groups.

The paper contributes to this debate by reporting on a small-N study that relies on a unique combination of ethnographic data, social network analysis, and computational models. In particular, we investigate two rural populations of Indian and Kenyan potters who have to decide whether to adopt new, objectively more efficient and economically more attractive, technical/stylistic options. Qualitative field data show that religious sub-communities within the Indian and Kenyan populations exhibit markedly different diffusion rates and speed over the last thirty years. To account for these differences, we first analyze empirically observed kinship networks and advice networks, and, then, we recreate the actual aggregate diffusion curves through a series of empirically calibrated agent-based simulations. Combining the two methods, we show that, while single exposure through heterophilious weak ties were sufficient to initiate the diffusion process, large bridges made of strong ties can in fact lead to faster or slower diffusion depending on the type of signals circulating in the network. We conclude that, even in presence of complex contagions, dense local ties cannot be regarded as a sufficient condition for faster diffusion.",2018"Kim, Sang Kyun; Shin, Shung Jae; Shin, Jiseon; Miller, Douglas R.",Social Networks and Individual Creativity: The Role of Individual Differences,JOURNAL OF CREATIVE BEHAVIOR,"This article addresses the theoretical limitations of social network theory as it applies to individual creativity.

Building on an interactional approach, this article explores the role of individual differences in the relationship between social networks and individual creativity and proposes that weak ties enhance creativity when information recipients are highly open to experience, have more domain knowledge, have an innovative style, and are intrinsically motivated.

Our goal was to measure the degree of expertise of the potters distributed between early and late adopters of the kiln. Our results are discussed in the light of oral interviews.

The Productive Tension Between Network Governance and Reflexivity,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING,"Theories of reflexive governance are closely linked with the claim that more traditional modes of coordination have been replaced by networked structures, allowing reflexivity to emerge and reflexive learning to function as a steering mechanism in rapidly changing policy contexts. This paper explores this connection between reflexivity, governance, learning and networks in societal transitions, focusing particularly on the claim that networks will deliver reflexive learning. Using network theories from both policy networks and network governance and a case study of the Canadian agricultural biotechnology (agbiotech) policy network, it suggests that the kind of learning produced in networks will be a function of network structure. In particular, higher order reflexive learning will be compromised by the inevitability of the political struggle for nodality or central place in networks and the ensuing distribution of opportunities for bridging and bonding activities. Networks such as the Canadian agbiotech policy network that may promote learning but not necessarily reflexive learning are increasingly disadvantaged in contemporary policy settings.",2018"Botelho, Tristan L.",Here's an Opportunity: Knowledge Sharing Among Competitors as a Response to Buy-in Uncertainty,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,"Although knowledge sharing among competitors is seemingly counterintuitive, scholars have found that competitors share knowledge under certain conditions: among actors who have a preexisting relationship and who expect direct reciprocity.

Using a unique data set of knowledge sharing among investment professionals on a digital platform, this study leverages variation in the platform's knowledge-sharing structure to test this theory.

Large multinational organizations may rely on transactive memory systems as a means of sharing knowledge and helping employees to accomplish day-to-day tasks. Research demonstrates that new information communication technology facilitates the development of transactive memory systems, but the role of transactive memory in virtual work arrangements is less studied. This article explores how dimensions of virtual work impact transactive memory systems. Data were collected from a large multinational organization that provides technology consulting services. Findings from this study demonstrate a clear relationship between the formation of transactive memory systems and the degree of geographic dispersion of employees. Moreover, the formation of transactive memory systems is negatively impacted by the diversity of teams' job functions. The use of internal information communication technology plays a positive role in influencing organizational memory when teams are geographically and functionally diverse.

Behavioral-lab research typically exposes human subjects to experimental manipulations, or treatments, to make causal inferences by observing variation in response to the treatment. ABM researchers ascribe individual simulated ""agents"" with decision rules describing their behavior and subsequently attempt to replicate ""macro"" level empirical patterns. Integration of ABM and lab experiments presents advantages for both sets of researchers. ABM researchers will benefit from exposure to a larger set of empirically validated mechanisms that can add nuance and refinement to their models of human behavior and system dynamics. Lab-oriented researchers will gain from ABM a method for assessing the validity and magnitude of their findings, adjudicating between competing mechanisms, developing new theory to test in the lab, and exploring macro-level, long-run implications of subtle, micro-level observations that can be difficult to observe in the field.

One major theme emerged: highly involved white members described their close friends of color in utilitarian terms and not integrated into daily activities outside of the interracial organization. This theme, named the ""one friend rule,"" is a micro-level mechanism where whites mobilize a ""close"" interracial tie to project a generalized value for diversity while simultaneously limiting access to personal resources.

We measure social integration with the level of trust and the level of public participation (objective dimension) and with individuals' self-evaluation of whether they are integrated (subjective dimension). Our results show that while the size and heterogeneity of the egocentric network are positively associated, the proportion of relatives among strong ties correlates negatively with objective indicators of social integration. The heterogeneity of weak ties is related positively to public participation. The correlation between the size and composition of egocentric networks and subjective integration is less clear: The proportion of relatives among strong ties seems to be unrelated to the external side of perceived social integration, while it is associated positively with the internal side of subjective integration. The number of strong ties seems to be positively correlated with both sides of subjective integration.

As long as family ties are sufficiently valuable, there is a trade-off between aggregate social utility and economic performance, and small world networks are then socially optimal.

It investigates the impact of online referral reward programs on receivers' responses from the perspectives of social norms and market norms. We identify the moderating conditions that are expected to affect when and how a reward leads the receiver to infer social norms, thereby increasing the referral's effectiveness. In study 1, because receivers with different tie may have relationships based on market norms or social norms (Wentzel et al. in J Serv Res 17(2):119-133, 2014), we examine the effect of tie strength and reward allocation on receivers' responses in online referral reward programs. Furthermore, we extended the analysis of study 1 in two ways through the introduction of brand relationships and reward characteristics. In study 2, we introduced brand relationships to analyze the effect of tie strength and reward allocation on receivers' responses. In study 3, we studied the effects of reward type and tie strength on receivers' responses in online referral reward programs. To capture the underlying process, we also examined the participants' perceptions of social cost in three studies. Finally, we conclude by discussing the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings. People with strong ties tended to accept a referral more often than those with weak ties, because people with strong ties gave their friends' benefits more consideration. However, in strong brand relationships, receivers with strong ties in No Reward conditions tend to respond to referrals more than those with strong ties in the Reward Recommender conditions, because rewarding recommenders makes social norms transfer into market norms. This paper extended the theory on effect of reward on receivers' responses in online referral reward programs and further verified that social cost was a key element of psychological mechanism that caused reward to strengthen receivers' responses under market norms or social norms. This paper researched how social norms and market norms affected consumers' behaviors differently, which helped company design online referral reward programs. This paper researched the relationships between market norms and social norms on receivers' responses in online social network.",2018"Soetanto, Danny; Huang, Qihai; Jack, Sarah","Obstacles, Networking Approaches and Entrepreneurial Network Changes",EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW,"While recent work has considered network change, little is known about how certain factors determine such changes. This study focuses on two factors - the type of obstacles entrepreneurs face and their networking approach - and employs a two-stage research design and network visualisation approach to capture entrepreneurs' experiences in managing networks during their entrepreneurial journey. Using an inductive approach, the first stage of the study identifies the obstacles and networking approaches that influence different types of network changes. The second stage employs a deductive approach to test the hypotheses developed from the first stage using a larger sample. We find that in experiencing obstacles from internal sources, entrepreneurs are more likely to find support from weak ties while strong ties are beneficial for overcoming obstacles from external sources. In having difficulties in acquiring entrepreneurial knowledge and skills, entrepreneurs are more likely to develop a low-density network consisting of many structural holes. Conversely, dealing with difficulties in accessing market and resources imposes over-reliance on high-density network. Furthermore, the entrepreneurs' networking approaches also influence network changes and partially mediate the relationship between the networks and the obstacles they face.",2018"Monteban, Madalena F.; Bess, Kimberly D.; Walsh, Colleen C.; Baily, Heather; Flocke, Susan A.; Borawski, Elaine A.; Freedman, Darcy A.",People and places shaping food procurement among recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),HEALTH & PLACE,"A key gap in existing food environment research is a more complex understanding of the interplay between physical and social contexts, including the influence of social networks on food habits.

Results highlight the significance of social connections as motivators to use food places, the value of access to information and other resources at food places, and the role of weak ties with actors within food places to facilitate utilization and interaction.

Many studies have investigated how different types of communication activities and communications media influence knowledge sharing. We contribute to this literature by examining increasingly prevalent yet understudied IT-mediated social interactions and their effects on knowledge sharing among employees in comparison to face-to-face social connections. By integrating the literature on knowledge sharing, social networks, and information systems, we theorize the ability of IT-mediated social interaction to (1) afford interactions between individuals with heterogeneous backgrounds and (2) facilitate frequent IT-mediated social interactions that are high in competence-based trustboth supporting effective sharing of knowledge. Through a social network analysis of the employees in a high-tech organization, this study finds that IT-mediated frequent social interactions are the most effective in promoting knowledge sharing.",2018"Frank, Kenneth A.; Xu, Ran; Penuel, William R.",IMPLEMENTATION OF EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE IN HUMAN SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: IMPLICATIONS FROM AGENT-BASED MODELS,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,"Much of the impact of a policy depends on how it is implemented, especially as mediated by organizations such as schools or hospitals. Here, we focus on how implementation of evidence-based practices in human service organizations (e.g., schools, hospitals) is affected by intraorganizational network dynamics. In particular, we hypothesize intraorganizational behavioral divergence and network polarization are likely to occur when actors strongly identify with their organizations. Using agent-based models, we find that when organizational identification is high, external change agents who attempt to direct organizations by introducing policy aligned messages (e.g., professional development emphasizing specific teaching practices) may unintentionally contribute to divergence in practice and polarization in networks, inhibiting full implementation of the desired practices as well as reducing organizational capacity to absorb new practices. Thus, the external change agent should consider the interaction between the type of message and the intraorganizational network dynamics driven by organizational identification.",2018"Berry, Heather",The Influence of Multiple Knowledge Networks on Innovation in Foreign Operations,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,"Although extant literature has long argued that firm embeddedness within knowledge networks increases innovation, we know much less about how interactions across multiple knowledge networks jointly influence learning and innovation outcomes within firms. This paper contributes to our understanding of global innovation in multinational corporations (MNCs) by exploring how competing tensions across parent, host-country, and third-country knowledge networks in terms of knowledge domain diversity and dominance, organizational bias, and knowledge relevance perceptions influence innovation outcomes. Empirical results from a comprehensive panel of U.S. MNCs reveal different ""preferred"" combinations of high and low embeddedness across parent, host-country, and third-country knowledge networks for incremental versus radical innovation outcomes, reflecting how competing tensions across knowledge networks can limit or enhance knowledge search for diverse knowledge and influence innovation outcomes in the foreign operations of MNCs.",2018"Behler, Rachel; Suh, Chan; Brashears, Matthew; Shi, Yongren","Familiar faces, familiar spaces: Social similarity and co-presence in non-relational behavioral convergence",NETWORK SCIENCE,"Social influence is frequently measured through an ego's direct ties.

We identify and trace the influence stemming from an ego's ""familiar others,"" consisting of those socially similar individuals with whom the ego comes in contact at school, but does not necessarily share a relationship. To evaluate the role of familiar others, we investigate unhealthy weight behaviors in adolescence using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Our results demonstrate that familiar others' unhealthy weight-related behaviors are strong predictors of the ego's own weight behaviors, net of immediate alters' behaviors, and individual-level characteristics. Further, we find that this relationship is stronger and more robust than that between egos and their direct ties. These results suggest that familiar others constitute a key source of social influence that is distinct from the influence of network alters.",2018"Hagler, Matthew A.; Rhodes, Jean E.",The Long-Term Impact of Natural Mentoring Relationships: A Counterfactual Analysis,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY,"Previous research suggests that youth's natural mentoring relationships are associated with better academic, vocational, and psychosocial functioning. However, little is known about the extent to which the impact of mentoring endures beyond adolescence and early adulthood. Furthermore, most natural mentoring research is confounded by selection bias. In this study, we examined the long-term impact of mentoring using the nationally representative, longitudinal Add Health dataset. We conducted counterfactual analysis, a more stringent test of causality than regression-based approaches. Compared to their unmentored counterparts, adults (ages 33-42) who had a natural mentor during adolescence or emerging adulthood reported higher educational attainment, more time spent volunteering, and more close friends, after controlling for a range of confounding factors. However, outcomes differed when mentors were classified as strong ties (e.g., grandparents, friends) or weak ties (e.g., teachers, coaches, employers). Having a strong-tie mentor was associated with having more close friends and a lower income. In contrast, having a weak-tie mentor was associated with higher educational attainment, higher income, and more time spent volunteering. These findings suggest that natural mentoring relationships can exert lasting influence on young people's developmental trajectories, providing strong rationale for efforts to expand their availability and scope. Highlights Among the first studies to use counterfactual analysis to examine the impact of natural mentoring. To our knowledge, the first natural mentoring study to examine outcomes beyond early adulthood. Highlighted differential impact of weak- and strong-tie mentors.

Australia's national strategies have highlighted the need for public health interventions for priority populations. One approach is to expand efforts to places or spaces where expatriate communities reside. Online settings such as forums used by expatriates and travelers have potential for preventing sexually transmissible infections with those hard to reach through more traditional interventions. Objective: Our objectives were to (1) identify and describe domains of social interaction and engagement in 1 online forum used by Australian expatriates and travelers living or working in Thailand; and (2) make recommendations to health-promoting organizations and policy makers regarding the role of these forums in public health interventions with mobile populations who may be at risk of acquiring HIV or other sexually transmissible infections. Methods: We identified forums and users in 2 stages. We identified 13 online forums and analyzed them for inclusion criteria. We searched 1 forum that met the required criteria for users who met inclusion criteria (n=5). Discussion threads, rather than individual posts, were units of analysis. For each user, we collected as transcripts the first 100 posts and 10 most recent posts, including the thread in which they were posted. We analyzed and thematically coded each post (n=550). Transcripts and analyses were reviewed and refined by multiple members of the research team to improve rigor. Themes were not totally emergent but explored against symbolic interactionism concepts of presentation of self, meaning, and socialization. Results: Key domains were as follows: the forum (characteristics of the space and reasons for use), gaining access (forum hierarchy and rules), identity (presentation of self and role of language), advice, support, and information (sources of information, support provided, influencers, topics of discussion, and receptiveness to advice), and risk (expectations and perceptions). The forum exhibited evidence of unique language, rules and norms, and processes for managing conflict and key influencers. The forum was a substantial source of health information and advice provided to users via confirmation, reassurance, or affirmation of beliefs and experiences. Risk perception and expectations varied. Risk taking, including around sex, appeared to be a key expectation of travel or the experience of being an expatriate or traveler. Conclusions: Australian expatriate and long-term traveler participation in the online forum formed, influenced, and reinforced knowledge, attitudes, interaction, and identity. Such forums can be used by policy makers and health-promoting organizations to provide supplementary sources of support and information to hard-to-reach mobile populations who may be at risk of acquiring HIV or other sexually transmissible infections.

In particular, Twitter, whose user base is skewed toward those who disproportionately affect news coverage, and by extension the public agenda, represents a particularly useful platform for policy advocates wishing to grow their audience. This article extends theoretical understandings of information flows and the growth of networked discussion spaces by examining the online discussion space around a Universal Basic Income (UBI), which has been proposed to alleviate social tensions relating to joblessness resulting from technological advances. Using content analysis and statistical methods, we show that tweets in the UBI discussion space that inform others are the most likely to be shared, but tweets that emotionally resonate with users are the most likely to reach new audiences and therefore bring new actors into the discussion space. These findings contribute to the literature on viral events and dynamic networks, providing insight into how policies like UBI are discussed and diffuse on social media platforms like Twitter.",2018"Choi, Sujin; Yang, Joshua SungWoo; Chen, Wenhong",Longitudinal Change of an Online Political Discussion Forum: Antecedents of Discussion Network Size and Evolution,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,"By analyzing 13-month longitudinal digital trace data, we examined why some people have larger discussion networks than others and which communication and relational characteristics contribute to the evolution of discussion network ties.

Discussants' average network size was 4.6, and discussants retained one out of five members after more than one year. Those who had larger networks tended to participate in more conversations rather than staying longer or showing up more frequently. One's reputation or potential political heterogeneity from the general consensus of the forum did not influence one's network size.

Here this is addressed in a study of young job-seekers that adopted an egocentric network approach underpinned by Information Behaviour theory, with specific reference to Wilson's model of information needs and seeking. The analysis of data from semi-structured interviews reveals that job-seekers acquire a broad range of job search information from contacts in their networks, and that the contributions of such contacts extend beyond the sharing of job vacancy alerts. In addition, in cases where social media platforms are accessed by job-seekers, these facilitate crucial ties to industry contacts, and provide valuable informational opportunities to those who adopt them. These findings contribute to a widened understanding of the information behaviours that support the effective mobilisation of contacts within social networks during job search, and are of particular interest to policy-makers whose remit includes the employability of the youth labour force.",2018"Lane, John L.; Sweeny, Shannon P.","COLLEAGUES, CHALLENGES, AND HELP PROVISION How Early Career Teachers Construct Their Social Networks to Help Them with the Endemic Challenges of Teaching",ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL,"This article examines the challenges that 18 elementary school early career teachers (ECTs) faced and the colleagues they used to help them meet these challenges.

Second, although ECTs relied primarily on grade-level colleagues and instructional coaches for help with instructional matters, they used a wide variety of colleagues (e.g., administrators, certified specialist, proximal and distal peers) to help them with other challenges.

Comparison is drawn between small firms engaged in strategic (e.g., professional associations) and social (e.g., family, informal relationships) alliances. The study uses multiple regression analysis on a representative sample of 100 small firms in West Bengal, India. Analysis largely supports the hypothesis that social capital provides innovation support to small firms, which consequently translates into improved firm performance. For firms embedded in strategic alliances, results were more pronounced, thus substantiating the advantage for small firms in India to join and activate social capital within strategic networks to overcome the constraints in generating and developing innovativeness. Implications for small firms and professional associations are discussed.",2018"Shi, Yingjie; Zhu, Xuechang; Liu, Bin; Li, Lei",Social networks and the wages of job seekers: the case of China,SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING,"This research empirically explores whether the intensity of social networks affects the wages of workers or not using survey data from the Chinese households' income project in 2002. After controlling for gender, work experience, political affiliation, marital status, years of education and other factors, we show that the social networks are useful for the job hunter to find jobs, but they have little contributions to higher wages. Further studies indicate that the social networks with ""strong ties"" for job seekers are not conducive to enhancing the wages of workers. However, the social networks with ""weak ties"" have a lower job hunting probability and heterogeneity benefit for improving wage levels. Furthermore, we employ family dynamic survey data from China in 2006 to make robustness check, and results are still robust.",2018"Sutcliffe, Alistair G.; Binder, Jens F.; Dunbar, Robin I. M.",Activity in social media and intimacy in social relationships,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,"We investigated associations between online and offline socialising and groups of social ties as postulated by the Social Brain Hypothesis (SBH). An online survey of social media use, social satisfaction and loneliness generated 249 complete responses from a sample of staff and students at the University of Manchester. Regression-based analyses showed that offline social activities and social time were positively associated with size of a core support group and social satisfaction. In contrast, social media time was positively associated with social satisfaction and the size of the total network, while the number of online contacts was positively related to social satisfaction, size of a wider sympathy group and total network size. No effect for loneliness was found. The number of ties reported for each SBH group was similar to that in previous studies. The more intimate support group (-5) appears to be more closely connected with offline social activities, whereas social media use and contacts influence the less intimate sympathy group (-15) and total network (-150). These findings provide further support for functional differences between different layers of closeness in personal networks, and they help us in further defining the boundaries of relationship enhancement via communication technology.

In these studies, the size of an average job seeker's network was much smaller and limited by the available modes of communication and the costs associated with maintaining social connections. However, the recent growth of online social networks has enabled job seekers to stay connected with many connections, weak or strong. Thus, the number of online connections-especially weak-has increased significantly. In this paper, we first examine whether an individual's social network plays a role in driving job search behavior, taking into account online social networking sites (e.g., Linkedln) and other job search modes. Second, we examine how ties in online social networks (both weak and strong) affect job search outcomes (modeled sequentially as job leads, interviews, and offers), and we compare the findings to job outcomes from traditional job search modes (e.g., career fairs, newspaper, Internet postings, and friends and family). To do so, we first construct an economic model of search behavior incorporating cost and benefit functions; we then estimate the model to recover structural parameters using the survey data of 424 users. Our findings show that users are spending more time searching for jobs on social networking sites. In addition, users' strong ties play a significant role in job search and are especially helpful in generating job leads, interviews, and offers; the weak ties, on average, are ineffective in generating positive outcomes and marginally negative in some cases.",2018"DuGoff, Eva H.; Fernandes-Taylor, Sara; Weissman, Gary E.; Huntley, Joseph H.; Pollack, Craig Evan",A scoping review of patient-sharing network studies using administrative data,TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE,"There is a robust literature examining social networks and health, which draws on the network traditions in sociology and statistics. However, the application of social network approaches to understand the organization of health care is less well understood. The objective of this work was to examine approaches to conceptualizing, measuring, and analyzing provider patient-sharing networks. These networks are constructed using administrative data in which pairs of physicians are considered connected if they both deliver care to the same patient. A scoping review of English language peer-reviewed articles in PubMed and Embase was conducted from inception to June 2017. Two reviewers evaluated article eligibility based upon inclusion criteria and abstracted relevant data into a database. The literature search identified 10,855 titles, of which 63 full-text articles were examined. Nine additional papers identified by reviewing article references and authors were examined. Of the 49 papers that met criteria for study inclusion, 39 used a cross-sectional study design, 6 used a cohort design, and 4 were longitudinal. We found that studies most commonly theorized that networks reflected aspects of collaboration or coordination. Less commonly, studies drew on the strength of weak ties or diffusion of innovation frameworks. A total of 180 social network measures were used to describe the networks of individual providers, provider pairs and triads, the network as a whole, and patients.

SNS have drastically decreased time and distance constraints of social grooming. In this paper, I show that two types of social grooming (elaborate social grooming and lightweight social grooming) were discovered in a model constructed by 13 communication datasets including face to face, SNS and Chacma baboons. The separation of social grooming methods is caused by a difference in the trade-off between the number and strength of social relationships. The trade-off of elaborate social grooming is weaker than the trade-off of lightweight social grooming. On the other hand, the time and effort of elaborate methods are higher than those of lightweight methods. Additionally, my model connects social grooming behaviour and social relationship forms with these trade-offs. By analysing the model, I show that individuals tend to use elaborate social grooming to reinforce a few close relationships (e.g. face to face and Chacma baboons). By contrast, people tend to use lightweight social grooming to maintain many weak relationships (e.g. SNS). Humans with lightweight methods who live in significantly complex societies use various types of social grooming to effectively construct social relationships.",2018"Naegele, L.; Plath, C.","Weak ties get you in the job, strong ties keep you",ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GERONTOLOGIE UND GERIATRIE,,2018"Laycock, Katherine E.; Caldwell, Wayne",Exploring Community Cohesion in Rural Canada Post-Extreme Weather: Planning Ahead for Unknown Stresses,SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH,"As social capital evolves, we need to better address how we assess it in terms of community connection and involvement.

However, few work considers the weak ties between nodes to control the information propagation. Due to the characteristics of the complementation of information demand and the continuous assimilation of behavior orientation, the weak ties between nodes may be explosive in the process of information propagation, thus they can not be ignored. To solve this problem, considering the impact of strong and weak ties between nodes on information propagation, a propagation control method based on the exact controllability theory is proposed. Firstly, some strong ties between nodes, such as the node's intimacy, authority and interaction frequency are introduced to build the initial tie networks. Secondly, some potential valuable weak ties between nodes are identified and then tie networks are further updated. Finally, the exact controllability theory is used to find the driver node groups, and then the set of driver nodes are selected according to the characteristics of information propagation to control information propagation. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively promote or suppress the information propagation, which provides some ideas for the information propagation control in social networks.",2018"Ozkazanc-Pan, Banu; Muntean, Susan Clark",Networking towards (in)equality: Women entrepreneurs in technology,GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION,"Deploying a multidimensional framework focusing on individual, organizational and societal factors, we investigate gendering practices through which women entrepreneurs become disadvantaged in the technology sector. Through qualitative fieldwork, we focus on women entrepreneurs' experiences networking to access valuable entrepreneurial resources and examine the role of technology incubators and accelerators in facilitating this access. These organizations have the potential to mitigate gender inequities by adopting gender-aware practices such as increasing access to networks and resources that might otherwise be unreachable for women technology entrepreneurs. Focusing simultaneously on the complex intersections of networking, organizational practices at incubators and accelerators, and institutionalized gender norms in society, we outline how different gendering practices work separately and in tandem to marginalize women technology entrepreneurs. We observe that these organizations engage in gender neutral' recruitment practices and promote transactional networking which result in the replication rather than eradication of gender inequality. Moreover, organizational attempts to address gender issues' as they relate to technology entrepreneurs re-inscribe rather than disrupt societal gender norms.

We investigate whether there is a positive nonlinear relationship between female board representation and female executive representation: the trickle-down effect. We investigated 1,387 organizations listed on the Australian Securities Exchange between 2003 and 2012 and found the hypothesized nonlinear trickle-down effect operating between board and executive levels. The trickle-down effect was strongest after 1 year but still significant after 5 years. We investigated two potential moderators of the effect: organization size and gender diversity recommendations. There was no moderating effect of organization size, but contrary to expectations, gender diversity recommendations slowed the trickle-down effect. Our findings suggest that organizations can address the paucity of women at senior organizational levels by starting at the top. Specifically, organizations making multiple appointments of female board members should expect improvements in female executive representation. However, the signaling and advocacy opportunities afforded by female board appointments may be less potent in the context of external interventions. Our findings contribute to the ongoing policy debate about the value of regulatory interventions to increase female representation at senior organizational levels and highlight the need for research on the unintended consequences of these interventions across national contexts.",2018"Hong, Woonki; Gajendran, Ravi Shanker",Explaining dyadic expertise use in knowledge work teams: An opportunity-ability-motivation perspective,JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR,"Organizations use project teams to lower search costs associated with locating expertise by assembling requisite expertise within a single unit. But prior research suggests that availability of expertise in teams does not guarantee its use. When are team members more likely to reach out to their peers for their expertise? To answer this question, this paper develops a theoretical model predicting dyadic expertise use in teams based on the opportunity-ability-motivation framework of behavior in organizations. We argue that 3 complementary conditions influence dyadic expertise use in teams: A focal team member is more likely to use a peer's expertise in a specific domain when the peer is perceived to have valuable expertise (opportunity), when the member is psychologically empowered (motivation), and when the member shares a strong tie with the peer (ability). We tested our framework using a 2-wave dataset consisting of 1,898 observations of dyadic domain-specific peer expertise use based on 71 members rating 166 peers nested within 22 teams. Findings suggest that tie strength and psychological empowerment jointly moderate the relationship between perceived peer expertise level and peer expertise use.",2018"Shen, Jing; Bian, Yanjie",The causal effect of social capital on income: A new analytic strategy,SOCIAL NETWORKS,"This study identifies three groups of job seekers in terms of the channels used to search for jobs: the formal channel involving only official procedures to obtain a job, the informal channel using only social contacts to obtain a job, and the joint channel leveraging both social contacts and official procedures. The analysis of a national sample survey of China shows that joint channel users, due to their relatively higher level of social capital, not only make more job search attempts but also obtain higher income than formal channel users. Meanwhile, joint channel users, because of their relative advantages in both human capital and social capital, not only make more job attempts but also obtain higher income than informal channel users. The two comparisons offer a new strategy to test the causal role social capital plays in labour market success, regardless of whether social capital is exogenous or endogenous to human capital.

Due to the intake of new French religious words, English lexemes and also whole word families undergo semantic transformation and lexical replacement. Other terms, however, survive from the Old English period into the present day, resisting contact-induced pressure. This study shows that the survival of old lexemes into Middle English is largely determined by the extent of their diffusion and frequency of occurrence before the Norman Conquest. It is postulated that two kinds of inherited Old English lexis should be distinguished in the Middle English period: (i) established terms that had belonged to the West Saxon standard and were still preserved in general use by the lower regular clergy, parish priests and the faithful at large, and (ii) terms of limited currency that had failed to spread outside local communities with strong ties and survived for a short time after the Conquest in smaller religious foundations. The innovation and spread of new francophone religious lexis was conditioned by the new preaching practices that began to develop in Europe in the wake of the Fourth Lateran Council and the emergence of mendicant orders. Preachers of the new type were the multilingual innovators who generated new lexis in English and at the same time were instrumental in its diffusion, serving as weak ties between the various levels of the medieval society. Urban middle classes, on the other hand, were the most likely English-speaking early adopters of new norms.",2018"Vasilaky, Kathryn N.; Leonard, Kenneth L.",As Good as the Networks They Keep?

Moroccan, Pakistani, Ecuadorian, and Romanian immigrants residing in Barcelona nominated 25 individuals (i.e., alters) from their habitual social networks and provided demographic (e.g., ethnicity), relationship type (e.g., family, friend, neighbor), and structural (who knew whom) information for each of these alters. Even after controlling for individual-level demographic and acculturation variables, the content and structure of immigrants' personal social networks had unique associations with both types of adjustment and with BII. Specifically, the overall degree of cultural diversity in the network and the amount of Catalan (but not Spanish) weak ties (i.e., acquaintances, colleagues, neighbors) positively predicted these outcomes. Amount of interconnectedness between local coethnic and Catalan/Spanish alters also predicted sociocultural adjustment and BII positively. Finally, against a culture and language similarity hypothesis, Moroccan and Pakistani participants had social networks that were more culturally integrated, relative to Ecuadorians and Romanians. Results from this study attest to the importance of examining actual intercultural relations and going beyond individuals' reported acculturation preferences to understand immigrants' overall adaptation and cultural identity dynamics. Furthermore, results highlight the interplay between interculturalism experienced at the intrapersonal, subjective level (i.e., BII), and at the meso-level (i.e., having culturally diverse networks that also include interethnic ties among alters).",2018"Kim, Hyun Mo; Jung, SunHo; Park, JaeHong",The impact of past performance on information valuation in virtual communities: Empirical study in online stock message boards,INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT,"Unlike other types of virtual communities, individuals participate in online stock message boards for their material needs rather than non-material needs (e.g., sense of belonging). They may seek and read others' opinions to make better investment performances. The value of information in online stock message boards may vary from person to person according to their past investment experiences. However, little is known regarding how their past investment performance influences the value of others' opinions. Therefore, our study investigates how individuals process others' opinions on stock message boards for their investment decisions when they have different levels of past investment performance. We proposed the unique research model with two paths consisting of both online stock message board factors and individual factors to determine continuous use of online stock message boards. We conducted SEM analysis with 452 questionnaire data. The results, first, showed that message boards factors (e.g., satisfaction using others' opinions) have a positive impact on continuous intention to use while their own satisfaction with past investment activities has a negative impact on continuous intention to use. In addition, we believe that this is one of the few papers to examine the moderating role of self-attribution bias on the effects of stock investment performance. Our results indicated that investors with strong self-attribution bias lower the usefulness of opinions when losing money while they increased confidence in their investment-related abilities when achieving a profit from investment.

We examine how self-reported benefits of such upward contacts vary by tie strength and network structures in everyday life. Data were drawn from contact diaries that 137 individuals recorded over seven months in 2014; these diaries captured unique features of 94,353 one-on-one contacts that 137 diary keepers made, along with the estimated tie strength and the extent of embeddedness among network members. Multilevel models with interaction terms show that diary keepers benefit from contacts with people who play higher hierarchical roles and that the benefits become more substantial when the higher-ranked others are weakly tied to the diary keepers and connected with fewer fellow network members. The paper extends contact diary studies to estimate alter-alter ties that help construct comprehensive structures in egocentric networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We theorize that factors such as novelty and legitimacy, appropriation, and integration impact the ability of cluster hires to generate economic value. In turn, we hypothesize that the composition of the cluster hire (degree of expertise overlap and degree of comobility) and its fit with the strategic human capital at the hiring firm are likely to influence these factors to affect firm performance. The results from an archival study of cluster hires in 112 domestic U.S. law firms lend credence to the overarching perspective put forth in this paper, and demonstrate that the performance impact of cluster hiring is contingent on its composition and fit with the existing strategic human capital at the hiring firm. Specifically, we find that while the co-mobility dimension has a negative impact on firm performance, the degree of expertise overlap is positively related to firm performance when it adds strategic human capital to an area where the hiring firm has little or no presence. Additionally, we find that expertise overlap positively impacts firm performance when the cluster hire involves low levels of co-mobility.",2018"Jiang, Hui; Zhang, Qing-Pu; Zhou, Yang",Dynamic Creative Interaction Networks and Team Creativity Evolution: A Longitudinal Study,JOURNAL OF CREATIVE BEHAVIOR,"To assess the dynamical effects of creative interaction networks on team creativity evolution, this paper elaborates a theoretical framework that links the key elements of creative interaction networks, including node, edge and network structure, to creativity in teams.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of organizational social capital in the design of management control systems and, more specifically, to better understand the functioning of clan control. We argue that adopting a social capital perspective can help explain how clan control works and what positive effects it has on performance: organizational social capital moderates the positive effect of clan control on performance and enables organizations to use clan control and bureaucratic controls complementarily.

In this cluster-randomized trial, we apply a decision-making perspective to compare a literacy intervention managed under a fidelity-focused approach, in which teachers were expected to implement researcher-designed procedures faithfully, versus a structured adaptive approach, in which teachers collaboratively planned program adaptations. In the short term, the adaptive approach increased teachers' accessing of intervention-related social capital, but decreased their accessing of social capital unrelated to the intervention. Short-term effects varied based on participants' role in the intervention. No group differences were found on social capital measures one year later, suggesting that the structured adaptive approach did not make teachers more likely to form ties that would be useful outside of the intervention.",2018"Teirlinck, Peter",Pathways for knowledge exchange in SMEs in software-driven knowledge-intensive business services,R & D MANAGEMENT,"This paper presents pathways for knowledge exchange as regards innovation in R&D-active SMEs in software-driven knowledge-intensive business services in a capital city environment.

Our operationalization of network data based on medieval Hansa Diets points to the complex association between tie weights (i.e., the strength of ties) and numbers of ties in network diffusion.

The association was stronger when the cross-cutting exposure came from weak ties, or acquaintances and strangers, and when the individuals were highly engaged with the cross-cutting news. Cross-cutting exposure from strong ties showed no significant relationship with political participation. It is suggested that cross-cutting exposure and political participation in the age of social media are different from those of the offline world, because they are supported by the norm of individual self-expression and take place in more anonymous and comfortable settings.

Once in a STEM field, academic and social integration has been long thought to be important for students' persistence. Yet, it is rarely investigated. In particular, the relative impact of in-class and out-of-class interactions remains an open issue. Here, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, for students whose grades fall in the ""middle of the pack,"" the out-of-class network is the most significant predictor of persistence. To do so, we use logistic regression combined with Akaike's information criterion to assess in and out-of-class networks, grades, and other factors. For students with grades at the very top (and bottom), final grade, unsurprisingly, is the best predictor of persistence-these students are likely already committed (or simply restricted from continuing) so they persist (or drop out). For intermediate grades, though, only out-of-class closeness-a measure of one's immersion in the network-helps predict persistence. This does not negate the need for in-class ties. However, it suggests that, in this cohort, only students that get past the convenient in-class interactions and start forming strong bonds outside of class are or become committed to their studies.

Existing research has neglected the differences in resource allocation types, by and large employed statistical analysis methods, and identified only the linear relationships among experimental variances of cross-sectional data. The present study differs from existing research in the following ways: First, we thoroughly consider the multi-faceted nature of resource allocation. Second, we use the method of multi-agent imitation according to perspective of dynamic system evolution and the principle of phase theory, allowing the explicitly analysis of nonlinear functional logic, forms and patterns in the variance. Finally, we analyze the appropriateness of different resource allocation models. Our paper features several significant findings: (1) The evolution of the knowledge flow network of a strategic alliance can produce a bifurcation phenomenon composed of saddle-node bifurcation and transcritical bifurcation. (2) The number of nodes exhibits a logarithmic growth distribution, the connection intensity and the network gain exhibit exponential growth distributions, and the connectivity and knowledge flow frequency are mutually influential in the form of a power function. (3) Knowledge-embedded resource allocation is most effective for improving the knowledge flow rate of networks and can further supply ample impetus for evolution. (4) Cooperation-oriented resource allocation is most beneficial for quickly propelling the network into the evolution realm. (5) Relationship-oriented resource allocation can aid the network in capturing more profit. Furthermore, this research is beneficial for understanding the key problems of each resource allocation model and the evolution of strategic alliance in knowledge flow networks. Our proposed methods and framework can be more widely applied to the fields of complex networks, knowledge management, and strategic innovation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The amount of time spent, frequency of getting news updates, and the frequency clicking on news-related links on social media were correlated with incidental exposure.

In this study, a general framework combining null models is proposed to quantify the impact of the topology, weight correlation and statistics on link prediction in weighted networks. Three null models for topology and weight distribution of weighted networks are presented. All the links of the original network can be divided into strong and weak ties. We can use null models to verify the strong effect of weak or strong ties. For two important statistics, we construct two null models to measure their impacts on link prediction. In our experiments, the proposed method is applied to seven empirical networks, which demonstrates that this model is universal and the impact of the topology and weight distribution of these networks in link prediction can be quantified by it. We find that in the USAir, the Celegans, the Gemo, the Lesmis and the CatCortex, the strong ties are easier to predict, but there are a few networks whose weak edges can be predicted more easily, such as the Netscience and the CScientists. It is also found that the weak ties contribute more to link prediction in the USAir, the NetScience and the CScientists, that is, the strong effect of weak ties exists in these networks.

We focus on a setting where consumers have multiple learning experiences using opinions from both uni- and bidirectional network ties. This allows us to investigate the impact of learning from both weak and strong ties. We find that, with sufficient experience, having more ties may lead to better decisions. However, the dynamic effects are dependent on the strength of the tie. Additional strong ties (operationalized as bidirectional links) lead to immediate positive effects on decision quality. However, additional weak ties (unidirectional, follower relationships) initially lead to lower decision quality. We find beneficial learning effects, however: adding more weak ties improves decision quality once one has sufficient experience in the community. Indeed, more-experienced consumers receive, ultimately, higher positive effects on decision quality from weak ties compared with strong ties. We interpret this as demonstrating that one needs to learn the norms of a new community before using the available information to improve decisions.",2018"Sommer, Elena; Gamper, Markus",Transnational entrepreneurial activities: A qualitative network study of self-employed migrants from the former Soviet Union in Germany,SOCIAL NETWORKS,"During their careers, migrant entrepreneurs may get involved in different types of transnational entrepreneurial activities and use their social capital to activate transnational business-related ties.

The study demonstrates that different types of social capital are mobilised for different types of transnational business strategies, with intensive transnational entrepreneurial activities requiring larger pre-existing networks in the country of origin of both strong and weak ties, that are gradually extended, while a more limited set of mostly informal weak ties suffice for more sporadic transnational activities in the country of origin.

The disease costs of sociality have largely been understood through the link between group size and transmission. However, infectious disease spread is driven primarily by the social organization of interactions in a group and not its size. 2. We used statistical models to review the social network organization of 47 species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and insects by categorizing each species into one of three social systems, relatively solitary, gregarious and socially hierarchical. Additionally, using computational experiments of infection spread, we determined the disease costs of each social system. 3. We find that relatively solitary species have large variation in number of social partners, that socially hierarchical species are the least clustered in their interactions, and that social networks of gregarious species tend to be the most fragmented. However, these structural differences are primarily driven by weak connections, which suggest that different social systems have evolved unique strategies to organize weak ties. 4. Our synthetic disease experiments reveal that social network organization can mitigate the disease costs of group living for socially hierarchical species when the pathogen is highly transmissible. In contrast, highly transmissible pathogens cause frequent and prolonged epidemic outbreaks in gregarious species.\ 5. We evaluate the implications of network organization across social systems despite methodological challenges, and our findings offer new perspective on the debate about the disease costs of group living.

In line with previous research on support networks, we find a strong reliance on strong ties in providing instrumental and emotional support (e.g., Wellman and Wortley, 1990) but also that distance matters (e.g., Mok et al., 2010) and shapes the network mobilisation strategies of the working mothers. Locally based weak ties, based on various forms of reciprocity, are supplemental in providing ad-hoc crisis support when transnational ties cannot be mobilized.

Because resource scarcity experienced by members of immigrant communities is likely to disrupt normatively expected reciprocal support, we explored multi-level predictors of exchange processes with personal network members that involve (1) only receiving support, (2) only providing support, and (3) reciprocal support exchanges. We focus on an understudied case of Central Asian migrant women in the Russian Federation using a sample of 607 women from three ethnic groups Kyrgyz, Tajik, Uzbek who were surveyed in two large Russian cities-Nizhny Novgorod and Kazan. The survey collected information on respondents' demographic, socioeconomic, and migration-related characteristics, as well as characteristics of up to five individuals with whom they had a close relationship. Multi-level multinomial regression analyses were used to account for the nested nature of the data. Our results revealed that closer social relationships (siblings and friends) and greater levels of resources (income and regularized legal status) at both ego and alter levels were positively related to providing, receiving, and reciprocally exchanging financial and emotional support. Egos were more likely to provide financial assistance to transnational alters, whereas they were more likely to engage in mutual exchanges of emotional support with their network members from other countries. Personal network size and density showed no relationship with support exchanges. These findings provide a nuanced picture of close personal ties as conduits for financial and emotional support in migrant communities in a major, yet understudied, migrant-receiving context.

An attention-based view of innovation in social networks,STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,"Research Summary: This study introduces the notion of attention allocation in networks to argue that individuals with different types of network structure produce good ideas via different pathways. Using survey data on communication networks at a software company, we find that people with highly constrained networks generate good ideas by following a logic of interrogation, by which they focus their attention on information from a particular contact. Conversely, individuals with less constrained networks produce good ideas by following a logic of recombination, whereby they divide their attention to information coming from across multiple contacts. The results show that in highly constrained networks, interrogation is a more reliable pathway to good ideas than recombination. We discuss the implications of these findings for behavioral strategy, social networks, and innovation. Managerial Summary: People can develop good ideas when they recombine diverse information inputs shared by non-redundant communication partners that span multiple local clusters. But, in an organization, most individuals are embedded in constrained networks of people who know each other and thus typically receive redundant information from work colleagues. This study suggests that they can innovate via a different pathway: through interrogation.

We grapple with the question: How can decision-makers coherently conceptualize and measure seemingly intangible factors to sustain partnerships for the emergence of collective impact? We conducted an inductive process case study to address this question, analyzing data from documents, observations, and interviews of 24 philanthropy leaders and multiple stakeholders in a decades-long partnership involving Canada's largest private family foundation, government and community networks, and during which a ""collective impact project"" emerged in Quebec Province, Canada. The multidimensional proximity framework provided an analytical lens. During the first phase of the partnership studied, there was a lack of baseline measurement of largely qualitative factors-conceptualized as cognitive, social, and institutional proximity between stakeholders-which evaluations suggested were important for explaining which community networks successfully brought about desired outcomes. Non-measurement of these factors was a problem in providing evidence for sustained engagement of stakeholders, such as government and local businesses. We develop a multidimensional proximity model that coherently conceptualizes qualitative proximity factors, for measuring their change over time.",2018"Keipi, Teo",Relatedness Online: An Analysis of Youth Narratives Concerning the Effects of Internet Anonymity,YOUNG,"This article explores youth narratives concerning the effects of internet anonymity on social ties online. Using an essay-based study of 78 youth (mean age 15.5 years), the effects of internet anonymity on relationships were examined. Results of the qualitative thematic approach showed that anonymity online has led to new forms of relational risk, stemming from misplaced trust or deception. Anonymity was also seen as lessening barriers to relational intimacy, as weak ties could transition to strong ties based on shared interests or social validation. Anonymity was also viewed as enhancing interactive courage and self-expression. Harassment and other negative behaviours were strengthened through anonymity. The dynamics between strong and weak ties were central to risks; here, social tie deception was found to cause harm where an aggressor feigned strong ties in the pursuit of instrumental gain. The findings point to the prominence of the online social effects youth attribute to anonymity.",2018"Cao, Xiongfei; Ali, Ahsan",Enhancing team creative performance through social media and transactive memory system,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,"Effective teamwork, knowledge coordination, and knowledge creation are recognized as essential sources of team effectiveness and creativity in modern organizations. Nowadays, social media is significantly modifying the patterns in the use of technology to support knowledge management practices in teams. At the same time, the literature shows that transactive memory system (TMS), which refers to how team members share their distributed knowledge and expertise, is an important factor affecting team performance. However, minimal effort has been made to elaborate on the precise role of social media in supporting TMS for enhancing absorptive capacity (ACAP) and knowledge creation capability (KCC) of the team, which in turn might influence team creative performance (TCP). Therefore, to address this gap in the literature, a theoretical model is developed and validated. Survey data collected from 334 members of 68 knowledge work teams indicated that social media use at work has a positive relationship with TMS and both social media use at work and TMS are positively related to ACAP and KCC of the team. Results further indicated that ACAP positively influenced KCC, and both have a direct relationship with TCP. This study shows that careful investment in social media by an organization can enhance meta-knowledge of ""who knows what"" within teams. Finally, exploring external knowledge alone is not enough. Instead, organizations must ensure external knowledge is utilized to create new knowledge to improve TCP.",2018"Fan, Rui; Xu, Ke; Zhao, Jichang",An agent-based model for emotion contagion and competition in online social media,PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS,"Recent studies suggest that human emotions diffuse in not only real-world communities but also online social media. However, a comprehensive model that considers up-todate findings and multiple online social media mechanisms is still missing. To bridge this vital gap, an agent-based model, which concurrently considers emotion influence and tie strength preferences, is presented to simulate the emotion contagion and competition. Our model well reproduces patterns observed in the empirical data, like anger's preference on weak ties, anger-dominated users' high vitalities and angry tweets' short retweet intervals, and anger's competitiveness in negative events. The comparison with a previously presented baseline model further demonstrates its effectiveness in modeling online emotion contagion. It is also surprisingly revealed by our model that as the ratio of anger approaches joy with a gap less than 12%, anger will eventually dominate the online social media and arrives the collective outrage in the cyber space. The critical gap disclosed here can be indeed warning signals at early stages for outrage control. Our model would shed lights on the study of multiple issues regarding emotion contagion and competition in terms of computer simulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the combination of social networks and media technology does not mean that an exchange of knowledge will occur. Users are the critical components of an online Q&A community, and their active participation is critical for its development. Thus, it is crucial to figure out factors impacting users' motivation to participate in community activities, especially knowledge contribution. In this study, we focus on user behavior regarding knowledge contribution in social Q&A communities, and differentiate users' initial participation behavior from continued participation behavior. We collect users' activity data from a well-known Chinese social Q&A community, and the results show that identity-based trust, feedback from previous knowledge contribution, opportunities of social exposure, word-of-mouth marketing, and pressure from norms of reciprocity have a positive impact on users' continued knowledge contribution behavior.

The findings suggest that both transport and leisure/exercise walking are more frequent within master-planned communities (MPC) as opposed to conventional suburbs. The main reasons for this are the proximity of destinations, the provision of aesthetically attractive areas, and residents' feelings of being safe from crime and risk of injury within MPCs. The research reveals that walking within MPCs significantly contributes to more frequent social interactions and the establishment of weak and absent ties among older age residents.",2018"Evans, M.

P.",Organisational Information and Knowledge Sharing: Uncovering Mediating Effects of Perceived Trustworthiness Using the PROCESS Approach,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,"Many organisations are confronted with challenges in getting employees to effectively participate in information and knowledge sharing (IKS). Further, IKS is embedded in multifaceted social contexts, which are influenced by several different social and cognitive factors. This study is in support of the hypothesis that perceived trustworthiness is widely implicated as a mediating factor between those social-cognitive factors and IKS. Previous work, however, uncovered only a handful of such mediating effects. It is argued here that the paucity may have been due to limitations of the statistical methods. This study employs PROCESS, a more powerful current method for mediation analysis in an attempt to uncover previously hidden relationships. Analyses were performed on data collected from 275 knowledge workers (legal professionals and paralegals) engaged in shared legal project work, at one of Canadas largest multijurisdictional law firms. Social-cognitive factors that were considered were shared language, shared vision, tie strength, age/gender/educational homophily and relationship length. IKS outcomes were willingness to share, willingness to use and perceived receipt of useful information/knowledge. Consistent with the hypothesis, the more powerful method revealed a large number of significant mediating effects of perceived trustworthiness. Out of possible 112 simple mediation models, 62 were significant, 44 of which had been previously undiscovered. The results highlight the importance of trust as well as the power of current methods for mediation analysis and serve as a strong argument for their use.

Emerging research on exposure to diverse informational resources (e.g., ideas and knowledge), however, has painted a more complex picture regarding its effect on individuals' creative performance. This research examines the effects of culturally diverse networks on the flow of ideas and individuals' creativity. Combining social network analysis with experimental methods, two studies using different samples found that a culturally diverse network increases the likelihood of receiving culture-related novel ideas (but not other types of novel ideas) from network contacts, whether or not these contacts share one's own culture of origin. Additionally, the creativity effect of network diversity depends on the type of tasks. Networks' degree of cultural diversity increases creativity on tasks that draw on varied cultural-knowledge resources but not on other types of tasks. These findings highlight that network diversity provides access to specific forms of knowledge and has a domain-specific effect on creativity.

Moreover, the knowledge based view (KBV) has long suggested that due to stronger cognitive links within firms, internal compared to external service provision creates better conditions for knowledge sharing. Empirical evidence for this claim is however scarce, and the KBV does not explain the mechanisms for more knowledge sharing in internal sourcing in detail. Moreover, there is now some evidence to suggest that firms' relationships with external sourcing partners are becoming more similar to those with captive centres, which represent a less traditional form of insourcing setting. To scrutinize the possible knowledge sharing advantages of internal sourcing in more depth, we turn to social capital (SC) research. There are some theoretical claims that SC and knowledge sharing are stronger within than between firms, and there is ample evidence that SC facilitates knowledge sharing. Our survey results suggest that the extent of knowledge sharing and SC are indeed stronger in a captive than in an external sourcing mode, and that structural (tie strength), cognitive (shared understanding), and relational (trust) aspects of SC mediate the effect of sourcing mode on the extent of knowledge sharing. By contrast, network stability (a structural aspect) mediated knowledge sharing only indirectly, by reinforcing the other SC aspects. We highlight important contributions to research and practice of IS outsourcing and social capital. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It aims to add new fieldwork results and interpretations to the lacuna of studies on the interrelations between faith and migration. Most publications show the specificity of Roma economic activities in the context of their migratory movements, but the role of religious network and its social commitment is a less analysed issue. Roma migrants have different religious profile and are Orthodox Christians, Muslims, or Evangelical Christians. Bearing in mind the religious landscapes in Bulgaria and Spain, which are predominantly Orthodox or Catholic, respectively, all migrant workers have left from an Orthodox home country and settled in a Catholic destination country. The text examines Roma mobility from the early 1990s until today. While settling in Spain, Roma/Gypsies present themselves to Spanish people as Bulgarians' and they are often recognised by them in this way. In the period prior to Bulgaria's accession to the European Union in 2007 most Roma migrants had no residence or work permits or neither. In some cases, they benefited from the services of the ""Caritas' Catholic organisation. However, they are not influenced by Catholicism as a faith and have only pragmatic aims in using its services. In this dynamic context, the social ties created on the basis of joining a particular religious community acquire importance for Evangelical believers, unlike the Orthodox Christians and the Muslims who rely on their family contacts mostly. Evangelical networks have a double accumulation effect and the believers employ both bridging and bonding social ties in producing their religious and social commitment. However, the social potential of the Evangelical networks is not fully used by Roma migrants in Spain.",2018"Crescenzi, Riccardo; Di Cataldo, Marco; Faggian, Alessandra","Internationalized at work and localistic at home: The ""split' Europeanization behind Brexit",PAPERS IN REGIONAL SCIENCE,This paper looks at the results of the referendum on the United Kingdom membership to the European Union in order to test the link between the internationalization of the local economy and the openness of the local society as factors associated with the Leave vote (Brexit). The paper compares a number of alternative explanations put forward in the public debate after the referendum. The empirical analysis suggests that the outcome of the referendum can be linked to an increasing tension between the ever increasing internationalization of local firms and the localistic' attitude of their employees.

In the US, there is a presumption of an open labor market in which potential employees compete on the basis of their qualifications, where the fairness of decisions is guided by anti-discrimination laws and normative organizational policies. In China, although there is a history of close relationships that guide the exchange of favors, following the 1949 revolution, Communist Party leaders were given the authority to allocate positions in ways that were supposed to eliminate special privileges of class and background. Yet recent research has suggested that social connections are an important part of getting a job in both the US and China for two-thirds to three-quarters of job seekers. In the US context, such connections are described as social capital. In the Chinese context, connections are defined as guanxi.

The paper argues that strong ties and weak ties play major roles in the process of opinion leadership that prior studies have insufficiently differentiated due to methodological limitations. Against this background, a methodologically more rigorous reassessment of the association between tie strength and opinion leadership is conducted. The reassessment centers on the combination of ego-centered network analyses with statistical methods of multilevel analysis. These are applied to original data of a study by Schenk (2006) on financial opinion leadership in Germany (naEuro<overline>= 10,100 survey respondents) which has previously been considered as an important indication for tie strength's minor importance. Empirical results show that strong ties and weak ties are remarkably more important in the process of opinion leadership than previously known. Opinion leaders benefit from strong ties, because personal influence can be carried through them comparatively easily. By contrast, weak ties foster opinion leadership in a structural manner by catalyzing the influence that opinion leaders can exert through strong ties.",2018"Paerregaard, Karsten","Capitalizing on migration: The role of strong and weak ties among Peruvian entrepreneurs in the United States, Spain and Chile",MIGRATION STUDIES,"How do Peruvian migrants use ethnic entrepreneurship to make headway in their countries of settlement?

The finding is that Peruvian restaurant owners are adept in converting their educational skills and previous work experiences into human capital but that they often lack financial and cultural capital to establish new enterprises. Another insight is that while most Peruvian entrepreneurs use bonding capital to access these resources not all command enough bridging capital to capture customers outside their family and ethnic networks, which is critical to compete on the ethnic restaurant market. A final topic of inspection is the receiving contexts and the opportunity structures in the three countries and the way they facilitate or restrain immigrant entrepreneurships.

Studies show that close relationships with teachers especially benefit socioeconomically disadvantaged adolescents, yet little is known about teacher-mentors' perspectives on mentorship. This study draws on in-depth interviews with teachers in low-income high schools and ethnographic observations to examine the dynamics that sustain student-teacher mentoring relationships. I engage social exchange frameworks to show that reciprocal exchanges that generated intangible rewards for teachers, such as gratitude and purpose, helped maintain mentorships. I find that teachers' motivations to invest in students were contingent on the strength of the relationship. Teachers withdrew assistance when they perceived that relationships became nonreciprocal. The context in which teachers interacted with mentees and the form of support they had given also influenced their evaluations of reciprocity. These findings contribute to a growing body of literature on relationships that challenge strict divisions between the function of strong and weak ties. Further, these findings contribute to social capital literature by showing that once accessed, social capital does not lie latent as network ties maintain the same willingness to help.

By doing so, we bring salience to the existence of intermediate ties (i.e., the ties of moderate strength) and their implications for value creation. Even though the intermediate ties are likely most common in the buyer-supplier context, they have been given short shrift in the literature. We predict a U-shaped relation, where weak ties and strong ties are more effective than intermediate ties in value creation. Furthermore, we explore the moderating role of dependence asymmetry. Our hypotheses are tested using survey data from a major global automaker and its North American suppliers. The results demonstrate that both the weak and strong buyer-supplier ties lead to higher value creation, whereas intermediate ties do not increase value creation.

Social media were marginal to the emergence of this civil disobedience movement, yet a common view is that digital technology's weak ties are an integral part of large-scale collective action in the digital era. Instead, strong offline ties with structured organizations were critical to its emergence. Qualitative data show that a network of structured organizations, grassroots organizing, traditional media, and an ideological response to an economic and political crisis worked together to propel this large-scale movement. In effect, both structural and cultural factors shaped the activism in this case, not individual or digital explanations. Consequently, this article also traces the historic phases of social movement theory, situating a digital emphasis as part of an evolving focus on social movement origin mechanisms. Emergence scholarship on digital activism would benefit from expanding the entry point of protest earlier and broader than a hashtag's debut, as digital explanations may not be as distinct of a theoretical construct as previous research suggests.",2018"Hoppitt, William J. E.; Farine, Damien R.",Association indices for quantifying social relationships: how to deal with missing observations of individuals or groups,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Social network analysis has provided important insight into many population processes in wild animals. Constructing social networks requires quantifying the relationship between each pair of individuals in the population. Researchers often use association indices to convert observations into a measure of propensity for individuals to be seen together. At its simplest, this measure is just the probability of observing both individuals together given that one has been seen (the simple ratio index). However, this probability becomes more challenging to calculate if the detection rate for individuals is imperfect. We first evaluate the performance of existing association indices at estimating true association rates under scenarios where (1) only a proportion of all groups are observed (group location errors), (2) not all individuals are observed despite being present (individual location errors), and (3) a combination of the two. Commonly used methods aimed at dealing with incomplete observations perform poorly because they are based on arbitrary observation probabilities. We therefore derive complete indices that can be calibrated for the different types of incomplete observations to generate accurate estimates of association rates. These are provided in an R package that readily interfaces with existing routines. We conclude that using calibration data is an important step when constructing animal social networks, and that in their absence, researchers should use a simple estimator and explicitly consider the impact of this on their findings.

Specifically, this research examines and compares the effects of clan and bureaucratic control on the accessibility of tacit versus codified knowledge. The researchers propose that individuals who perceive greater clan control, or governance through common values and beliefs, will perceive greater accessibility of both tacit and codified knowledge; while individuals who perceive greater bureaucratic control, or governance through rules and procedures, will perceive increase in codified knowledge only. To test the role of alignment between control systems and knowledge types in affecting knowledge accessibility, a questionnaire was administered to all engineers located in North America (855 people) within one engineering organization, and data collected from 298 responses were analyzed using linear regression analysis.

Some others have investigated knowledge management among open-source-software (OSS) developers and discussed factors influencing knowledge transfer within development teams (e.g. Joshi and Sarker, 2006). In the domain of open source software (OSS) communities, more companies are now attempting to establish relationships to benefit from these potential value-creating communities; and project managers could in fact target different goals within software development teams including knowledge transfer within and between teams. We step forward to distinguish knowledge transfer within groups as opposed to knowledge transfer between groups; where relevant projects are bundled into separate strongly intra-connected groups. In knowledge management literature there is a trade-off between sparse network structures (Burt, 2000, 2002) versus dense network structures (Walker et al., 1997; Coleman, 1988). It is argued that the former facilitates the diffusion and generation of ideas among groups, while the latter affects the implementation of idea within each dense group. To our best knowledge, there has been no study to investigate the relationship between dense and sparse network structures. We propose that knowledge transfer within dense groups has a positive influence on knowledge transfer between sparse groups, in that intragroup density, group size, developers centrality and betweenness could impact intergroup coupling. To prove our hypothesis, we use a complex network of open source software (OSS) as the domain of interest, where developers represent nodes and two developers contributing to a project task represent a network tie. Developers contributing to tasks in groups other than their own can explore novel ideas via sharing knowledge, whereas developers contributing to tasks inside groups exploit ideas to improve those projects. We investigate the idea both analytically and empirically within 4 months, 8 months and 1 year lagged time, and finally show that intragroup density has a positive whereas developers' centrality has a negative influence on intergroup coupling.",2018"Wei, Pengxu; Bao, Ruixue; Lv, Zeping; Jing, Bin",Weak but Critical Links between Primary Somatosensory Centers and Motor Cortex during Movement,FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE,"Motor performance is improved by stimulation of the agonist muscle during movement. However, related brain mechanisms remain unknown. In this work, we perform a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 21 healthy subjects under three different conditions: (1) movement of right ankle alone; (2) movement and simultaneous stimulation of the agonist muscle; or (3) movement and simultaneous stimulation of a control area. We constructed weighted brain networks for each condition by using functional connectivity. Network features were analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. We found that: (1) the second condition evokes the strongest and most widespread brain activations (5147 vs. 4419 and 2320 activated voxels); and (2) this condition also induces a unique network layout and changes hubs and the modular structure of the brain motor network by activating the most ""silent"" links between primary somatosensory centers and the motor cortex, particularly weak links from the thalamus to the left primary motor cortex (M1). Significant statistical differences were found when the strength values of the right cerebellum (P < 0.001) or the left thalamus (P = 0.006) were compared among the three conditions. Over the years, studies reported a small number of projections from the thalamus to the motor cortex. This is the first work to present functions of these pathways. These findings reveal mechanisms for enhancing motor function with somatosensory stimulation, and suggest that network function cannot be thoroughly understood when weak ties are disregarded.",2018"Gausdal, Anne H.",MANAGING TRUST -BUILDING IN PUBLIC-PRIVATE STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,MANAGING TRUST IN STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,"Building interpartner trust in strategic alliances is one of the key challenges in managing such alliances in general and, because of different goals, governance systems, logics and language, in public-private alliances in particular. Interpartner trust develops through the mechanisms of trust transfer and trust conversion, and managing both is an important management issue. The research question to be answered in this chapter is, How to manage trust building processes and methods in public-private strategic alliances? The five processes of connection, communication, direction, temporary groups, and resource-sharing are found to build trust in interpartner contexts. Moreover, the processes of connection, communication, and temporary groups are found to contribute to the mechanism of mist transfer, while the process of direction appears to contribute to the mechanism of trust conversion. Although the process of resource-sharing is found to contribute mostly to the mechanism of trust transfer, when the managers get their employees to share resources with their alliance partners, this process may also contribute to trust conversion. Moreover, managing these processes consciously constitutes top down processes that contribute to trust conversion. This chapter discusses in depth these five trust-building processes both theoretically and practically, and develops an outline of how the processes might be managed in practice. Furthermore, several methods or tools that entail one or more of the trust building processes are presented; and four cases from public private settings further illustrate how the processes and methods can be used, or not used, in practice. The findings show that applying and managing the trust-building processes and methods has a positive influence on trust-building in public private alliances.",2018"Parnell, Daniel; Widdop, Paul; Groom, Ryan; Bond, Alex",The emergence of the sporting director role in football and the potential of social network theory in future research,MANAGING SPORT AND LEISURE,"The commodified and highly competitive nature of professional football (soccer) has increased the professionalisation of organisational structures and management practices within clubs that enhance their competitive advantages within the labour market. This is a direct result of the financial rewards for success, and the potential cost of failure is significant. The utilisation of the Sporting Director position represents one strategy for organisations to improve both on and off-field performance success through maintaining organisational influence and control. Yet, the role is accompanied by a range of conceptual and operational misunderstandings. This commentary aims to examine the emergence of the Sporting Director and to offer some guidance on potential avenues for future research. Specifically, we consider, how social network theory might provide a theoretical framework to understand the role of the Sporting Director in practice better. To achieve this, this commentary is structured into five sections. First, we outline the role of corporate governance, senior executives and board membership, within organisational studies and the applicability of this for professional football. Second, we offer a contextual analysis of the business of professional football in Europe, and in particular its move towards globalisation and commodification. Third, we provide a current review of the Sporting Director role in professional football. Fourth, we explain the value of thinking relationally, using a social network approach, to better understanding the role of the Sporting Director within the global context. Finally, we offer some concluding thoughts and considerations surrounding the adoption of the Sporting Director role in England, and outline some potential research agendas concerning social network theory, and related concepts such as embeddedness, structural holes and the strength of weak ties.",2018"Kaushik, Pawandeep; Chowdhury, Ataharul; Odame, Helen Hambly; van Paassen, Annemarie","Social Media for Enhancing Stakeholders' Innovation Networks in Ontario, Canada",JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & FOOD INFORMATION,"This case study assessed local food stakeholders' use of Facebook and Twitter to support interaction and build their networks of innovation in Ontario.

Findings revealed that stakeholders could be more innovative in their use of social media, but they would be unlikely to do so, without tapping into beneficial interactions of weak ties, as well as fostering strong ties.

Predicting and recommending links has been mainly addressed to date as an accuracy-targeting problem. In this paper we put forward a different perspective, considering that correctly predicted links may not be all equally valuable. Contact recommendation brings an opportunity to drive the structural evolution of a social network towards desirable properties of the network as a whole, beyond the sum of the isolated gains for the individual users to whom recommendations are delivered - global properties that we may want to assess and promote as explicit recommendation targets. In this perspective, we research the definition of relevant diversity metrics drawing from social network analysis concepts, and linking to prior diversity notions in recommender systems. In particular, we elaborate on the notion of weak tie recommendation as a means to enhance the structural diversity of networks. In order to show the signification of the proposed metrics, we report experiments with Twitter data illustrating how state of the art contact recommendation methods compare in terms of our metrics; we examine the tradeoff with accuracy, and we show that diverse link recommendations result in a corresponding diversity enhancement in the flow of information through the network, with potential implications in mitigating filter bubbles.",2018Hu Qinfang; Li Xiang,Research on the Influence Mechanism of Cognitive Distance and Social Distance Between Supply Chain Enterprises on the Performance of Cooperative Innovation Projects,"PROCEEDINGS OF 2018 CHINA MARKETING INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE: SMART MARKETING: HUMAN, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION",,2018"Ghaffar, Faisal; Buda, Teodora Sandra; Assem, Haytham; Afsharinejad, Armita; Hurley, Neil",A framework for enterprise social network assessment and weak ties recommendation,2018 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM),"Sociological theories of career success provide fundamental principles for the analysis of social links to identify patterns that facilitate career development. Some theories (e.g. Granovetter's Strength of Weak Ties Theory and Burt's Structural Hole Theory) have shown that certain types of social ties provide career advantage to individuals by facilitating them to access unique information and connecting them with a diverse range of others in different social cliques. The assessment of link types and prediction of new links in the external social networks such as Facebook and Twitter have been studied extensively. However, this has not been addressed in the enterprise social networks and especially the prediction of weak ties in the context of employee career development. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing an Enterprise Weak Ties Recommendation (EWTR) framework which leverages enterprise social networks, employee collaboration activity streams and the organizational chart. We formulate weak ties recommendation as a link prediction problem. However, unlike any generic link prediction work, we first validated explicit enterprise social network with a set of heterogeneous collaboration networks and show assessment improves the explicit network's effectiveness in predicting new links. Furthermore, we leverage assessed social network for the weak ties prediction by optimizing the link prediction methods using organizational chart information. We demonstrate that optimization improves prediction accuracy in terms of AUC and average precision and our characterization of weak ties to a certain extent aligns with Granovetter's and Burt's seminal studies.",2018"Quadri, Christian; Zignani, Matteo; Gaito, Sabrina; Rossi, Gian Paolo",Feature-rich Ego-network Circles in Mobile Phone Graphs: Tie Multiplexity and the Role of Alters,2018 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM),"A well-known result in social science states that, although people maintain a large number of social relationships, in practice, their interactions are concentrated mostly on a small portion of their neighbors. According to Dunbar's hypothesis, this phenomenon is due to a limited human cognitive capacity to handle too many social relationships, together with a few time for socializing. These constraints result in an organization of people's ego-network into four or five groups depending on the strength of the interactions, the so called Dunbar's circles. The verification of the Dunbar's hypothesis, the identification of social circles and their characterization are still open questions, although researchers have found evidence of its validity on different social networks, from small offline networks to online social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook. In addition, little is known about the semantic aspects of the circles, i.e. who are the members of each circle. In this paper, we cope with these issues by analyzing a mobile phone graph where people's interactions are expressed by both voice calls and text messages. We firstly compare two methods for the identification of the circles, which rely on the different definitions of strength proposed in literature. Both methods confirm the subdivision of ego-networks into four or five circles, each characterized by a specific interaction strength. Then, we validate the Dunbar's hypothesis and, by leveraging some powerful features of the mobile phone dataset in use, we provide a first semantic characterization of social circles. We show, for instance, that people maintain relationships with the members of the closest circles by combining calls and texts. In addition, by detecting home and work locations of each individual, we highlight that a semantic aspect, such as the role of the alters, impacts on the ego-network circles. In particular, family members and workmates are located in different circles: the former mainly form the closest circle, i.e. the support clique, while the latter are distributed among the outer circles.",2018"Zovko, Ivona Carapina; Sersic, Darja Maslic",AVAILABILITY OF SOCIAL CAPITAL UPON FIRST JOB SEARCH OF UNIVERSITY GRADUATES WITH DIFFERENT SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS,REVIJA ZA SOCIJALNU POLITIKU,"The aim of the research was to analyze socio-demographic predictors of social networks that university graduates can rely on while seeking their first employment - assessment of their size, strength of social connections and status of network participants. The network size is defined as an overall number of people an individual is connected with, and the network strength as a closeness of social relation between an individual and other persons in the network. Close friends and relatives are examples of strong ties, while rarely contacted acquaintances represent weak ties that are socially, economically and frequently physically distant. The status of a participant is operationalised as an educational, employment and economic status of those who form the individual's network. The research was conducted on a sample of 730 university graduates of public institutions of higher education in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The data were gathered through an online survey and are based on self-assessment. It has been determined that the individual's status predicts their assessment of their own social network: average salary is a positive independent predictor of the network's size, while average salary and fathers employment status are positive predictors of the network participant's status that university graduates can rely on while seeking their first employment. The researched socioeconomic characteristics of university graduates explain between 2.8% and 3.45% of variances due to individual differences in the experience of social capital.

Reliance on Strong Ties networking decreased respondents' broader range of US employment opportunities and further impeded their prospects of upward employment mobility. While the Philippine graduates' Strong Ties networking provided assistance and most specifically acted as intermediaries for gaining their initial employment, this type of networking had a significant impact resulting in poor labour market outcomes and rather imperfect long-term employment opportunities.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how aspiring entrepreneurs in a Danish rural area setting manage to get embedded into relevant business networks. Before the literature background on social capital and regional development, the authors use the embeddedness approach in explaining whether weak or strong ties are most beneficial to get the business started and how lacking strong ties can be compensated. Design/methodology/approach - This paper takes an economic sociology perspective on social capital and is empirically based on a case study. The sample consists of a group of young aspiring entrepreneurs, living in the rural area of Southern Jutland, who are all committed to an organization which supports regional start-ups. Findings - The authors found that aspiring entrepreneurs have different needs depending on their development status and type of innovation. Founders, who are developing or have developed new product innovations, seem to have an increased need for ""strong ties"" with consultants and those with knowledge about building up a professional network. Founders, who are developing or have developed a significantly improved service, have strong ties with former fellow students and researchers at the university. Originality/value - This study illustrates that aspiring entrepreneurs connected to a regional entrepreneurship center gained access to a wider relevant network. Depending on their level of embeddedness, they could build new strong relationships and exploit information stemming from new ""weak ties"" and as such harness more benefits. The study shows that less privileged start-ups can substitute strong ties, especially through the support of professional managers of startup-supporting organizations. Finally, a model explaining the impact of social capital on the entrepreneurial sphere of regional business networks and on its innovativeness is deduced.",2018"Sechi, Guido; Borri, Dino; De Lucia, Caterina; Celmins, Viesturs",Environmental learning in regions: a social capital based approach.

The quantitative analysis is carried out by means of a structural equation model based on data collected in the Republic of Latvia.

The paper inquires into the effects of these properties concluding that they influence two aspects that are highly relevant for territorial development: they facilitate the diffusion of information and they foster cooperation among actors.

We compare the content of the alphabet books published in limitrophe states with the content of the alphabet books published in Soviet Russia at the same time, so as to reveal the particular nature and instruments of socio-cultural transmission in the communities of Russian-speaking minorities who found themselves in the actual emigration. Conceptual framework of research consists of culture typology by M. Mead and recent studies of intergenerational cultural transmission and social cohesion. Source base of conducted research consisted off three primers published in 1920s in Latvia and one primer published in Poland. In addition we reviewed two primers published within the same time frame in Soviet Russia. Model of intergenerational transmission in the analyzed Latvian emigrant primers is based on a child's urge to individual development of values and guidelines, testing of behavioral practices, etc., using means recommended by adult community, i.e. knowledge and education. Therefore, Latvian primers ""allow"" children to be included in network of weak ties, thereby loosening in-group cohesion, but preparing children for integration into dominant culture. In the Polish edition of primer for Russian speaking children one can observe classic post figurative type of intergenerational cultural transmission. This ""permanence"" of conveyed values and illusion of stability homogenize community, both vertically and horizontally, and provide in-group cohesion, protecting the group as a cocoon from cultural diffusion and assimilation. In Polish textbooks this cohesion strategy is supported and strengthened by representation of external environment as hostile and in-group environment as stable, based on age-proven popular wisdom and support of superior, i.e. divine, essence. Content analysis of primers published in 1920s in Soviet Russia allows talking about reconstruction of postfigurative type of intergenerational cultural transmission. In the context of actual abruption of cultural continuity the strategy of extrapolation of intrafamilial model to the society at large is used here. It enables to normalize current social transformations and legitimates established social hierarchy.",2018"Sousa Farias, Rafael Araujo; Hoffmann, Valmir Emil",Analysis of scientific production on interorganizational networks study field,INNOVATION & MANAGEMENT REVIEW,"Purpose - The present study seeks to answer the following research question: what is the profile of the academic production related to the interorganizational networks in the period between 2006 and 2016? Thus, this study aims to characterize the academic production about the subject interorganizational networks available in national journals with Concept ""A"" (Qualis Capes), in the period between 2006 and 2016. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses national journals with Concept ""A"" of the Qualis classification (2016) for journal selection. In total, 12 ""A"" concept journals were identified. However, it was decided to analyze ten of them. The procedures suggested by Crossan and Apaydin (2010) for conducting bibliometric studies were adopted. It has been identified that 77 articles were published in eight journals. The R 3.3.2 and R Studio 1.0.136 software were used. The IGRAPH 0.5.5-2 extension (package) was used to analyze graphs and co-authorship networks (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006). This extension is able to manipulate networks with millions of vertices and edges and provides a series of functions to analyze the properties of social networks, such as subnetworks, intermediation, centrality, among other characteristics (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006). Correspondence analysis (CA) was also performed. CA is a multivariate exploratory technique that converts a data matrix into a graphical representation, so that rows and columns are represented by points in a graph (Greenacre and Hastie, 1987). This extension is dedicated to the multivariate analysis of data and allows the manipulation of different types of variables (quantitative or categorical). In the present research, multiple CA (MCA) was applied - indicated when the elements are described as categorical variables (Le et al., 2008). The characteristics considered for carrying out MCA were the ""main term"", ""research approach"", ""type of research"", ""constructs"" and ""research strategies"". By using the FactoMineR 1.34 extension, the hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC) function was used (Husson et al., 2007; Le et al., 2008). This function allows creating clusters from the characteristics of the articles analyzed and highlights the justifications for the groupings created. The function allows forming as many clusters the researcher wishes, being of its attribution to analyze a division that best represents the characteristics of the data (Husson, Josse, and Pages, 2010). Husson et al. (2010) suggest that an analysis should be performed from the hierarchical tree, thus the number of clusters can be defined considering the overall appearance (or shape) of the tree formed. At last, a word cloud was created using the Wordcloud 2.5 extension (Fellows, 2013). The noticed advantage of using this extension is that it does not separate the terms that form a keyword when generating the cloud. It has been used for the keywords of the 77 articles analyzed; however, it has been decided to keep those that presented frequency greater than or equal to two. By avoiding occasional terms, a more intelligible cloud was obtained. Findings - The present study was not able to verify if the journals analyzed by Andrighi et al. (2011) have influenced others to publish on the subject, as suggested by the Bradford's Law. The standard ""success breeds success"", suggested by the Bradford's Law, was not confirmed. The so-called nuclear zone (Brookes, 1969; Novaretti et al., 2015) is composed of the journals Brazilian Administration Review (BAR), Revista de Administracao Contemporanea (RAC), Revista de Administracao Publica (RAP) and Revista Brasileira de Gestao de Negocios (RBGN). The journal RAC stands out for having been the one that has increased its annual average of publication in relation to the theme, when compared with the findings of Andrighi et al. (2011). The journals BAR and RBGN stand out because they are in the nuclear zone, even though they were not considered in the work of Andrighi et al. (2011). It should be noted that all the analyzed journals have in common the fact of addressing the themes of management and administration and, more specifically, making room for the ""competitiveness"" and ""cooperation"" constructs. These constructs are related to the theme of networks and were the most recurrent in the articles analyzed. ""Cooperation"" (29), ""competitiveness"" (27), ""knowledge"" (12), ""learning"" (6) and ""trust"" (3) were the ""constructs"" used to compose the 77 articles analyzed. In turn, ""network"" (49), ""alliance"" (18) and ""cluster"" (9) were the ""main term"" most used in the articles. This implies that the topic of cooperation is more linked to a vision of strategy. As occurred in the research of Andrighi et al. (2011), the term ""network"" is the most recurrent; in addition, the growth of space obtained by the term ""alliance"" stands out. The terms ""network"" and ""alliance"" were the most used by the articles, being predominant in 87 per cent of the research. In the present research, the predominance of the term ""network"" may have occurred because its concept is broader and it is used in the literature in different ways, even in contradictory ways (Andrighi et al., 2011; Schommer, 2001). In turn, the term ""alliance"" may have been recurrent because it has a wide dispersion of published issues, such as governance structure, cooperation, knowledge transfer and trust (Lima and Campos Filho, 2009). By using the HCPC function of the FactoMineR extension, the articles were grouped according to their characteristics, and then three clusters were formed. By analyzing the generated results, it is assumed that the division into three clusters was the one that best represented the data. Cluster 1 is characterized by descriptive, quantitative, half documentary and half survey research studies, being ""cluster"" the main term. Cluster 2 is characterized by exploratory case studies with qualitative-quantitative analyzes. Cluster 3 is characterized by theoretical tests. The Zipf's law points out that a small group of words occurs many times; however, when considering the most recurrent words Networks (9), Strategic Alliances (8), Cooperation (8), Interorganizational Networks (8) and Alliances (6) show that they were present in only about 10 per cent of the works. Lotka's Law, which states that few authors publish much and many authors publish little, was not confirmed. The authors who presented the highest number of publications, T. Diana L. v. A. de Macedo-Soares (6); Jorge Renato Verschoore (6); Alsones Balestrin (5); Douglas Wegner (4); Humberto Elias Garcia Lopes (4), participated in less than 10 per cent of the works. Thus, the authorship was characterized by many researchers publishing few works, what can be an effect of the behavior of these authors, who prefer to publish in network. The centrality of the relations between the authors was analyzed and, in addition, the intermediation points of the network were identified. The present study also analyzed all the references used by the 77 articles that compose the study. The main author of each of the references used was identified. Among the 30 identified authors, Yin and Hair Jr. stand out for books related to fundamentals and research methodologies. Borgatti and Eisenhardt developed research on the topic of interorganizational networks and also created works for methodological foundations. Powell was the most frequently mentioned author (28) and had more different works referenced (9). Powell stands out for the production of articles published in periodicals, not books. Porter's situation is the opposite. Most of the quotations made to the author come from his books, especially the work ""Competitive strategy"" (Porter, 1980). All authors identified are foreigners, with the exception of Balestrin. Marshall, Polanyi, Granovetter and Williamson are authors of works considered seminal, being them, respectively, ""Principles of economics"" (Marshall, 1890), ""Personal knowledge: towards a post critical philosophy"" (Polanyi, 1958) and ""The strength of weak ties"" (Granovetter, 1973) and ""Markets and hierarchies, analysis and antitrust implications"" (Williamson, 1975). Research limitations/implications - Like all research, it has limitations. The first one derives from the selection criteria of the periodicals to be analyzed. The cut referring to the journals of greater impact excludes most of the national articles. These studies may contain important contributions to the knowledge of the national publication profile. In addition, the choice to analyze the journals disregards other types of work, such as books, scientific events, dissertations and thesis and reports. The choice of articles published in journals is based on the fact that these are a ""certified knowledge"", as the studies are peer-reviewed, and in the case of the Qualis ""A"" stratum, a review of exogenous quality is supposed on this production. Despite its flaws, this system can be considered reliable to evaluate scientific knowledge (Bedeian, 2004; Shugan, 2007). The analysis of the most recent articles may have been hampered by a temporal issue. In addition, the choice of keywords, a necessary step, leaves out other studies. Another limitation refers to the fact that the articles have been analyzed and classified by the authors, which presupposes the use of their value judgments, at least to some extent. Other limitations refer to the bibliometric techniques employed. The main authors referenced in the studies were demonstrated, that is, those authors who have been used as a theoretical reference for studies of interorganizational networks. However, the circumstances under which these citations occurred were not analyzed. For example, an author may be quoted to use the contribution of his/her study, to be criticized or just to be another reference in the text. The lack of this analysis can be considered a fragility of the study. Practical implications - This text was started talking about the dispersion of the studies on networks in the country. Previous work has been used, theoretically and empirically demonstrating this fact. Zipf's Law applied to bibliometrics, as described by Guedes and Borschiver (2005), Novaretti et al. (2015) and Pao (1978), was not confirmed in this study, which seems to be an indicative fact that the research on this theme in Brazil presents fragmentation as an intrinsic characteristic. That is, it must remain fragmented, as this would be its own way to evolve. This is evident especially when comparing the study of Andrighi et al. (2011) and its results. With several but continuous temporal cut-outs, and the same keywords, the maintenance of this dispersion is evident. This is also a contribution of this study. Social implications - The study contributed to updating the research profile, mainly after the triennium 2013-2015 of Qualis Capes' evaluations. It also added to the mapping of recent Brazilian academic production related to interorganizational networks, completing studies by Alves et al. (2013), Andrighi et al. (2011), Balestrin et al. (2010), Cunha and Carrieri (2003) and Mascena et al. (2013). Thus, it is believed that the research reached the proposed objectives, despite its limitations. Originality/value - The present research is also justified by helping to understand the subject being useful for researchers, educators and students, in general, in the task of demonstrating gaps and opportunities of future researches and collaborating with the elaboration of a research agenda (Baumgartner and Pieters, 2003). The work has updated bibliometrics on the subject and allows comparisons with previous bibliometric studies (Alves et al., 2013; Andrighi et al., 2011; Balestrin et al., 2010; Cunha and Carrieri, 2003; Ferreira et al., 2014; Lima and Campos Filho, 2009; Mascena et al., 2013). It is believed that the present study differs from the others because of the analysis performed, the way the data were treated, with techniques that are rarely used simultaneously, going beyond the descriptive statistics.",2018"Ma, Rongkang; Liu, Fengchao; Sun, Yutao","Collaboration partner portfolio along the growth of Chinese firms' innovation capability: configuration, evolution and pattern",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT,"This paper examines R& D collaboration of Chinese firms along the growth of innovation capability from the portfolio perspective.

The results show that: 1) Chinese mainland enterprises (CMEs) are active to engage in R& D collaboration, while most Taiwan-invested enterprises (TIEs) and foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) still develop innovation capabilities on their own; 2) the partner portfolios of CMEs with high growth rate are characterised by a smaller number of partners, lower level of repeated partnerships and higher collaboration intensity, while the low-growth CMEs just show an opposite trend; 3) universities have gradually become the most prominent partners of both high-growth and low-growth CMEs, but the firms are also experiencing a significant growth in their portfolios. By contrast, the role of research institutes is decreasing rapidly, especially in low-growth CMEs.

Perceived virtual network structures, namely virtual network connectivity (CN) and virtual network closeness (CL), are suggested as the important antecedents of knowledge sharing intentions in the context of virtual knowledge exchange communities. Anonymity (AN), one of the unique characteristics of virtual communities, but controversial due to its multi-faceted effects, is considered in a structural model as a factor having an impact on a virtual network structure. Data collected from participants of virtual communities through online surveys are analyzed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM) to empirically test the proposed hypotheses. The results reveal that both CN and CL have a significant impact on both of the knowledge exchange intentions although CL shows an opposite direction of the impact. The results also show that AN has a significant impact on CL as expected but not on CN. Implications of this study may shed some light on better understanding community participants' intentions to obtain and provide knowledge, along with the impact of anonymity on the perceived network structure.",2018"Basturk, Senol",Capital Battles: Labor Markets Benefits Access Channel of Youth and Social Networks in Turkey,JOURNAL OF ECONOMY CULTURE AND SOCIETY,"The number of findings indicated that social networks positively affect employment conditions of young workers. This kind of comment reveals that the positive effect is limited to middle-class youth. However, in this study, I will claim that social capital is an independent resource and must be seen as specific to working-class strategies. I used Turkish household labor survey covering paid employment in youth employment and I will test two hypotheses on the influence of social networks. The first one asserts that social networks commonly used by working-class and middle-class youth tend to enhance cultural capital resources. The second hypothesis claims that social networks are useful for obtaining the benefits of labor markets via private large-scale industrial employment for working-class youth; on the contrary, middle-class youth try to reach these benefits through managerial career paths.

They also need to know how the effects of these drivers are moderated by customer characteristics (e.g. gender, age, income, country). The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - To investigate these issues a built a large-scale multi-national database was created that includes attitudinal drivers, customer characteristics, and a full range of WOM behaviors, involving both the sending and receiving of both positive and negative WOM, with both strong and weak ties. The combination of sending-receiving, positive-negative and strong ties-weak ties results in a typology of eight distinct WOM behaviors. The investigation explores the drivers of those behaviors, and their moderators, using a hierarchical Bayes model in which all WOM behaviors are simultaneously modeled. Findings - Among the many important findings uncovered are: the most effective way to drive all positive WOM behaviors is through maximizing affective commitment and positive emotions; minimizing negative emotions and ensuring that customers are satisfied lowers all negative WOM behaviors; all other attitudinal drivers have lower or even mixed effects on the different WOM behaviors; and customer characteristics can have a surprisingly large impact on how attitudes affect different WOM behaviors. Practical implications - These findings have important managerial implications for promotion (which attitudes should be stimulated to produce the desired WOM behavior) and segmentation (how should marketing efforts change, based on segments defined by customer characteristics). Originality/value - This research points to the myriad of factors that enhance positive and reduce negative word-of-mouth, and the importance of accounting for customer heterogeneity in assessing the likely impact of attitudinal drivers on word-of-mouth behaviors.",2018"Orsingher, Chiara; Wirtz, Jochen",Psychological drivers of referral reward program effectiveness,JOURNAL OF SERVICES MARKETING,"Purpose Empirical research presents conflicting findings with regards to the effectiveness of referral reward programs (RRPs) and supports two alternative and conflicting views on the effectiveness of incentivizing recommendations. They are, first, a positive effect via perceived attractiveness of the incentive, and second, a negative effect via metaperception of the recommendation. The purpose of this paper is to examine these two opposing psychological mechanisms to reconcile the conflicting findings. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted three experiments. Study 1 tests the base model. Studies 2 and 3 add moderators to test whether each mediating variable operates exclusively on its intended relationship. Findings Incentive size enhanced the attractiveness of an incentive, but reduced the metaperception favorability of the recommendation. These two opposing mechanisms operated in parallel, independently and fully mediated the effects of incentive size to likelihood of making a recommendation. Thus, the net impact of incentives on recommendation behavior depended on the relative strengths of these two opposing forces. Practical implications The study recommends managers to design RRPs with incentives that recommenders perceive as highly useful (i.e. to increase attractiveness) but have a low face value (i.e. to reduce metaperception concerns) and to target RRPs to strong rather than weak ties. Originality/value Our work offers an integrated theoretical account of consumers' responses to incentivized recommendations and provides managerially relevant guidelines for the design of effective RRPs.",2018"Gomez, Edwin; Baur, Joshua W.

Dog parks represent small-scale places where social interaction can occur to improve the personal connections and interpersonal interactions that facilitate neighborhood livability and urban quality of life. The theoretical frameworks of bridging and bonding social capital were explored, in terms of weak/bridging and strong/bonding social ties, as aspects affecting perceived neighborhood social cohesion.

More specifically, it proposes that Facebook and Twitter are conducive to protest behavior through two distinct mechanisms: whereas the influence of Facebook use is more effective through communication with strong-tie networks, the impact of Twitter use is more effective through communication with weak-tie networks. To test these expectations, we analyze data from a cross-sectional, face-to-face survey on a representative sample of Chilean youths conducted in 2014. Findings in the study lend empirical support for these hypotheses. Consequently, while different social media (in this case, Facebook and Twitter) are similar in their participatory effects, the paths through which this influence occurs are distinct, a finding that highlights the importance of studying political behavior across different media platforms.",2018"Kahne, Joseph; Bowyer, Benjamin",The Political Significance of Social Media Activity and Social Networks,POLITICAL COMMUNICATION,"This paper examines panel data from two waves of the Youth Participatory Politics Survey, a nationally representative sample of young people in the United States.

Specifically, we examine the influence of Friendship-Driven (FD) and Interest-Driven (ID) online activity on online participatory politics and on offline forms of political action. Our findings reveal that FD and ID activity relate to political engagement, but in different ways. In addition, we find that the size of young people's social networks interacts with both FD and ID online activity to promote political activity. This indicates that having exposure to weak-ties (resulting from large social networks) promote higher levels of political engagement. These findings demonstrate the need to specify the kinds of online activities in which youth are engaged and, more broadly, the political significance of social media and social networks",2018"Ayu, Aulia Suminar",Maximizing Garbage Clinical Insurance Adoption Through Communication Network,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION STUDIES (ICOMACS 2018),"Innovation is an idea that considered as new thing by its adoption unit.

How the news and the strength of the ties in the political discussion foster reciprocity,REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA,"Reciprocity, a social principle that emerges in non-negotiated, inter-personal exchange, is arguably a key construct in generating social capital. However, little research has made this empirical connection. Building on an Orientation-Stimulus-Reasoning-Orientation-Response model, this study advances a theoretical and empirical model in which news use and political discussion tie strength contributes to the development of reciprocity and social capital. Drawing on two-wave panel data, results suggest that reciprocity is a strong predictor of social capital. News media use also directly predicts reciprocity, as well as political discussion with both strong and weak ties, and social capital. Additionally, discussion with weak ties and reciprocity mediate the relationship between news use and social capital.",2018"Norbutas, Lukas; Corten, Rense",Network structure and economic prosperity in municipalities: A large-scale test of social capital theory using social media data,SOCIAL NETWORKS,"In this study, we analyze the relationship between network structure and economic prosperity in 438 Dutch municipalities. We focus on the structural aspects of social capital theory and test how three forms of social capital- network density, fragmentation (bonding), diversity and geographical distance of ties (bridging)- are associated with economic prosperity at the municipality level. We use data from a Dutch online social network that consists of more than 10 million users to test the hypotheses. We find that communities that have high network diversity are also more prosperous economically, while high network fragmentation is associated with lower prosperity. Contrary to previous literature, we find some support that network density at the community level is negatively associated with economic prosperity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The use of lay health workers (LHWs) has been suggested by policy makers across the world as an intervention to identify risks to health and to promote health, particularly in disadvantaged communities. However, there have been few attempts to theorize the work undertaken by LHWs to understand how interventions work. In this article, the authors present the concept of 'synthetic social support' and distinguish it from the work of health professionals or the spontaneous social support received from friends and family. The authors provide new empirical data to illustrate the concept based on qualitative, observational research, using a novel shadowing method involving clinical and non-clinical researchers, on the everyday work of 'pregnancy outreach workers' (POWs) in Birmingham, UK. The service was being evaluated as part of a randomized controlled trial. These LHWs provided instrumental, informational, emotional and appraisal support to the women they worked with, which are all key components of social support. The social support was 'synthetic' because it was distinct from the support embedded in spontaneous social networks: it was non-reciprocal; it was offered on a strictly time-limited basis; the LHWs were accountable for the relationship, and the social networks produced were targeted rather than spontaneous. The latter two qualities of this synthetic form of social support may have benefits over spontaneous networks by improving the opportunities for the cultivation of new relationships (both strong and weak ties) outside the women's existing spontaneous networks that can have a positive impact on them and by offering a reliable source of health information and support in a chaotic environment. The concept of SSS can help inform policy makers about how deploying lay workers may enable them to achieve desired outcomes, specify their programme theories and evaluate accordingly.",2018"Brown, Sean F.",Benefactors and beneficiaries in social capital exchanges,SPORT IN SOCIETY,"Social capital research that specifically interrogates the motives for both benefactors and beneficiaries typically gives short shrift to the motives of beneficiaries, instead focusing on those of benefactors.

Based on fieldwork in a youth baseball league in the American Southwest, I will argue that recipient motives for accepting (or asking for) help from another parent in the league are complex and worth studying on their own merit.

The interviews looked for narratives that described their interactions with different information sources, and the role that weak ties play as sources of information and social support that help them make sense of their lives in Israel.

First, the results suggest that only some types of social capital are relevant for labor force participation: namely, networks with weaker yet far-reaching connections, including higher-status individuals. There are neither empirical nor theoretical reasons to believe that women have better access to such networks than men. Second, this type of social capital is only relevant for the economic integration of the richest women, failing to increase labor force participation among women of the other 80 percent of households. Thus, this study concludes that policies targeted at women's economic integration based on the presumption that women have more social capital than men are deeply flawed.",2018"Souiden, Nizar; Ladhari, Riadh; Chang, Liu",Chinese perception and willingness to buy Taiwanese brands: The role of ethnocentrism and animosity,ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine ethnocentrism and animosity in a special context of two societies that share cultural, historical, ethnic and geographical characteristics. In particular, it first investigates the relationships between Chinese ethnocentrism and animosity toward Taiwan, and then it examines the impact of these two factors on the Chinese perception of Taiwanese brand quality and their purchase intent. Design/methodology/approach Based on a sample of 605 respondents from China, data were analyzed by structural equation modeling. Findings The results show that although Chinese animosity toward Taiwan is moderate, it is significantly driven by ethnocentrism, which has a significant and negative effect on willingness to buy, but not on the perception of Taiwanese brand quality. The Chinese animosity toward Taiwan, however, has negative and significant effects on their perception of Taiwanese brand quality and their intention of purchasing Taiwanese brands. Research limitations/implications The immense size of the country has impeded the representativeness of the authors' sample and the generalizability of the results. Also, the study covers only one type of product. Practical implications Forming partnerships with local Chinese businesses and developing strong ties with local communities could be considered as a solution to minimize or circumvent the effect of animosity and might help foreign companies appear more local. Originality/value In contrast to past studies that investigated ethnocentrism and animosity in the context of countries presenting several differences (e.g. China vs USA), this study investigates the effect of ethnocentrism and animosity in the context of two countries (China and Taiwan) that share cultural, historical, ethnic and geographic characteristics. Despite the strong ties between the two countries, the Chinese have a certain animosity, though moderate, toward Taiwan and consequently are less inclined to buy Taiwanese brands. This implies that Chinese animosity toward a country may be toned down or pronounced, depending on whether they have strong or weak ties with that country.",2018"Goswami, Anil Kumar; Agrawal, Rakesh Kumar",A reflection on knowledge sharing research: patterns and trends,VINE JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to bring to the fore the identity and image of knowledge sharing (KS) research in terms of the patterns and trends of its growth and its intellectual structure by systematically and objectively extracting various information from extant literature published in KS research area.

The empirical study took place in Phnom Penh. Design/methodology/approach Focus group and in-depth interviews were employed. Two SHGs in Phnom Penh were selected for this study. The social network approach was used to distinguish the type of nodes and cliques within SHGs. Findings The result suggests that there exist lending and borrowing nodes and cliques. Strong ties exist within a clique and only weak ties link between cliques. Job and business information transmits well on weak ties but not entrepreneurship.

Regression modelling of General Social Survey data reveals that the variability of racial identity at the individual and category levels provides a mechanism for explaining the racial gap in social networks. Racial identities act as symbolic tools that allow actors to establish divergent quantities of social ties. For whites, a weaker racial identity increases network size and weak ties, but for blacks, it decreases both outcomes.",2018"Brouthers, Keith D.; Geisser, Kim Dung; Rothlauf, Franz",Explaining the Internationalization of iBusiness Firms,INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP: THE PURSUIT OF OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS NATIONAL BORDERS,,2018"Bongomin, George Okello Candiya; Munene, John C.; Ntayi, Joseph Mpeera; Malinga, Charles Akol",Social network: Testing the predictive power of its dimensions in explaining financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda,AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT STUDIES,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to test for the predictive power of each of the dimensions of social network in explaining financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. Design/methodology/approach The study employed a cross-sectional research design and data were collected from a total of 400 poor households located in Northern, Eastern, Central and Western Uganda. The authors adopted ordinary least square hierarchical regression analysis to test for the predictive power of each of the dimensions of social network in explaining financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. The effects were determined by calculating the significant change in coefficient of determination (R-2) between the dimensions of social network in explaining financial inclusion. In addition, analysis of variance was also used to test for variation in perceptions of the poor about being financially included. Findings The findings revealed that the dimensions of ties and interaction significantly explain financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. Contrary to previous studies, the results indicated that interdependence as a dimension of social network is not a significant predictor of financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. Combined together, the dimensions of social network explains about 16.6 percent of the variation in financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. Research limitations/implications The study was purely cross-sectional, thus, ignoring longitudinal survey design, which could have investigated certain characteristics of the variable over time. Additionally, although a total sample amounting to 400 poor households was used in the study, the results cannot be generalized since other equally marginalized groups such as the disabled persons, refugees, and immigrants were not included in this study. Furthermore, the study used only the questionnaire to elicit responses from the respondents. The use of interview was ignored during data collection. Practical implications Policy makers, managers of financial institutions, and financial inclusion advocates should consider social network dimensions of ties and interaction as conduits for information flow and sharing among the poor including the women and youth about scarce financial resources like loans. Advocacy towards creation of societal network that brings the poor together in strong and weak ties is very important in scaling up access to and use of scarce financial services for improving economic and social well-being. Originality/value Contrary to previous studies, this particular study test the predictive power of each of the dimensions of social network in explaining financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. Thus, it methodologically isolates the individual contribution of each of the dimensions of social network in explaining financial inclusion of the poor. The authors found that only ties and interaction are significant predictors of financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. Therefore, the findings suggest that not all dimensions of social network are significant predictors of financial inclusion as opposed to previous empirical findings.",2018"Makarov, Ilya; Bulanov, Oleg; Gerasimova, Olga; Meshcheryakov, Natalia; Karpov, Ilia; Zhukov, Leonid E.",Scientific Matchmaker: Collaborator Recommender System,"ANALYSIS OF IMAGES, SOCIAL NETWORKS AND TEXTS, AIST 2017","Modern co-authorship networks contain hidden patterns of researchers interaction and publishing activities.

This study aims to examine the contribution of social networks in acquiring resources and their role in the enterprise's success. Design/methodology/approach A business's success is influenced by its network structure and the network's resources. The authors examine whether unique religious-cultural characteristics affect the social networks contribution to a business's success. This model examines the network utilization of women entrepreneurs who own micro-enterprises in ultra-religious groups. The sample consists of 123 surveys completed by Jewish ultra-Orthodox women entrepreneurs in Israel. Data collection was conducted between February and June 2013. The authors used a snowball sampling approach where interviewees were asked to refer us to other entrepreneurs. In the hour-long interview, a questionnaire was used with open and closed questions. Findings Findings indicate that strong personal ties provide a micro-enterprise with social legitimacy, emotional support and assistance in the management and operation of daily activities. However, contrary to the existing literature, network utilization did not contribute to enterprise success. That is, in religious communities in particular, social networks enable the existence of businesses, but do not contribute to their success. Practical implications The practical implications of this paper are the mapping of the social network resources used by the business owner, such as financial consultations or professional assistance, as well as distinguishing between strong and weak ties, which reflect the intensity of the contact for better use of the social network by the entrepreneurs.

Specifically, it considers social capital (i.e., the result of a firm's inter-organizational relationships) as an essential precursor of knowledge identification capabilities and deliberated knowledge acquisition strategies. This study aims to propose that cognitive and relational dimensions of a firm's inter-organizational social capital are mediating factors of the relationship between structural social capital and knowledge identification capabilities and the relationship between structural social capital and the deliberated acquisition of external knowledge, respectively. The relationship between knowledge identification capability and external knowledge acquisition is also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach This is a cross-sectional quantitative study with a sample of 87 firms from Spanish biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. From an extensive literature review, we developed three hypotheses that were tested using the partial least squares technique and structural equations model. Findings The results only support a mediating effect of cognitive social capital in the relationship between structural social capital and knowledge identification capability and a partial mediation effect of relational social capital in the relationship between structural social capital and knowledge acquisition. In addition, the findings show that firms with more advanced abilities to identify and assess the value of external knowledge will be likely to develop optimal deliberated strategies to acquire effectively such knowledge from its network partners. Research limitations/implications The limitations of this study are small sample size and the cross-sectional nature of the study. The study also focuses on only two specific and innovative industries. Practical implications Managers should understand that good management of inter-organizational social capital allows the firm to develop dynamic capabilities for the identification and acquisition of valuable knowledge. The results of the study show that managers should concentrate on building knowledge identification capabilities and should also be aware of the possibilities that social capital can provide to a firm to formulate and implement effective strategies for external knowledge acquisition. Originality/value To date, there are relatively few studies focussing on knowledge identification capability and its relationships with the dimensions of a company's social capital as enablers of external knowledge acquisition. For managers, the identification of valuable knowledge by using inter-organizational relationships and networks is an essential issue, especially in innovative industries characterized by continuous change. Theoretically, this research highlights that social capital contributes to the development of dynamic capabilities, allowing the firm to sense and seize business opportunities based on external knowledge acquisition to achieve competitive advantages.",2018"Bryant, Joanne","Building inclusion, maintaining marginality: how social andhealth services act as capital for young substance users",JOURNAL OF YOUTH STUDIES,"This paper draws on Bourdieusian concepts to examine the social mechanisms driving service choices' for marginalised young substance users. In doing so, it problematises the individualised understandings of choice-making' common in the existing literature. The paper uses interview data collected from 26 young substance users to describe the resources they bring to their service encounters, the capitals that they acquire through these interactions, and the ways in which these are mobilised within the fields in which they operate. The analysis finds that services acted as capital-building settings- participants acquired material resources and opportunities for skill-building, and they built relationships that contributed to a positive sense of identity and belonging. But the exchange potentials attached to these capitals were restricted by the logics of service fields that cast them as deficit and limited their opportunities to build productive forms of social capital. By revealing the social mechanisms behind service choices', the analysis suggests that the most effective services are those that maximise the opportunities for their young clients to build weak ties', such as with a diverse range of adults who themselves possess resources, and those that acknowledge the identities that young people already possess as rational and self-managing.",2018"Sargent, Matthew D.",Marriage Institutions and the Formation of Cross-Cultural Knowledge Networks in Early Modern Southeast Asia,JOURNAL OF EARLY MODERN HISTORY,"This article explores the ways in which Europeans encountered indigenous knowledge in Asia and the Americas during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and reconstructs the social factors that enabled productive cross-cultural knowledge encounters within a particular temporal and cultural context. By focusing on the tacit nature of medical knowledge and on the structure of the networks that enabled cross-cultural brokerage I develop a framework that explains why knowledge exchange occurred in some situations and not in others. In particular, I argue that a unique marriage institution that emerged in the Dutch-controlled regions of the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the seventeenth-century fostered European access to indigenous botanical knowledge by reshaping the patterns of relationships that linked European, mestiza, and indigenous cultures. Women in Southeast Asia were the important medical practitioners within their local communities. By fostering and formalizing relationships with Asian and mestiza women this marriage institution both created direct ties with local experts while also integrating European men in to a community who relied primarily on local botanical cures for their medical care and who could broker relationships with local practitioners.",2018"Bongomin, George Okello Candiya; Ntayi, Joseph M.; Munene, John C.; Malinga, Charles Akol",Mobile Money and Financial Inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa: the Moderating Role of Social Networks,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN BUSINESS,"The purpose of this article is to test the moderating effect of social networks in the relationship between mobile money usage and financial inclusion in rural Uganda. The results revealed that there is a significant and positive moderating effect of social networks in the relationship between mobile money usage and financial inclusion in rural Uganda. Besides, mobile money usage and social networks have direct and significant effects on financial inclusion in rural Uganda. Thus, the findings suggest that existence of social networks of strong and weak ties among mobile money users promote financial inclusion in rural Uganda. Previous studies have concentrated only on investigating the impact of mobile money in promoting financial inclusion in developing economies, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Using a novel approach and nationwide sample survey, we measure various aspects of migrant networks such as size, diversity, efficiency and experience content and estimate their effect on probability of employment. Our findings suggest that migrant stock (having experience content) has an inverted-U relationship with the probability of finding a job for a migrant. The share of employed workers in a migrant network (efficiency) and different origin identity (diversity) positively affect the employment outcome through weak ties. Further, the migrant network effect is more active in larger cities as compared to smaller urban areas. The implications of this study indicate towards the importance of non-market informal channels in job searches and the need for integrating labour markets to harness the benefits of larger positive network externalities.",2018"Nziku, Dina Modestus; Struthers, John Joseph",Female entrepreneurship in Africa: Strength of weak ties in mitigating principal-agent problems,JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework which combines the strength of weak ties (SWT) concept with an innovative taxonomy for mitigating principal-agent (P-A) conflicts. The taxonomy highlights the mechanisms through which African women can overcome the obstacles faced when setting up businesses. Design/methodology/approach The paper discusses the role of weak ties networks in entrepreneurial activities and integrates the concept with the key parameters of the P-A paradigm. The aim is to develop a taxonomy (or scorecard) for mitigating the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs in Africa from a P-A perspective. Six P-A parameters are analysed, namely, attitudes towards risk; behaviour-based vs targets-based contracts; asymmetric information; risk-sharing; transaction costs; and verification and monitoring costs. Findings With the aid of the taxonomy developed in the paper, the authors analyse the channels through which SWT networks may impact in mitigating the problems arising from the P-A paradigm. Some implications for women entrepreneurs in Africa are highlighted. Research limitations/implications The current conceptual study suggests that the SWT concept can be used by African women entrepreneurs to mitigate P-A problems. The authors argue that the original P-A taxonomy developed in the paper fills a conceptual research gap in the existing literature. Embedding the SWT concept within a P-A framework will facilitate further research not only to understand African women entrepreneurs' attitudes (and responses) towards risk and uncertainty, but this will also facilitate greater understanding of the importance women attach to the role of incentives within their businesses. Practical implications The taxonomy presents new insights for understanding the most serious constraints that hinder women entrepreneurs in Africa. The taxonomy will be the basis for a follow-up empirical paper on selected African countries. Originality/value The originality of this study lies in the development of an innovative taxonomy which highlights the role of SWT social networks towards mitigating the P-A problem among African women entrepreneurs.

We posit that the effectiveness of specific structural feature of sales intrafirm networks (i.e., the number and strength of salesperson intrafirm ties) depends on whether cross-functional collaboration occurs with marketing or customer service. These differences exist because each function has distinct goals and competencies. Using network data from salespeople working for a chemical manufacturer, we found that having few sales-marketing total ties increase salesperson performance, while having many ties with customer service results in better sales results. We also found that strong ties with marketing colleagues lead to high sales growth while sales-customer service collaboration benefits more when ties are weak. Moderating effects show that the combination of few strong ties with marketing and of many weak ties with customer service boosts salesperson performance. While we found that total ties with marketing have a U-shaped effect on salesperson performance, there is an inverted U-shaped effect for sales-customer service collaborations and thus an optimal number of ties. This study advances our understanding of cross-functional collaboration in sales intrafirm network research. From a managerial perspective, our findings suggest that salespeople benefit from network steering capabilities when managing cross-functional contacts. In addition, sales managers benefit from a set of intrafirm network interventions that improve sales-force effectiveness.",2018"Yamamoto, Masahiro",Examining the Role of Communication Activities in Perceived Collective Efficacy and Neighborhood Violence,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION,This study examines two communication-based sources of neighborhood collective efficacy: communication ties with neighbors and local media use.

This paper contributes to the cluster literature with a better contextualization and understanding of the relationship between structural social capital and knowledge acquisition. In addition, the paper also consolidates the inter-organizational approach to social capital theory by helping to understand how and in what context social capital dimensions are interrelated.

To accomplish a participatory task effectively and efficiently, the team formation problem (TFP) outweighs all other considerations. It is even more complicated when social connections among candidates is taken into account. As we can imagine, a large number of tasks require members of the team to be socially close. On the contrary, a portion of tasks, e.g., proposal review, pay more attention to a multidimensional view, and team members should be selected from a variety of cliques. Due to the nature of tasks, it is challenging to find a subset that meets the skill requirement of the task as well as socially diversity demand of team members from a pool of candidates. In this paper, we explore the in a social network. Based on different task objectives, we first formulate the as TFP with strong ties (TFP-ST) and with weak ties (TFP-WT), respectively. Both TFP-ST and TFP-WT are proven to be NP-hard, and we then design corresponding heuristic algorithms to solve the two problems. Through extensive simulations, we show that the solution to TFP-ST can achieve significant improvement in terms of collaboration cost, team size, as well as running time, and the solution to TFP-WT can provide better performance than existing approaches at the same time.",2018"Zarouali, Brahim; Poels, Karolien; Walrave, Michel; Ponnet, Koen","You talking to me?' The influence of peer communication on adolescents' persuasion knowledge and attitude towards social advertisements	BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY												This article examines how peer communication among adolescents (14-16 years) affects the evaluation of social advertising (i.e. targeted ad that adopts the social proof heuristic by using an individual's social ties as endorsers for a brand) on social networking sites (SNSs). More precisely, the focus lies on how engaging in online peer chatting on these social platforms alters persuasion knowledge and attitude towards the ad. In order to test this, two between-subjects experiments were conducted in which adolescents chatted with peers on a mock SNS that contained a social ad. In Experiment 1, results reveal that a social ad generates a more positive attitude among adolescents when they have engaged in online peer communication, and at the same time, triggers less persuasion knowledge. In Experiment 2, the depth of the relationship between the chatters (tie strength) plays a significant moderating role as peer communication with strong ties yields greater effects, compared to communication with weak ties. These findings reveal important social influence dynamics that may alter the elaboration of persuasive communication, leading to valuable theoretical and practical implications.																	0144-929X	1362-3001					2018	37	5					502	516		10.1080/0144929X.2018.1458903							WOS:000430498500006						J	Huang, C; Wang, Y				Huang, Chun; Wang, Yan			Evolution of network relations, enterprise learning, and cluster innovation networks: the case of the Yuyao plastics industry cluster	TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT												Industrial clusters have become a crucial carrier of economic globalisation. However, constrained by the nation's industrial development model, clusters in China have long been relegated to a low-end position. This study, based on the perspective of focal enterprises, analysed the relationships among network relations, enterprise learning, and the evolution of cluster innovation networks and explored the three formation stages of a cluster innovation network by examining the example of the Yuyao plastics industry cluster. The results showed (1) that focal enterprises exert spin-off effects on enterprise learning and are critical for innovation networking and (2) that weak network ties facilitate exploratory learning, whereas strong ties influence exploitative learning. In addition, tie strength showed a coevolutionary feature. Furthermore, the results showed that (3) this evolutionary process demonstrated a phase-changing characteristic, with government policy exhibiting substantial effects on focal enterprises, organisational learning mechanisms, and cluster innovation networks.																	0953-7325	1465-3990					2018	30	2					158	171		10.1080/09537325.2017.1297786							WOS:000430262400003						J	Mesch, GS				Mesch, Gustavo S.			Race, ethnicity and the strength of Facebook ties	JOURNAL OF YOUTH STUDIES												This study investigates the role of race and ethnicity in the self-reported strength of the social ties of young adolescents on Facebook. Based on the social diversification hypothesis, which argues that in multicultural societies, race and ethnicity are key factors that shape the nature of associations, we examine whether there are ethnic and racial differences in the size and strength of the ties of adolescent Facebook users and the role of the strength of these ties in several positive outcomes. Using data from the U.S. Teens' Social Media and Privacy Survey conducted by the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life project among 802 teens ages 12-17, we found no differences in the total number of ties that adolescents from different ethnic and racial groups reported. However, African Americans reported significantly higher number of weak ties, while White Americans had a significantly higher number of strong ties. The results are consistent with the social diversification hypothesis.

Using data from a survey of 143 employees from Chinese firms, the article found that both types of interpersonal trust positively related to explicit knowledge seeking, as well as tacit knowledge seeking. The article also found that cognition-based trust had a stronger relationship with seeking of both explicit and tacit knowledge than affect-based trust.

Healthcare information technology and associated systems, such as those supporting online healthcare communities (OHCs) that provide new platforms for information exchange and online communication, are expected to alter traditional D-P relationship models. Despite significant results from extant research indicating patient benefits, empirical research on OHC returns for physicians is lacking. This exploratory study examines the strength of the D-P relationship and its impacts on physicians' individual outcomes in an OHC. Guided by the social capital and social ties theories, and using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to study 339,010 instances of doctor-patient communication from 1430 physicians at The Good Doctor (www.Haodf.com), which is one of the largest Chinese OHCs, we found that weak ties can result in economic and social returns for doctors. However, further analysis has indicated that strong ties mediate the effect of weak ties, thus encouraging doctors to convert weak ties into strong ties by mobilizing their website settings to strengthen their relationships and, subsequently, to be better rewarded.

First, in addition to total social spending, we examine whether different types of social spending increase social capital among their target groups. Second, we distinguish within- from between-country effects of social spending. Data from the European Social Survey are analysed with logistic multilevel regression models. We analyse two indicators of informal social capital: having social contact with friends, family or work colleagues and having anyone to discuss intimate and personal matters with. The results show that the more governments spend on social protection, the more likely people within those countries are to have social and intimate contact. The results also demonstrate that within-country effects of the types of social spending on having social contact disappear once we control for unobserved heterogeneity between countries. Yet, within countries with higher social spending on sickness/health care, old age and social exclusion, we find that these specific expenditures facilitate intimate contact among people in bad health, retirees and people who are having difficulties living on their present income, respectively. Overall, the crowding in hypothesis is supported. We conclude that it is important to examine the types of social spending and to distinguish within- and between-country effects.

Accordingly, this research explores social capital in two Asia-Pacific service enterprise cases - a Thai coffee franchise and a Coffee Roasters Guild in Australia. In the Thai case, social capital in the service experience emerged from norms common in Thai society and manifested via social enterprise initiatives. Findings from Australia indicate social capital helps form a strong organizational identity leading to better economic and social outcomes and an enhanced service experience, benefiting numerous stakeholders.

As well as physical strength and driving technique, skills to adjust equipment are critical for racers to win a race. Based on the contingency theory of social capital, this study analysed comprehensive panel data of motorboat racers and revealed that bonding and bridging social capital had different impacts on performance according to life cycle stages of racers and changes in regulation. First, bonding social capital has a positive impact on performance when racers are less experienced and most need psychological aid stemming from strong ties. Second, bridging social capital has a positive impact on performance when racers are more experienced and have accumulated absorptive capacity to learn efficiently from diverse sources of knowledge. Third, both bonding and bridging social capital lose their explanatory power after the changes in regulation that shifted ownership of propellers from racers to the authority, which could mitigate the significance of the formation of small groups among racers to share cost and knowledge regarding the improvement in propellers.

Design/methodology/approach A case study, which formed a large online ethnographic project, was conducted in which the twin methods of participatory observation and in-depth interviews were used to access the experience of a selected group (n = 60) of college students. Findings The present paper identifies that young adults' participation in micro-charity is mainly driven by three underlying mechanisms: the formation of a powerful environment for the distribution of awareness of obligation, creation of trust towards others in distant or weak ties and symbolic construction of collective identity with a shared commitment. Originality/value This paper is an exploratory work which sheds new light on charity or other social entrepreneurship development in the social media era.

Drawing on a meta-analytical approach, we synthesize the results of 102 empirical studies to test whether network characteristics such as centrality, brokerage, and tie strength similarly influence the job performance of individuals and groups. Results show that while there are no differences in the direction of the network-performance relationship across levels, there are substantial differences in magnitude. Individual performance profits more strongly from a high number of direct connections, whereas groups reap higher benefits from brokerage positions. Additional analyses reveal that the network measurement method, tie content, and performance criteria function as moderators of the network performance relationship, but their influence is consistent neither across network characteristics nor across levels. By meta-analytically comparing and contrasting the network-performance relationship for individuals and groups, we contribute to multilevel research on networks and organizations. Particularly, we move toward the development of a multilevel homology theory of networks. Implications for theory, practice, and future research are discussed. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Using data from one of the largest social stock-picking marketplaces, this study explores whether and how various aspects of an individual's social networks affect his or her investment performance. Using social network methodologies and theory of social learning, this study explores the outcomes of such networks and herding behavior on investors' performance. In particular, this study examines how different types of social learningdirect and indirect impact investment performance. The results show that the network structure of a user's network (indirect social learning) has an impact on performance; in particular, following people with structural holes contributes to improved investment performance. This study also analyzes two different modes of herding (direct social learning), and finds that while information-based herding leads to improved performance, reputation-based herding negatively affects performance. This study extends the theoretical implications regarding the role of different types of social learning in the investment realm. Platform providers should thus consider the various types of information provided to investors in the marketplace to facilitate social learning behavior that improves investment outcomes. Investors should also distinguish the type of social learning that improves their own investment outcomes.																	1086-4415	1557-9301					2018	22	1					66	97		10.1080/10864415.2018.1396119							WOS:000425712600004						J	Ramon-Hidalgo, AE; Kozak, RA; Harshaw, HW; Tindall, DB				Ramon-Hidalgo, Ana-Elia; Kozak, Robert A.; Harshaw, H.

Differential Effects of Cognitive and Structural Social Capital on Empowerment in Two Community Ecotourism Projects in Ghana	SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES												Researchers have cautioned against both erasing conceptual complexities and homogenizing communities in community-based natural resources (CBNRM) studies and interventions. Social capital is seen as an enabler of CBNRM, yet we argue that differential access to social capital and associated outcomes deserves greater attention to avoid oversimplification of community interventions. Drawing upon literature on social networks and social capital, we analyze survey and network data from two community ecotourism cases in Ghana to advance understanding of the empowering capacities and limitations of CBNRM through social capital access. Subpopulations within communities are considered. Results show that residents with greater access to social capital report greater levels of empowerment. However, that relationship seems to be conditioned by one's involvement, demographics, and by the empowerment dimension under analysis. Implications of the differing relationships between cognitive and structural social capital in relation to several empowerment outcomes are discussed from theoretical, methodological, and practical perspectives.

Results show that mobile money adoption is positively influenced by the size of the social network with which information is exchanged. We further find that this effect is particularly pronounced for non-poor households. Thus, while social networks represent an important target for policy-makers aiming to promote mobile money technology, the poorest households are likely to be excluded and require more tailored policy programmes and assistance.

The purpose of the article is to examine the role of social networks and social identities for the differentiated labour market integration outcomes among Ghanaian immigrants in the city of Bergen. Based on data produced through in-depth interviews, participant observation and informal conversations, the authors argue that Ghanaian immigrants' ability to obtain jobs is determined by more than simply having the appropriate educational and language qualifications, and largely depends on having favourable social identities and being embedded in social networks beyond the Ghanaian immigrant community. They find that those who mainly relied on Ghanaian networks found it difficult to circumvent labour market hindrances and they predominantly obtained menial jobs. The authors conclude that Norwegian job-seekers networks played a crucial role in the immigrants' opportunities and for potential Norwegian employers' perception of their employability, especially in professional and semi-professional jobs.																	0029-1951	1502-5292					2018	72	1					27	36		10.1080/00291951.2017.1406402							WOS:000423703200003						J	Chase, LE; Rousseau, C				Chase, Liana E.; Rousseau, Cecile			Ethnographic Case Study of a Community Day Center for Asylum Seekers as Early Stage Mental Health Intervention	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPSYCHIATRY												Clinical guidelines in refugee mental health increasingly advocate phased approaches to intervention that foreground the provision of pragmatic and social support in contexts of ongoing instability. However, the impact of such interventions has rarely been explored from the perspective of refugees themselves. We conducted ethnographic research on the experiences and perceptions of users of an intervention embodying this approach: a community Day Center for asylum seekers in Montreal. Data comprising 15 interviews and field notes from 50 participant observation visits were analyzed using an established theoretical framework to identify mechanisms supporting self-perceived wellbeing among users in the domains of safety, social networks, justice, identity/roles, and existential meaning. Results shed light on how this nonspecific buffering intervention responds to the threats and pressures asylum seekers themselves identify as most salient in the immediate postflight context. These findings are discussed in relation to emerging theoretical frameworks in refugee mental health that emphasize agency, justice, and the role of local ecologies. We conclude that the Day Center shows significant promise as an innovative early stage mental health intervention for precarious status migrants and merits further research and evaluation.

As such, given the enormous time and investment required for students to pursue an MBA and the role of electives in forming the student's knowledge base, it is important to consider the decision process of students while selecting elective courses as they pursue their degree. Design/methodology/approach - This study explores the relevance of network characteristics in the elective selection phenomena through questionnaires administered personally to 50 MBA students from a premier b-school in India. Thereby, it seeks to link the implications with MBA efficacy. Findings - In the sample, the authors found that social network connections in terms of homophily and heterophily (similar and dissimilar others) had the strongest association with elective course decisions. Further, the role of tie strength (the level of intensity of the social relationship between two individuals) in governing the phenomena was not confirmed. Practical implications - The authors discuss the linkage of elective selection phenomena with the efficacy of MBA. Specifically, the authors focus on a possible risk where network influences may prompt a student to select electives by surpassing his or her academic interests and thereby may hamper the efficacy. The authors also outline implications from the perspective of students, professors, and administrators. Originality/value - The study is among the initial studies to present preliminary evidence on the efficacy of MBA from the perspective of elective selection phenomena and the role of social network effects.																	0951-354X	1758-6518					2018	32	1					84	95		10.1108/IJEM-01-2017-0005							WOS:000419323200006						J	Abizaid, C; Coomes, OT; Takasaki, Y; Arroyo-Mora, JP				Abizaid, Christian; Coomes, Oliver T.; Takasaki, Yoshito; Arroyo-Mora, J. Pablo			Rural Social Networks along Amazonian Rivers: Seeds, Labor and Soccer among Communities on the Napo River, Peru	GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW												Research on Amazonian communities has focussed more often on rural-urban linkages than on links among rural communities. This is unsurprising, given the low density of population, limited intercommunity commerce, and importance of direct city-market relations. Social relations among rural communities are also important in shaping rural livelihoods and lifeways. We report on the findings of a large-scale census of communities in the Napo River basin in northeastern Peru (n=174). Data were gathered on intervillage crop seed acquisition and cooperative labor sharing as two key inputs in agriculture, and on intervillage soccer matches, which are integral to rural social life. We analyze the socio-spatial networks of each practice, paying attention to settlement patterns, community ethnicity, and differential access to the uplands. We find that seeds and labor flow along soccer network lines. Rural social networks appear to be structured strongly by ethnicity (homophily) and reflect important complementarities between upland and lowland communities (weak ties).																	0016-7428	1931-0846				JAN	2018	108	1					92	119		10.1111/gere.12244							WOS:000418352100006						J	Shah, NP; Levin, DZ; Cross, R				Shah, Neha P.; Levin, Daniel Z.; Cross, Rob			Secondhand social capital: Boundary spanning, secondhand closure, and individual performance	SOCIAL NETWORKS												We move beyond the performance returns of individuals' direct network connections to study the effects of secondhand"" social capital, i.e., from the networks of one's contacts. We propose that certain colleagues may be more valuable to one's job performance than others when their spillovers of novel information combine with spillovers of the cooperation needed to obtain that novelty. In a study of 1273 research and development employees across 16 business units, we find that the most benefit to one's own performance comes from having ties that span business units and that also include secondhand closure (i.e., where one's contacts are each embedded in a constrained, dense network). Bridging the organizational boundary provides the novelty; and secondhand closure provides the cooperation. Further, by examining who in the network is constraining these contacts, we are able to trace their cooperative motivation both to reputational and organizational identity concerns, which each create a spillover of cooperation toward the focal individual, who reaps the returns.

Analyses from the 2008 Chinese General Social Survey show that the gender gap in network-based job searching is larger in the market sector than in the state sector, as the gender status beliefs are more legitimate in the former than in the latter. Additionally, the sector difference of the gender gap in network based job searching is significant when the resources channeled through networks are information related, but it is insignificant when the network resources are influence-related. These findings indicate that job searching is double embedded in social networks and in cultural institutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The strength of strong ties in new product adoption,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH,"We study the relationship between opinion leadership and susceptibility to social influence in new product adoption and how this relationship varies with tie strength in social networks. Data analysis based on a sociometric survey indicates that opinion leaders are less sensitive to informational influence than non-leaders. Furthermore, individuals with moderate levels of leadership are more susceptible to normative influence than individuals with high or low levels of leadership. We also find evidence of the moderating effect of tie strength. While opinion leaders are less susceptible to informational influence from weak-tie peers, they are equally sensitive to informational influence from strong-tie peers as non-leaders. More interestingly, the inverse-U relationship between self-reported leadership and normative influence holds for strong ties, whereas this pattern between sociometric leadership and normative influence holds for weak ties.

But what features of human interaction build a strong tie? Here we approach this question from a practical way by finding what are the properties of social interactions that make ties more persistent and thus stronger to maintain social interactions in the future. Using a large longitudinal mobile phone database we build a predictive model of tie persistence based on intensity, intimacy, structural and temporal patterns of social interaction. While our results confirm that structural (embeddedness) and intensity (number of calls) features are correlated with tie persistence, temporal features of communication events are better and more efficient predictors for tie persistence. Specifically, although communication within ties is always bursty we find that ties that are more bursty than the average are more likely to decay, signaling that tie strength is not only reflected in the intensity or topology of the network, but also on how individuals distribute time or attention across their relationships. We also found that stable relationships have and require a constant rhythm and if communication is halted for more than 8 times the previous communication frequency, most likely the tie will decay. Our results not only are important to understand the strength of social relationships but also to unveil the entanglement between the different temporal scales in networks, from microscopic tie burstiness and rhythm to macroscopic network evolution.",2017"Zhang, Fangfeng; Zeng, An; Ma, Bowen; Fan, Ying; Di, Zengru",Uncovering heterogeneous interactions in online commercial networks,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"With the rapid development of Internet, the research on online commercial networks has become crucial for filtering out irrelevant information for users and predicting their future interest. The common methods for understanding such typical user-item networks are mainly projecting them to unipartite ones with only positive ratings, which may result in losing a large amount of information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to construct a signed unipartite network with heterogeneous interactions (i.e. positive or negative) between users from the original bipartite network. Based on the signed similarity, we carry out the percolation analysis on this signed unipartite network, which reveals a phase transition phenomenon. The statistical features of the giant component consisting of the positive and negative interactions are investigated respectively. Finally, the roles of the negative links and weak ties are revealed by adding them back to the giant component.

At both shopping stages, the differences in the effects of social recommendations disappear when the deals are highly scarce. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To develop the model, the Ising approach, which is a very well established framework to study the dynamics of social interactions, is employed. Furthermore, a simulation analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of two patterns and four levels of social interactions on the firm absorptive capacity. Results show that block-diagonal patterns, where interactions occur inside groups and not between groups (such as in modular organizations), lead to higher absorptive capacity, compared to hierarchical patterns (e.g., those exhibited by centralized organizations). We also show that the relationship between the level of social interactions and the firm absorptive capacity follows an inverted-U shape in the block-diagonal patterns, while the absorptive capacity decreases as the level of interactions rises, in the hierarchical patterns. Finally, we find that the social network also plays a moderating role on the relationship between the complementary knowledge and the firm absorptive capacity.",2017"Panagopoulos, Costas; Leighley, Jan E.; Hamel, Brian T.",Are Voters Mobilized by a 'Friend-and-Neighbor' on the Ballot?

Behavioral research has, however, warned that accountability, specifically a focus on being responsible for outcomes, tends to produce suboptimal judgments. We qualify this view by demonstrating the long-term adaptive benefits of outcome accountability in uncertain, dynamic environments. More than a thousand randomly assigned forecasters participated in a ten-month forecasting tournament in conditions of control, process, outcome or hybrid accountability. Accountable forecasters outperformed non-accountable ones. Holding forecasters accountable to outcomes (""getting it right"") boosted forecasting accuracy beyond holding them accountable for process (""thinking the right way""). The performance gap grew over time. Process accountability promoted more effective knowledge sharing, improving accuracy among observers. Hybrid (process plus outcome) accountability boosted accuracy relative to process, and improved knowledge sharing relative to outcome accountability. Overall, outcome and process accountability appear to make complementary contributions to performance when forecasters confront moderately noisy, dynamic environments where signal extraction requires both knowledge pooling and individual judgments.",2017"Buettner, Ricardo",Getting a job via career-oriented social networking markets,ELECTRONIC MARKETS,"While career-oriented social networking markets (CSNM) such as LinkedIn or XING are increasingly appreciated by a large number of internet users, our understanding of CSNM benefits and factors influencing the intention to use CSNM for a job search is very limited.

The evaluation of the extended model, which asks users of CSNM about their job search behavior and their search success, shows a predictive quality increase from 19.0 percent to 80.5 percent.

The Mercado del Mar, a fish market in central Mexico",PLOS ONE,"Fish consumption in Mexico is considered low (around 12 kg per person per year) and non-homogeneously distributed across the country. One of the reasons for this situation is the scarcity of wholesale selling sites. In this context, the Mercado del Mar (MM), located in Guadalajara city, Jalisco, is the second biggest wholesale fish market in Mexico, with a distribution of about 500 tons per day and a variety of about 350 different species of fish.

Specifically, the MM manages a broad and intensive interaction among business actors and the already achieved reputation allows the MM to adapt to market changes. To validate our hypotheses, an empirical study was conducted in 2015 by means of interviews to fish wholesalers in the MM and a sample of their suppliers and buyers. For simplicity we have only considered fresh water fish. We have followed snow-ball sampling as the survey strategy. Results show that the MM has responded to fish market dynamics organizing a complex network of buyers and suppliers whose relationships can be explained in the form of strong and weak ties.

High-ability workers are more productive and have a larger number of professional contacts. Firms can choose between a vacancy in the regular market and a job opening in the referral market. The model predicts that a larger number of social contacts is associated with a larger wage gap between high-and low-ability workers and a larger difference in the unemployment rates. The net welfare gain of referrals is estimated at 1.2%. There are three reasons for the inefficiency of the decentralized equilibrium. First is the traditional search externality described by Hosios. Second, firms share their profits with workers, whereas the social optimum implies that full surplus should be given to firms in the referral market. This inefficiency can be internalized by means of referral subsidies. Third, there is the ""pooling inefficiency"" in the regular market. If high-ability workers are sufficiently more productive they impose a positive externality on low-ability workers and should be rewarded by positive transfers. On the contrary, if productivity differences are small, high-ability workers achieve unreasonably high wages by referring each other and reduce employment chances of low-ability workers. In this latter case, high-ability workers should be penalized.

Employing a national survey, Study 2 finds that social media network heterogeneity and proportion of weak ties are positively associated with likelihood of incidental exposure to news online, while most variables of individual characteristics are not. The significant effects of structural factors found suggest that incidental exposure can limit consequences of selective exposure. Further implications of the findings are discussed.

An Examination of the Impact of Co-author Network on Team Knowledge Creation,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"This study aims to explore the influence of co-author network on team knowledge creation. Integrating the two traditional perspectives of network relationship and network structure, we examine the direct and interactive effects of tie stability and structural holes on team knowledge creation. Tracking scientific articles published by 111 scholars in the research field of human resource management from the top 8 American universities, we analyze scholars' scientific co-author networks. The result indicates that tie stability changes the teams' information processing modes and, when graphed, results in an inverted U-shape relationship between tie stability and team knowledge creation. Moreover, structural holes in co-author network are proved to be harmful to team knowledge sharing and diffusion, thereby impeding team knowledge creation. Also, tie stability and structural hole interactively influence team knowledge creation. When the number of structural hole is low in the co-author network, the graphical representation of the relationship between tie stability and team knowledge creation tends to be a more distinct U-shape.",2017"de Brito Silva, Marianny Jessica; da Silva, Rennaly Alves; Oliveira de Souza, Natalia Mary; Sales Melo, Francisco Vicente; de Andrade, Jackeline Amantino",THE STRENGTH OF SOCIAL TIES: DEFINITION AND PROPOSAL OF A MEASUREMENT SCALE,REVISTA ELETRONICA DE ESTRATEGIA E NEGOCIOS-REEN,"Despite the social ties play an important role in the analysis of organizational social networks, its measurement is still incipient.

Additionally, it sought to understand the social network of the researchers. In order to achieve this goal, a qualitative approach was used with the application of a survey and software implementation, which facilitated the formation of existing connections within the social network. The results revealed the existence of 10 research groups in the secretarial area. There is a propensity in strictosensu qualifications, mainly because the core activity of the group is the scientific research that therefore demands academic training to assist in group growth and team development. Moreover, drawbacks such as lacking sufficient staff, funding, and appropriate literature are current grievances. The social network showed that 61% of Executive Secretariat researchers form strong connections amongst each other and 39% form weak ties, but with potential to expand the net. In conclusion, research groups gradually increase scientific production; thus allowing the more technical activities of the secretariat to contribute to the development of epistemology.

But ultimately, networks are merely a reflection of the institutional and economic conditions of a country. This paper presents a study of business networks active in Andalusia in the period between the 1880s and 1950. First, we explain their characteristics and then reflect on their relationship with economic growth in the region. The research is based on information contained in the corporate books of business registers of Andalusia's eight provinces, to which the of social network analysis methodology has been applied. While other articles merely describe the statistical indicators of networks, here we resort to qualitative analysis thereof, as well as of the businessmen comprising them. We find two reasons why Andalusian networks were not a sufficient factor in regional development: firstly, because the networks had virtually no ""weak ties""; secondly, because they could not operate in the most dynamic sectors of the economy.",2017"Momeni, Naghmeh; Rabbat, Michael G.",Inferring Structural Characteristics of Networks With Strong and Weak Ties From Fixed-Choice Surveys,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL AND INFORMATION PROCESSING OVER NETWORKS,"Knowing the structure of an offline social network facilitates a variety of analyses, including studying the rate at which infectious diseases may spread and identifying a subset of actors to immunize in order to reduce, as much as possible, the rate of spread. Offline social network topologies are typically estimated by surveying actors and asking them to list their neighbors. While identifying close friends and family (i.e., strong ties) can typically be done reliably, listing all of one's acquaintances (i.e., weak ties) is subject to error due to respondent fatigue. This issue is commonly circumvented through the use of so-called ""fixed choice"" surveys where respondents are asked to name a fixed, small number of their weak ties (e.g., two or ten). Of course, the resulting crude observed network will omit many ties, and using this crude network to infer properties of the network, such as its degree distribution or clustering coefficient, will lead to biased estimates. This paper develops estimators, based on the method of moments, for a number of network characteristics including those related to the first and second moments of the degree distribution as well as the network size, using fixed-choice survey data. Experiments with simulated data illustrate that the proposed estimators perform well across a variety of network topologies and measurement scenarios, and the resulting estimates are significantly more accurate than those obtained directly using the crude observed network, which are commonly used in the literature. We also describe a variation of the Jackknife procedure that can be used to obtain an estimate of the estimator variance.",2017"Tumen, Semih",Career choice and the strength of weak ties,CENTRAL BANK REVIEW,"This paper argues that the structure (i.e., size and composition) of the informal search network is a crucial determinant of the career decisions of young workers. Building on the search-theoretic career choice and job mobility model proposed by Neal (1999), I compare the consequences of career advice by one's weak ties versus that by strong ties. The main result is that receiving help from weak ties is associated with early career and job settlements, while the strong ties are more likely to lead to amplified mobility and generate mismatch. Given a network size, I find a strongly positive correlation between the fraction of weak ties among one's informal connections and the likelihood of settling on a stable career path early in the life course. I also find that the sign of this correlation persists, while the magnitude gets smaller as the network size increases. I conclude that the strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis can shed light on the complexity of job mobility patterns among young workers. The model can explain why it takes much longer for blacks-whose informal networks are documented to consist of strong ties-to locate a stable career path than their white counterparts. It also predicts that young workers from closed and segregated neighborhoods tend to spend more time before they find suitable careers.

Leader-Member Exchange Moderates the Relationship Between Feedback-Seeking Behavior and Performance,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT,"Feedback is information made available to employees in their work environment, whereas feedback-seeking behaviors (FSBs) help employees to evaluate proactively whether their work has met performance standards and their behavior is considered appropriate. Prior studies have provided a perspective on how the feedback-seeking contexts affect the emergence and development of FSBs. In this study, we extend that perspective by investigating when FSBs affect job performance so that we can understand whether more feedback seeking is always better. Adopting the relational view of leadership, we hypothesize that the FSB-performance relationship should be stronger for employees with low leader-member exchange (LMX) and in groups with low aggregate LMX and low LMX differentiation. Using a multilevel research design and a sample of 379 teachers in 25 groups, we find support for most of our hypotheses.

But what characterizes this relationship? This study investigates social mechanisms explaining how social ties affect well-being through social integration and social influence, and how well-being affects social ties through social selection. We hypothesize that highly integrated individuals-those with more extensive and dense friendship networks-report higher emotional well-being than others. Moreover, emotional well-being should be influenced by the well-being of close friends. Finally, wellbeing should affect friendship selection when individuals prefer others with higher levels of well-being, and others whose well-being is similar to theirs. We test our hypotheses using longitudinal social network and well-being data of 117 individuals living in a graduate housing community. The application of a novel extension of Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models for ordered networks (ordered SAOMs) allows us to detail and test our hypotheses for weak-and strong-tied friendship networks simultaneously. Results do not support our social integration and social influence hypotheses but provide evidence for selection: individuals with higher emotional well-being tend to have more strong-tied friends, and there are homophily processes regarding emotional well-being in strong-tied networks.

While social scientists have primarily relied on survey or content analysis methodology, network scientists have used social network analysis. This research combines content analysis with the automated techniques of network analysis to determine the roles played by those using Twitter to communicate during the Turkish Gezi Park uprising. Based on a network analysis of nearly 2.4 million tweets and a content analysis of a subset of 5126 of those tweets, we found that information sharing was by far the most common use of the tweets and retweets, while tweets that indicated leadership of the movement constituted a small percentage of the overall number of tweets. Using automated techniques, we experimented with coded variables from content analysis to compute the most discriminative tokens and to predict values for each variable using only textual information. We achieved 0.61 precision on identifying types of shared information. Our results on detecting the position of user in the protest and purpose of the tweets achieved 0.42 and 0.33 precision, respectively, illustrating the necessity of user cooperation and the shortcomings of automated techniques.

In contrast, weaker ties are good enough for service provision, which creates financial benefits for PROs.

Previous research suggests that professionals would then keep users at arms' length, controlling the design and implementation of innovations internally. This study overcomes this view investigating how professional service organizations can enable users' knowledge search while controlling for the risks of inappropriateness. Combining a qualitative research on 5 innovation processes in healthcare organizations with quantitative research on 110 service users, our findings highlight that professional providers, such as senior clinicians, shaped their tactics according to the 'threats' of laggards, i.e. users searching knowledge outside of professional logics of appropriateness; more than to the opportunities of lead user communities. Professional providers sought to ""activate"" users' engagement with knowledge search by investing on their literacy, i.e. showing the basics of the logic of appropriateness informing their decision; and on trust relationships, i.e. becoming transparent on the criteria of knowledge selection during the innovation processes.

However, other studies of social networks in the labor market propose that the likelihood of information transmission might depend on strength of the tie; and that tie strength is a potentially important source of the tie's value. After all, even if job seekers have social ties to those who have valuable job information, the seekers will gain little information benefit when the ties do not actually transmit the information. This paper clarifies the conditions under which social ties might provide information benefits. We use a survey vignette experiment and ask MBA students about their likelihood of relaying job information via strong ties (to friends) or weak ties (to acquaintances), holding constant the structural locations spanned by the tie and job seekers' fit with the job. The results support the claim that strength of tie has a causal effect on the chances of information transmission: potential referrers are more likely to relay job information to their friends than to acquaintances. The larger implication of these findings is that whatever benefits there might be to using weak ties to reach distant non-redundant information during job search, these benefits need to be considered against the likely fact that people connected via weak ties are less likely to actually share information about job opportunities than are people to whom the job seeker is strongly tied.

Results support our overall model relating weak-tie interactions to generalized trust. More importantly, when we use it to compare more and less sociable Facebook users, we find meaningful differences in the strength of the relationships between variables in the model. In particular, for more sociable users, interacting with weak ties was related to greater civic participation and increased feelings of generalized trust. Access to bridging social capital was a larger source of generalized trust for more sociable users as well.

Topological differences between small-world networks and random networks are believed to be main reasons that lead to various different spreading behaviours on these two types of networks. Besides those differences, the heterogeneity of spreading abilities of network ties is often overlooked. In this study, we analyze the impacts of the heterogeneity on information spreading over small-world networks and random networks. Through simulations on both artificial and realistic networks, we find that the strong heterogeneity leads to lower efficiency of spreading over small-world networks. The heterogeneity not only slows down the spreading pace, but also lengthens the life span of the information spread over small-world networks. Under such strong heterogeneity, random networks, which are affected little, are better for information spreading. However, as the heterogeneity decreases, small-world networks finally exceed random networks when regarding information spreading. We also conduct experiments to review the weak ties assumption in small-world networks. We find that the heterogeneity forces information to bypass weak ties and travels along strongly connected nodes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Because overlapping community is one of the characteristics of real-world networks and should be considered for community detection, in this article, we propose an algorithm, called link-based label propagation algorithm (LinkLPA), to detect overlapping communities. Because the link partition is conceptually natural for the problem of overlapping community detection, LinkLPA first transforms node partition problem into link partition problem and employs a new label propagation algorithm with preference on links instead of nodes to detect communities due to the simplicity and efficiency of label propagation algorithm. Then the proposed LinkLPA performs a postprocessing to refine the detected overlapping communities by avoiding over-overlapping and incorrect partition of weak ties. Experimental results on a large number of real-world and synthetic networks show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy on detecting overlapping communities in networks.",2017"Zhu, Xiaoxuan; Dong, Maggie Chuoyan; Gu, Jibao; Dou, Wenyu",How Do Informal Ties Drive Open Innovation?

Building on both the resource-based view and the network perspective, we explore the roles of three types of informal ties (i.e., business, government, and university) in driving inbound and outbound OI, and further examine such effects contingent on market dynamism. Empirical results from our study of 260 Chinese firms show that all three types of informal ties positively affect inbound innovation openness, whereas only business ties facilitate outbound innovation openness. In addition, market dynamism strengthens the relationship between university ties and inbound innovation openness, but weakens the effect of business ties on inbound innovation openness. These findings indicate the salience of informal ties in increasing innovation openness and the contingent role of external market conditions.

Depending upon the wafer diameters, this study divided the technological development into three periods: 6 in. (1976-1991), 8 in. (1989-1999) and 12 in. (1997-2011). R&D cooperation and patent citations were used to measure the strong ties and weak ties of knowledge spillover networks. Adopting patent bibliometrics and social network analysis, this study examined main companies' network structures and channels of knowledge spillovers. Results showed that semiconductor-related knowledge spilled over more efficiently through weak ties than through strong ties. Furthermore, it was found that strong ties could be used to monitor the development of shared technologies, and weak ties could be used to monitor the development of specific technologies. During the period of the 6-inch wafer diameter, companies that had high degrees of centrality in both strong and weak ties of knowledge spillovers included: Toshiba, Mitsubishi, NEC, Hitachi and National Semi. During the period of the 8-inch wafer diameter, such companies included: STMicroelectronics, Mitsubishi, NEC, TI, Toshiba, Siemens and Philips.

Whilst linked to a political rhetoric of inclusive education such initiatives have however failed to significantly increase the number of such students entering medicine. This is compounded by a discourse that portrays WA applicants and students as lacking the essential skills or attributes to be successful in medical education. Much of the research in this area to date has been weak and it is critical to better understand how WA applicants and students negotiate medical admissions and education to inform change. To address this gap we amalgamated a larger dataset from three qualitative studies of student experiences of WA to medicine (48 participants in total). Inductively analysing the findings using social capital as a theoretical lens we created and clustered codes into categories, informed by the concepts of ""weak ties"" and ""bridging and linking capital"", terms used by previous workers in this field, to better understand student journeys in medical education. Successful applicants from lower socio-economic groups recognise and mobilise weak ties to create linking capital. However once in medical school these students seem less aware of the need for, or how to create, capital effectively.

To this end, we associate inventors with specific knowledge elements in the firm's knowledge network and examine how this association affects the inventors' popularity and activity in a work-related advice network. Empirically, we combine survey data on 135 inventors working in a German high-tech firm with information derived from the firm's 1031 patents. Results from multilevel exponential random graph models (ERGM) show that different dimensions of knowledge derived from the firm's knowledge network shape the transfer of advice among inventors in unique ways.

Each of these node-level measures can be placed on a continuum depending on whether they focus only on ego's direct contacts (e.g. degree centrality and Blau's measure of heterogeneity), or whether they also incorporate connections to others at longer distances in the network (e.g. closeness centrality or betweenness centrality). In this paper we propose generalized measures, where a tuning parameter 8 regulates the relative impact of resources held by more close versus more distant others. We first show how, when a specific 8 is chosen degree-centrality and reciprocal closeness centrality are two specific instances of this more general measure. We then demonstrate how a similar approach can be applied to node-level measures that incorporate attributes. When more or less weight is given to other nodes at longer distances with specific characteristics, a generalized measure of resource-richness and a generalized measure for diversity among one's connections can be obtained (following Blau's measure of heterogeneity). Finally, we show how this approach can also be applied to betweenness centrality to focus on more local (ego) betweenness or global (Freeman) betweenness. The importance of the choice of 8 is illustrated on some classic network datasets.

Among baboons, both increased infant survival and adult longevity have been associated with the maintenance of strong, equitable and durable social bonds. However, not all baboon populations show these patterns of bonding. South African chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, in the Drakensberg Mountains and De Hoop Nature Reserve show cyclical variation in social relations across time, with strong bonds formed only during certain times of the year. Using long-term data from the De Hoop baboons, we tested whether social relations influence female reproductive success in our study group in a manner similar to other baboon populations. Our results show that the number of strong bonds a female maintained predicted birth rate, and that the number of weak bonds a female possessed predicted infant 12-month survival and infant longevity. Fitness-related benefits of sociability were, however, independent of female dominance rank, and there was no relationship between the number of weak and strong bonds a female maintained. One possible explanation for the influence of weak as well as strong bonds in our study group may be that variation in demographic and ecological conditions across populations may favour the use of different social strategies by females. In our sample, weak bonds as well as strong bonds appear to be instrumental to achieving fitness-related benefits. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

However, diversity may not always be advantageous. Drawing from literature on entrepreneurial opportunities, social network theory, and cognitive psychology, it is argued in this paper that the level of diversity in entrepreneurial strategic networks differs based on the nature of the entrepreneurial opportunity context discovery or creation. Competing hypotheses are developed for the nature of strategic networks in the discovery and creation opportunity contexts. The results from our two studies (using PSED II dataset and data collected from women entrepreneurs in India) show that entrepreneurial strategic networks differ based on whether entrepreneurs are pursuing discovery or creation opportunities, i.e., entrepreneurs operating in 'discovery' contexts tend to use networks ties with individuals who are relatively similar to themselves, while entrepreneurs in 'creation' contexts tend to use network ties with individuals who are relatively different from themselves. Further, the results also show that the diversity in strategic networks is not unidirectional in discovery and/or creation contexts but varies depending on the specific matters for which the entrepreneur seeks advice.

Unlike previous studies that focus solely on income, this paper pays more heed to job satisfaction. Based on data drawn from China General Social Survey, we find that disadvantaged job seekers rely primarily on informal channels; whereas experienced and better-educated job seekers tend to search for jobs through formal channels. However, those reaping the largest benefit from using networks are the job seekers who are able to use formal and informal channels jointly. By disaggregating the whole sample, we further find that the promoting effect of network use is contingent on factors such as gender and types of jobs. Network use brings about larger benefits to female and job seekers target to prestigious occupations. Finally, it appears that whether a job seeker can receive influential help depends primarily on the social status of the contacts rather than their tie strength. The results of our paper thus urge us to examine the combination of different searching strategies rather than studying them separately. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The social information (i.e., social ties and social influence) of the members that is stored in online social networks provides a new perspective for investigating group decision-making (GDM) problems. In this paper, a new interactive GDM approach, based on online social networks, is proposed to address a ranking problem with incomplete additive preference relations (IAPRs). This approach incorporates the strength of social ties and social influence calculated by social network analysis methods regarding the decision-making process. After decision makers (DMs) provide IAPRs, a searching algorithm is developed to identify the optimal preference information transfer path from DMs to the decision supporters who can provide the corresponding preference information. Next, a linear programming model is constructed to complete the missing preference values of the IAPRs. The main features of the linear programming model include its ability to account for other DMs' preference information and to maintain consistency. To help the group reach an agreement on the ranking of alternatives, a consensus reaching process is proposed. The strength of social ties and social influence are used to calculate the acceptable adjustment coefficients for DMs in the feedback mechanism. Finally, an illustrative example and further discussion demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

When opinion leaders advocate or adopt a best practice, others adopt too, resulting in diffusion. We sought to identify existing influence throughout Canada's longterm care sector and the extent to which informal advice-seeking relationships tie the sector together as a network. Methods: We conducted a sociometric survey of senior leaders in 958 long-term care facilities operating in 11 of Canada's 13 provinces and territories. We used an integrated knowledge translation approach to involve knowledge users in planning and administering the survey and in analyzing and interpreting the results. Responses from 482 senior leaders generated the names of 794 individuals and 587 organizations as sources of advice for improving resident care in long-term care facilities. Results: A single advice-seeking network appears to span the nation. Proximity exhibits a strong effect on network structure, with provincial inter-organizational networks having more connections and thus a denser structure than interpersonal networks. We found credible individuals and organizations within groups (opinion leaders and opinionleading organizations) and individuals and organizations that function as weak ties across groups (boundary spanners and bridges) for all studied provinces and territories. A good deal of influence in the Canadian long-term care sector rests with professionals such as provincial health administrators not employed in long-term care facilities. Conclusions: The Canadian long-term care sector is tied together through informal advice-seeking relationships that have given rise to an emergent network structure.

This approach is then supplemented with meta-regression that examines the extent to which those network features are associated with organizational inequality (the wage gap between supervisors and non-supervisors).

Rather, they often persist through technology-mediated communications in ways that result in, at minimum, the development of weak ties. This greater relationship persistence can permit more opportunity to get to know a potential partner in digitally mediated settings like Facebook or via texting, but it could also require newstrategies to evade interested others given this new lack of ephemerality and the influx of weak ties.",2017"Bervoets, Sebastian; Zenou, Yves",Intergenerational correlation and social interactions in education,EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,"We propose a dynastic model where individuals are born into an educated or uneducated environment that they inherit from their parents.

When the level of social interactions is decided by a social planner, we show that the correlation in education status between generations decreases very fast as social interactions increase. In turn, when the level of social interactions is decided by the individuals themselves, we show that the intergenerational correlation still decreases, although less rapidly than with exogenous social interactions.",2017"Olaisen, Johan; Revang, Oivind",Working smarter and greener: Collaborative knowledge sharing in virtual global project teams,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,"The purpose of this study is to explore how to facilitate the sharing of high-quality knowledge in a virtual global project team context. The most obvious finding from this study is that we can develop social interaction building up trust and share knowledge through online technology platforms without offline social interaction. The design and methodology are case studies of four Scandinavian virtual global project teams with a total of 42 team members. The survey is a longitude study in 2014-16 based upon 168 individual reports and 16 in-depth top leader interviews. Working smarter means using technology platforms for developing trust and knowledge collaboration to deliver business solutions and innovations. Working smarter mean to work in a global project team where the collaboration results develop the team into a high-performance team. Working more intelligent is sharing knowledge to improve innovation and collective and individual competence growth. Understanding that investment in top technology solutions are inexpensive compared to the results delivered by professional human resources. Working greener means to let the team members be aware of green solutions and innovations. Working greener means to travel less using the possibilities given by social technology platforms. The four teams reduced the number of trips by 50-70%. The result is less airline pollution, less stress, and more professional work. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Data were collected from 120 teams engaged in a 4-month business simulation. Relationship conflicts occurring among team members who are friends have a negative impact on team performance, whereas those occurring between non-friends have a positive impact on team performance. Although we also find non-friend task conflicts to be beneficial for team performance, friend task conflicts have no impact on team performance. This study highlights the dark side of workplace friendships and admonishes managers to pay close attention not only to conflicts among employees, but also to the relational closeness of those involved in conflict. The current study provides empirical support for the emerging conflict involvement perspective by explicitly assessing the number of individuals involved in conflict as well as the type of relationships between them. We also extend research on multiplex relationships from the individual to the team level of analysis.

Extending prior research into networks and exploration, we propose that a key characteristic of managers' external networks - the extent to which their networks include relationships built using predominately individual rather than firm resources - is positively related to managers' abilities to explore for new business and knowledge in large firms. We propose that networks with more individual ties provide more diverse knowledge, enable greater autonomy and ease access to resources from contacts, hence facilitating exploration. Analysis of an original dataset of external networks of 77 senior managers in a large global consulting firm provides support for our arguments. We find that individual ties are positively related to exploration and, furthermore, that the positive (negative) relationship between sparse (dense) networks and exploration increases with the number of individual ties in managers' networks.",2017"Monteiro, Felipe; Birkinshaw, Julian",THE EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE SOURCING PROCESS IN MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS,STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,"Research summary: We study the processes through which multinational corporations (MNCs) identify and make use of external sources of knowledge. Based on a seven-year longitudinal study of one MNC's overseas scouting unit, we show how a simple one-directional ""channelling"" process gradually gave way to three higher value-added processes, labelled ""translating,"" ""matchmaking,"" and ""transforming."" Building on these insights, we develop an integrative framework, defining the conditions under which each of the four processes is likely to transpire, and showing how the stock of social capital held by the scouting unit allows it to perform increasingly high value-added activities over time. Implications for the MNC, external knowledge sourcing, and boundary-spanning literatures are discussed. Managerial summary: Over the years, many multinational corporations (MNCs) have created overseas ""scouting"" units to tap into new ideas and opportunities in leading-edge markets, but with mixed outcomes. In this study, we describe the development of a European telecom firm's scouting unit in Silicon Valley during the 2000s, focusing on the specific approaches used by the scouting managers to build effective connections between Silicon Valley start-ups and the firm's business units back in Europe. We identify four distinct approaches for different types of opportunities, and we observe a clear sequencing of effort over time as the scouting managers built the necessary capabilities and credibility.

Accordingly, we explored inter-individual variations of functional connectivity dynamics, subnetwork patterns and modular architecture while subjects watched identical video clips designed to induce different arousal levels. How inter-individual variations are manifested in the functional brain networks was examined with respect to four contrasting divisions: edges within the anterior versus posterior part of the brain, edges with versus without corresponding anatomically-defined structural pathways, inter-versus intra-module connections, and rich club edge types. Inter-subject variation in dynamic functional connectivity occurred to a greater degree within edges localized to anterior rather than posterior brain regions, without adhering to structural connectivity, between modules as opposed to within modules, and in weak-tie local edges rather than strong-tie rich-club edges. Arousal level significantly modulates inter-subject variability in functional connectivity, edge patterns, and modularity, and particularly enhances the synchrony of rich-club edges.

From both the theoretical and empirical points of view, this increased attention has generated many inconsistencies. In this article we propose that a conceptualization of the idea journey encompassing phases that the literature has so far overlooked can help solve existing tensions. We conceptualize four phases of the journey of an idea, from conception to completion: idea generation, idea elaboration, idea championing, and idea implementation. We propose that a creator has distinct primary needs in each phase: cognitive flexibility, support, influence, and shared vision, respectively. Individual creators successfully move through a phase when the relational and structural elements of their networks match the distinct needs of the phase. The relational and structural elements that are beneficial for one phase, however, are detrimental for another. We propose that in order to solve this seeming contradiction and the associated paradoxes, individual creators have to change interpretations and frames throughout the different phases. This, in turn, allows them to activate different network characteristics at the appropriate moment and successfully complete the idea journey from novel concept to a tangible outcome that changes the field.",2017"Ruan, Aijun; Chen, Jin","Does formal knowledge search depth benefit Chinese firms' innovation performance? Effects of network centrality, structural holes, and knowledge tacitness",ASIAN JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION,"Accessing external knowledge is an important factor in successful innovation. Knowledge search is an issue of concern for Chinese firms because many firms generally have relatively weak research and development (R&D) and innovation capabilities that cannot support innovative development through mere internal innovations. This study examines the interactive effects of network centrality, structural holes, and knowledge tacitness when formal knowledge search depth (FKSD) affects innovation performance from the perspective of formal/informal knowledge search. A survey of 161 firms in China suggests that FKSD positively affects innovation performance, and the effect is positively moderated by network centrality. Given high knowledge tacitness, FKSD is more effective in fostering innovation performance when firms' network centrality is higher. Furthermore, high knowledge tacitness results in rich structural holes negatively moderating the effect of FKSD on innovation performance, whereas low tacitness generates a positive moderating role. This indicates that Chinese firms may consider using more formal search channels to increase external knowledge search depth and to dynamically adjust the depth of such a formal search or the mode of network structural embeddedness according to the degree of knowledge tacitness.",2017"Ingold, Karin",How to create and preserve social capital in climate adaptation policies: A network approach,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,"The processes and impacts of climate change require adaptation through what can be described as horizontal and vertical structures of actors' integration. In climate adaptation and natural resource management literature, this structural component is often related to social capital, which is defined in various ways but usually refers to a public good that is built and fostered within a network of social relations. While hypotheses about social capital in networks are well studied in network literature, here, I argue that they should be reflected and tested in the particular context of climate change adaptation policy. I ask: how do communities affected by climate change and the broad range of actors involved in the design of climate adaptation policies build social relationships? And, how do they manage to maintain those relations over time? To answer these questions, climate adaptation policies in six Swiss mountain regions are investigated via social network analysis. Hypotheses about the creation and preservation of weak versus strong ties under the particular setting of Swiss federalism and climate-affected local communities are tested. Results confirm that the creation of weak ties, such as one-way information transfer, can lead to the establishment of mutual collaboration relations over time. Such mutual and reciprocal relations can then more easily be activated by local communities to produce both short-term responses and long-term solutions to climate change impacts.

Much of project knowledge is tacit, residing in social interactions in team relationships, and likely to be disseminated through social networks and processes within organisations. Social capital comprises both the network of strong personal relationships and the knowledge resources that may be mobilised through that network. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of ""networks"" in disseminating project knowledge within the construction organisations in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach - The case study research method was used to investigate the research problem. The principal data collection technique used was semi-structured interviews. Content analysis, tables and cognitive maps were used to analyse data. Findings - The findings revealed that strong network ties created with equal interaction of project and head office (H/O) individuals, frequent connectivity and much closer relationships enhance the flexibility of sharing project knowledge. The available invisible informal social networks within project and H/O individuals play a key role in disseminating project knowledge compared to business networks.

Most existing accuracy measures do not consider the role of time evolution within the network. Moreover, almost all existing methods use indirect links to infer and evaluate the validity of links. We introduce time as a parameter for link prediction accuracy measures, and we modify the structure of the link prediction algorithms to exploit information of the known direct links for link prediction. We find that the direct link algorithm performs better than the indirect link algorithm for a range of time varying networks. We show that the network structure plays a more important role than weights for links prediction. In addition, our analysis finds that the number of common neighbours also plays an important role for the so-called weak-ties phenomenon.

In particular, the authors aim to answer the following research questions: how do dyadic and network relationships contribute to inter-organizational creation and transfer of knowledge? More specifically, which joint activities between organizations facilitate inter-organizational learning within a knowledge network? That is, the authors are interested in the relationship processes for inter-organisational learning, aiming to identify and understand the joint activities through which organizations within an institutional network generate and transfer knowledge. Design/methodology/approach - Aiming at studying how six institutional actors generate and transfer knowledge, the existing dyadic relationships between a focal actor (a technological center of the textile and clothing industry - CITEVE) and each one of the other five institutional actors were studied. In the study of this knowledge network the authors analyzed several documental sources and carried out 19 interviews. Findings - This study shows how dyadic and network relationships contribute to inter-organisational creation and transfer of knowledge. It assesses several joint activities through which organizations in the studied network learn with each other and compares the five dyadic relationships in terms of their distinctive features. Through the cooperative effort based on joint activities between actors, the studied network generates complementary and multidisciplinary knowledge aiming to promote network learning of the studied organizations. Management implications and suggestions for further research on network learning are discussed. Originality/value - This paper adds to the literature on network learning and management by empirically illustrating how a network of organizations in a given industry contributes to knowledge generation. It is an original contribution because, first, it allows a better understanding of how organizations of a knowledge network interact and contribute for network learning.

The traditional definitions of strong ties (with two endpoints in the same community) and weak ties (with two endpoints in different communities) are being challenged by overlapping community structures. Because of their unique nature, the relationships between overlapping nodes and non-overlapping nodes are difficult to classify as strong or weak. In view of this, it is here proposed that the coefficient indicator for overlapping communities was used to redefine node relationships and enable the quantification of strong and weak ties. Next, changes in the quantities of strong and weak ties were analyzed by varying the threshold values of the overlap coefficient. Finally, the effect of weak ties in information dissemination was assessed in overlapping and non-overlapping situations, respectively. Results demonstrated that the overlap coefficient proposed in this paper could better characterize the strong and weak attributes of edges under overlapping community structures.",2017"Wang, Xiaoyan; Bao, Haijun",Alliance portfolios and firm performance: the moderating role of environmental dynamics,INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on the operation strategy of high-performance alliance portfolios by analyzing the effect of alliance portfolios on the performance of focal firms, using post-structuralism of social network theory and contingency theory. In detail, this paper refines alliance portfolios into three dimensions, and studies the moderating role of context on the relation between alliance portfolios and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical study was carried out with second-hand data gathered from Internal Revenue Service. In total, this paper gathered data from 506 focal firms in Zhejiang Province from 2001 to 2010 as the sample to test the hypotheses. Findings - Based on the empirical results, the authors find the positive effect of relational dimension (weak alliance portfolios) and partner dimension (the diversity of partners) on performance. The effect of the former will become weaker with the increasing environmental dynamic, while the effect of the latter will become stronger. However, the structural dimension (alliance portfolios size) and relational dimension (new partners) have the negative effect on performance. And the negative effect will become stronger under high environmental dynamic. Moreover, the negative effect of non-local partners on performance becomes stronger when the environmental dynamic is high. Research limitations/implications - The paper reveals that with the industry transformation caused by ""internet +,"" companies have been required go beyond traditional dyadic alliance management perspective. That is to say, individual alliance relationship should be seen as a part of a much broader picture of alliance portfolio. As such, the framework may help companies to manage their alliance portfolios by matching high-performance alliance portfolios to the external environment to produce a synergistic effect (Lea et al., 2006; Tritos et al., 2013; Keith et al., 2014) taking the characteristics of the configuration of alliance portfolios into consideration.

Based on the assumption that entrepreneurs learn from networks, the purpose of this paper is to examine which types of difficulties encourage entrepreneurs to use networks to facilitate learning, whether entrepreneurs change networks to deal with such difficulties, and which network characteristics facilitate learning. Design/methodology/approach - Networks are considered a potential source of learning, namely, the cognitive process of acquiring and structuring knowledge, creating meaning from experience and generating new solutions from existing knowledge. Through networks, entrepreneur share information and discuss opportunities and problems. Using an innovative approach combining story telling and network mapping, this study analyses how entrepreneurs use networks in learning. The data collected from six entrepreneurs working in knowledge-intensive sectors enables examining the learning process ensuing from the interactions between entrepreneurs and their contacts. Findings - The findings show that entrepreneurs construct different types of networks in response to their difficulties, not in relation to products or technologies, but to learn to overcome self-crises, external threats, management and organisational issues. The findings reveal that entrepreneurs develop networks dominated by strong ties for exploitative learning and networks dominated by weak ties for explorative learning.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of breadth, depth and partner newness on product innovativeness and product competitive advantage. The authors also seek to examine the contingent effects of the appropriability regime. The authors make suggestions to academics and practitioners based on the findings. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use a structured survey instrument producing an empirical analysis of 205 NPD projects in the manufacturing sector in the UK. The authors use an ordinary least squares regression model to test hypothesised relationships between openness (breadth, depth and partner newness), product innovativeness, product competitive advantage and the appropriability regime. Findings - The authors find that each of the three dimensions of openness, depth, breadth and partner newness, have a significant but differing impact on product innovativeness. Specifically, the study indicates that breadth has a positive effect but only in the presence of a strong appropriability regime, partner newness has a direct positive effect, and depth a direct negative effect. The authors also find that product innovativeness has a positive impact on product competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications - Further research should focus on replicating the findings in other countries, search for further moderating factors, such as the stage of the NPD process, and analyse the longitudinal impact of openness within NPD projects. Practical implications - Organisations are encouraging managers to be more open in their approach to NPD. The authors' findings suggest that managers need to think about the three dimensions of openness, breadth, depth and partner newness. Their engagement with each of these dimensions depends on the desired outcomes of the innovation project and the strength of patents. Originality/value - The research extends the extant supplier involvement in new product development literature to examine the effect of up to 11 types of external actor in NPD projects.

Prior research often treats KT processes as a firm-level capability, assuming knowledge flows uniformly within a firm. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether such a view is too simplistic because it ignores potential differences between inter-group and intra-group KT processes within a firm. Design/methodology/approach - The authors surveyed 137 software development professionals in a large Japanese electronics firm regarding co-workers who acted as critical sources of useful knowledge and the factors that affected KT within and across internal organizational boundaries. Using regression analysis, the authors test the extent to which factors such as the characteristics of the knowledge, the characteristics of the tie, and the characteristics of the network differentially affect KT within internal organizational boundaries vs across them. Findings - The authors find that factors such as the accessibility of the knowledge source, network density, and collective teaching all help in transferring knowledge, while knowledge tacitness inhibit such transfers, but that the effect of these properties varies significantly depending on whether KT occurs across group boundaries. Originality/value - Existing research on KT within firms tends to treat all such transfers as uniform, with little difference between the dynamics of within-group transfer and between-group transfer. This study establishes key differences in KT between and within organizational groups, demonstrating that managers need to consider internal boundaries when deploying tools and strategies for facilitating knowledge flows.",2017"Hautz, Julia",Opening up the strategy process - a network perspective,MANAGEMENT DECISION,"Purpose - While strategy was traditionally perceived as exclusive, and limited to small groups within organizations, recently a shift toward greater openness through inclusion of a larger number and variety of actors is emerging. The purpose of this paper is to adopt a social network perspective to develop a theoretical framework on how this increased openness has a varying impact in the different phases of the strategy process. Design/methodology/approach - The author suggests that the strategy process is shaped through social interactions between individuals. Specifically the author conceptualizes how introducing openness affects individuals' structural and relational characteristics, which impact generating new strategic ideas (variation), and selecting (selection), and integrating them into the existing set of routines (retention). Findings - The framework shows that benefits and costs of increased openness balance differently. While substantial benefits may be realized in the idea generation phase, costs may outweigh the benefits in the selection and retention phase. Practical implications - Based on the framework, implications can be drawn on how openness should be introduced in the different phases of the strategy process. Specifically the author discusses appropriate open strategy tools based on social technologies, which organizations can use to benefit from openness in the different stages. Originality/value - Open strategy is a newly emerging phenomenon, which seems to fundamentally change the strategist's work.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors have conducted a survey among Chinese manufacturers in four industries (textile and garment, household appliance, IT and electronics and motor vehicle assemblers) that are located in North, East, Central and South China, respectively, with a valid response from 278 manufacturers. Structural equation model is used to analyze the results. Findings - This study demonstrates that in Chinese Manufacturing industry, tie strength is positively related to innovation performance. The authors also find that absorptive capacity has a positive impact on innovation performance and it mediates the relationship between tie strength and innovation performance. Then, the authors analyze the effect of ownership, industry and sub-region, and the results show that in private firms and traditional manufacturers, and the firms located in North and Eastern China, tie strength has no direct effect on innovation outcomes, but it can influence innovation indirectly through absorptive capacity. Originality/value - This study further supports that in Chinese guanxi culture, strong ties with other innovation partners can improve the firm's absorptive capacity and thus improve innovation performance.

This research aims to find the role of social media usage in promoting effective communication and enhancing group task performance. What is more, to give implications on a better grouping method, we utilized the concept of tie strength (in a typical social network) in the current research. We proposed that the tie strength among university students negatively moderates the relationship between social media usage and communication. The social constructivism theory was employed as a major theoretical foundation, built on which a research model was developed. The model was tested via 135 senior-year undergraduates in one of the diversified classes. The data analysis results revealed that social media usage promotes communication in group; tie strength in the social network group negatively influences group communication. This means, contrary to our natural assumption, the closer the relationship is among group members, the less likely communication would happen in the group. Our research gave implications on pedagogy in that it extended our understanding of the project-based learning in small teams supported by interactions via social media. It also contributed to the grouping strategies of the classes that rely heavily on the group discussion via social media.",2017"Schneckenreither, Guenter; Popper, Niki",DYNAMIC MULTIPLEX SOCIAL NETWORK MODELS ON MULTIPLE TIME SCALES FOR SIMULATING CONTACT FORMATION AND PATTERNS IN EPIDEMIC SPREAD,2017 WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE (WSC),"This contribution presents a model for dynamic networks of physical contacts among large populations and their application for reproducing complex patterns in epidemic spread. The networks are constructed from statistical data on demography, geography, organizational structure and contact behavior. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the data and by construction, rich topological characteristics such as overlapping communities, layering along multiple dimensions and multiplex dynamics on different time scales can be observed. The generated dynamic networks can furthermore be regarded as subgraphs or derivatives of latent social networks. General results and observations form social network theory apply naturally and are used for explaining dynamic effects in epidemics. An exemplaric analysis investigates the impact of weak ties and effects of communities with decreased immunization on epidemic spread. Optimized implementation and visualization techniques turn out to be a key asset for dynamic simulation of contacts within large populations.",2017"Kuschminder, Katie",Reintegration Strategies,REINTEGRATION STRATEGIES: CONCEPTUALIZING HOW RETURN MIGRANTS REINTEGRATE,,2017"Fojs, Ivana; Vukovic, Ksenija; Detelj, Kristina",IMPACT OF SOCIAL CAPITAL ON THE GENERATION OF ECONOMIC CAPITAL IN CREATIVE INDUSTRIES,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT (ESD 2017),"The aim of this paper is to identify the forms of entrepreneurs' social capital in cultural and creative industries and to examine the impact of social capital on generating and increasing the entrepreneurs' economic capital. Due to the different approaches to the concept of social capital and the many definitions of social capital, there is a vague understanding of the concept. Thus, the theoretical framework of this work relies on Bourdieu's theory of practice and its definition of social capital. The research adopts a qualitative approach by using the method of phenomenological interviewing. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted on a sample of ten entrepreneurs in the Northwest Croatia. The research material was analysed by coding technique. In the first stage of the analysis of empirical material, open coding is performed. In the second stage, focused coding is performed. Research results show the diversity of strong and weak ties that represent a significant resource for entrepreneurs in creative and cultural industries.

Existing researches on collaborative development are mainly based on methodology of non-weighted static network, and assume that innovative search is independent with knowledge transfer and knowledge creation. This paper, based on scale-free network, establishes a new model to more precisely describe the process and behaviors of collaborative development for complex equipment, which includes innovation search, knowledge transfer and knowledge creation. By using simulation modeling, this paper investigates the dynamic mechanism of knowledge growth in the collaborative network, and probes the impact of innovation search on the performance of the collaborative development network. It is found that different strategies of innovation search have almost the same evolution path in the collaborative development network, and a similar equilibrium will be reached no matter what kind of search strategy is used. There is an inverted U-shape relationship between the tie density and the average knowledge stock (AKS) in the collaborative network, whereas network relation strength is positively correlated with the AKS. It is proved that strategies of innovation search significantly influence the AKS and the level of knowledge innovation in collaborative development environment.",2017"Torro, O.; Gupta, J.

Measuring the tie strength in social networks has been an important topic for academic studies since Mark Granovetter's seminal papers in 1970' s. However, it is still a problematic issue mainly for two reasons: 1) existing tie strength measurements may not reflect the true social connections of individuals accurately enough, and 2) many different methods to gather data from social media are not applicable anymore due to different data openness issues. In addition, we have only little empirical knowledge of the actual tie strengthening process in online social networks. Therefore, we suggest a new approach to tie strength research, which focuses on studying communication patterns (edges) more rather than actors (nodes) in a social network. In this paper we build a social network analysis-based approach to enable the evaluation of tie strength based on reciprocal interaction from publicly available Facebook data, and suggest that this approach could work as a basis for further tie strength studies. Our approach makes use of weak tie theory, and enables researchers to study micro-level interactions (i. e. discussions, messages, relationships) with large-scale social network analysis (SNA). This study provides a way to find relevant actors from publicly available data in the context of tie strengthening process, and answers how to take this stream of research closer to computational social science.",2017"Zhang, Boyang; Karkkainen, Hannu; Gupta, Jayesh Prakash; Menon, Karan",The Role of Weak Ties in Enhancing Knowledge Work,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 21ST INTERNATIONAL ACADEMIC MINDTREK CONFERENCE (ACADEMIC MINDTREK),"The purpose of this research paper is to explore the collaboration in knowledge worker's performance from the organizational perspective and decompose most relevant contributing factors.

A Theoretical Debate,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE, POLICY AND GOVERNANCE STUDIES (ICAS-PGS 2017) AND THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY (ICBAP 2017)","Social capital plays a significant role in utilizing the flow of information. Generally, social capital can be generated by establishing a close relationship between many people in order to create mutual trust. However the structural holes theory instead sees otherwise, high social capital can only be obtained through a sparse relationship. Based on that theoretical perspective, this paper aims to describe and elaborate these two opposing views. Therefore, the author conducted a literature review of nine previous studies. This paper concludes that the structural holes theory is also a form of social capital. Furthermore, this theory is interdependent and complementary to the theory of network closure. The intermediary must combine weak ties with strong ties simultaneously to gain maximum benefits of information and control. He/she should reach out various kinds of relationships between others different groups to generate diverse information (non-redundant) that used to create a good idea. At the same time, the intermediary also needs to maintain and/or enhance the strength of trust or closure in the existing ties in order to distribute the idea because it potentially can increase the adoption of the idea.

Participation in both the types of organization allows members to start new social relations. However, social welfare associations seem to play a significantly greater role in the development of volunteers' social capital, favouring the creation of weak ties that are used to exchange information and advice, and offering the opportunity to establish stronger ties entailing concrete mutual support. Within social cooperatives, workers appear to develop their individual social capital to a greater extent than volunteers. Our results suggest that the composition of the workforce, the depth of members' involvement in the organization's activities and the human resources strategies adopted by the management influence the creation of cooperative relations through on-the-job interactions.",2017"Gundolf, Katherine; Cesinger, Beate; Geraudel, Mickael; Filser, Matthias","Strong ties, personality, and legitimacy of entrepreneurs: the case of private physicians",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURING,"Legitimacy is crucial for entrepreneurs. It is the cornerstone for creating relationships with stakeholders and mitigating resource constraints. But, other-referent legitimacy is also related to the cognitive image of individual legitimacy. Drawing on the identity-based model of legitimacy, we argue that personality traits (big five) and social capital (strong ties) of entrepreneurs impact self-perceived legitimacy of entrepreneurs. Based on survey data of 98 German private physicians, this paper examines antecedents of self-perceived legitimacy towards two main stakeholders: patients and peers. We find that high levels of agreeableness stimulate self-perceived legitimacy towards patients and peers, whereas openness to experience solely influences physicians' self-perceived legitimacy towards patients. In addition, our results highlight the contingent effect of personality traits by underlining the role of strong ties as a moderator of the relationship between personality traits and self-perceived legitimacy. By identifying these configurations we contribute to the literature on entrepreneurship with a refined perspective of antecedents of self-perceived legitimacy. Moreover, we give recommendations on how private physicians can benefit from two personality traits - agreeableness and openness to experience - and how they can manage weak and strong ties in order to diffuse their reputation.",2017Zhang Liming; Yang Jie; Zhou Rui,Research on the Mechanism of Knowledge Transfer on the Performance of Enterprise Management Innovation,"NEW THINKING FOR STRATEGY: GREEN, INNOVATION AND SHARING","Knowledge is the source of innovation.

This study aims to fill this gap. It draws its data from two ethnographic studies of school place allocation in two Chinese cities during 2012 and 2013, and additional post-fieldwork in 2014. The research finds that the use of interaction rituals in la guanxi could be a profitable social investment, and that the interaction ritual chain is usually more powerful than a single instance of ritual. Instrumental li is the shared value behind this type of ritual practice, which has the function of exaggerating the actors' moral obligation and emotional attachment, and masking rational calculation, in order to justify the practice. Expressive ritual is less valued, and occurs less frequently, with distance. Instrumental ritual is more workable and occurs more frequently in moderate guanxi (a relationship neither close nor distant) than in close and distant guanxi, thus following a weak-strong-weak pattern. These findings suggest that instrumental ritual plays a more important role than expressive ritual in building strong social capital, due to the strength of weak ties.",2017"Fukugawa, Nobuya",Is the performance improvement effect of social capital contingent on life cycle stages of professional athletes?

Assortative, relational, and proximity mechanisms are the recognized social processes that are responsible for the formation of these dyadic ties. In this paper, we develop an agent-based model that derives its essence from social processes, fuzzy game theory, and social network analysis. The process of dyadic friendship formation depends on the agent's (participant's) spatial configuration, attributes affecting friendship, and interaction with other agents. To model these interactions, we use fuzzy iterated prisoner's dilemma (Fuzzy-IPD) utilizing the decision factors contributing to similar social processes. These strategies have been independently discussed in previously published studies. We, however, use them in combination to design a descriptive model with different experimental settings in an ad-hoc simulation framework. Using an integrationist approach, we blend multiple individual components of friendship formation to construct a comprehensive model. The analysis of the model thus developed reveals a possible interaction pattern responsible for the evolution of the layered associations.

The theory was applied to a case study on participation in leisure activity in the United States with data from the Personal Networks and Community Survey. The size of the respondents' core networks and the diversity of their contacts were found to be correlated positively with the variety and frequency of their activities. In addition, endogeneity because of correlations between network diversity and social personalities was accounted for with a two-step estimation procedure. The results showed that inclusion of a count of strong ties and the diversity of weak ties significantly increased the model fit and supported the theory's hypothesis.

To conduct this study, the research team analysed a data-set of 10,849 knowledge sharing dyads reported through a survey administered in one department in a large construction and engineering organization. Data were analysed using social network analysis and multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure. Results showed that stronger connections were assessed as more beneficial for time savings, especially when the connections were with central actors who had higher closeness centrality scores. Knowledge seekers also had a higher assessment of time savings when they were closer (in terms of network distance) to the knowledge provider.

As of 2016, Facebook had over 1.65 billion users. SNS is known for challenging conventional connotations of friendship by lumping all of one's social connections, including remote acquaintances, into one uniform friend category. Research suggests that social search is the future of online search and social search is seen as the online search for persons or information on persons. Based on only the structure of SNS, this paper devises a couple of exploration techniques to predict what strategies users are going to make friends on SNS in mobile environment. Essentially, there are two strategies for making friends on SNS in mobile environment: random and non-random (friends of friends) strategies. The non-random strategy means that new friends are selected in a friends-of-friends manner. Each SNS user can select randomly chosen target user, or neighbourhood search is done to develop a social network. This study develops logit models to capture the characteristics of these choice strategies. We conduct a series of experiments related to Facebook membership. Visualising how users are linked together or not is accessible via the Facebook application programming interface (API), so that we could crawl their Facebook accounts and extract their friends' data and access all their information under their agreement. In this study we obtained the users' permission to install an application within their accounts. The study analyses 226 Facebook users who totally have 37,571 friends and 607,802 relationships. The results significantly show that the number of individuals' friends, the value of closeness function, the betweenness value, and the clustering coefficient are the four important factors when an individual makes friends on Facebook. The accuracy of our models predicting the random or non-random strategies for making friends on Facebook is 84.5%.

Recent information and communication technology-driven developments like crowdsourcing or social networks have opened up new organizational possibilities for emergency managers. To make quick but solid decisions, and improve the coordination of activities performed by crowdsourcees during disaster response, the authors suggest the use of collaborative features from crowdsourcing and inherent availability of resources from social network effects. In this paper, the idea of considering collaboration and crowdsourcing as drivers for flexibility in the design of business processes in the context of emergency management is prepared, the meaning of location- dependent tasks for volunteers is investigated, and the added value of social network effects is substantiated. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is part of an ongoing research project in the field of crowdsourcing. It represents conceptual work that builds on relevant literature. Findings - In terms of emergency management, the paper sheds light on what emergency managers may consider when coordinating activities performed by volunteers and how they may benefit from social network effects. Furthermore, it is shown how they can exploit information using collaboration- based and tournamentlike crowdsourcing, how they can benefit from invoking additional resources using weak ties from social networks, and how visualization of information may support decision-making. Practical implications - Exemplary applications to exploit crowdsourcing and social network effects to support improvisation and to respond flexibly in disaster response are given.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which social capital in the form of strong ties with family and friends is associated with enhanced employment outcomes for persons with childhood-onset disabilities. Design/methodology/approach - Questioning the current theoretical consensus that strong social ties are unimportant to employment quality, the authors draw on disability research and opportunity, motivation and ability social capital theory to propose a model of the impact of strong ties with family and friends on paid-work-hours and skill-utilization as well as the potential moderating role of gender and disability severity. The authors then test this model using data from 1,380 people with childhood-onset disabilities and OLS regression analysis. Findings - As theorized, family-of-origin-size is positively associated with hours worked. Family-of-originsize is also associated with having more close friends and children. These strong ties, in turn, are positively associated with hours worked.

This study relies on a lexicographic analysis to produce quantitative results which are then analysed qualitatively with the help of extracts from semi-structured interviews with francophone rappers. The analysis focuses on tracks from different generations of rappers and also a single artist throughout his career, Akhenaton. The initial quantitative results will lead to discussions of the impact of the beginnings of French rap in comparison to the wide acceptance and success of French rap nowadays. The effect of life experiences will also be taken into consideration to observe how much vocabulary can change throughout an individual's life as he or she goes through various life-changing events. These discussions will be linked to the effects of strong- and weak-ties relationships on language change as well as the impact of increasing fame, changes in social class and the advent of the Internet. This article concludes that the different generations of rappers displayed a marked increase in non-standard language use with time, whereas Akhenaton's non-standard language use fluctuated much more.

Design/methodology/approach - A 2 x 2 x 2 mixed design is used. Temporal distance (near vs distant) and message concreteness (text vs picture) are between-subjects factors; sharing intentions (close friends vs general public) is a within-subjects factor. Findings - Findings indicate that consumers are more likely to share promotional messages with their strong rather than weak ties. If they perceive that purchases will occur soon, concrete promotional messages will more strongly motivate them to share the message with their friends. However, if they perceive that purchases will occur in the distant future, abstract messages are more motivating. The difference occurs because construal-level theory is more effective among strong E-WOM ties. Originality/value - By studying senders' perspectives, the authors make a new theoretical and practical contribution to the emerging literature on E-WOM communication. Specifically, the authors show how senders are persuaded to share information with their strong- or weak-tie audiences according to the concreteness of a message and temporal distance. The authors add construal-level theory and advertising message processing to the domain of E-WOM and social ties research.",2017"Cabanelas, Pablo; Cabanelas-Omil, Jose; Lampon, Jesus F.; Somorrostro, Patricia",The governance of regional research networks: lessons from Spain,REGIONAL STUDIES,"The governance of regional research networks: lessons from Spain.

Analysis of an original dataset, made up of 11 public research networks in Galicia (Spain), demonstrates that governance factors and performance are positively related. Strong ties - those with frequent and varied cooperative interactions - tend to prevail over weak ties, and networks with clearly defined structures and roles are also especially resilient. Companion-based trust has a significant and positive influence on performance. The implications suggest that when policy-makers decide to promote research networks, they should assess not only technical capabilities but also governance issues.",2017"Bastian, Bettina Lynda; Tucci, Christopher L.","Entrepreneurial advice sources and their antecedents Venture stage, innovativeness and internationalization",JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES-PEOPLE AND PLACES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY,"Purpose - Entrepreneurs interact with others and, through this, benefit from access to knowledge, resources and skills that enhance their own entrepreneurial and organizational capabilities. This paper aims to contribute to the literature interested in identifying and analyzing important antecedents of entrepreneurs' choices regarding social relations. The study shows how the venture stage, innovativeness and internationalization of the firm potentially influence entrepreneurial choices regarding their social sources of advice. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is based on cross-sectional survey data for the years 2009 and 2010, involving 13 Middle East and North African (MENA) countries. Respondents include future prospective entrepreneurs, start-ups and owner-managers of operating businesses, a total of 13,251 respondents across all countries for the entire period. Findings - Entrepreneurs with innovative ventures draw more on advice sources that are able to give information useful for the commercialization of innovative products, and entrepreneurs of internationally exposed ventures rely on a broad base of advice sources that can connect them with a foreign market. However, the outcomes regarding the impact of ""different venture stages"" point to social interaction patterns that are strongly influenced by local culture and that do not support the assumption of universal entrepreneurship behavior. This study shows that social interactions decline in quantity the more as the venture progresses in age. However, the type of social interaction (e.g. private or professional sources) that entrepreneurs engage throughout the different venture stages remains essentially the same and does not change across different entrepreneurial phases. In the MENA sample, private relations remain the most important source of advice throughout all phases, and they are not replaced by other contacts. Research limitations/implications - Limitations of this paper refer to the use of a large-scale database that cannot address certain issues without more direct observation, such as the quality of different social relations. Future research could address this issue by offering more fine-grained items for the different advice sources. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the debate on whether entrepreneurship is universal in nature. It focuses on data from emerging and developing countries in the Arab world, which is has not been studied very much in the entrepreneurship literature.",2017"Chen, Youyu; Shu, Tong; Chen, Shou; Wang, Shouyang; Lai, Kin Keung; Gan, Lu",Strong-weak collaborative management in coping supply chain disruption risk transmission based on scale-free networks,APPLIED ECONOMICS,"Supply chain disruption causes tremendous loss to supply chains and global businesses. Organizational structure and operational features of supply chain networks, therefore, constitute a major portion of research for coping with supply chain disruption risk.

Also, research methods are explicated; the scale-free networks and the theory of strong ties are integrated; the features of supply chain networks are considered from single statistical parameters and comprehensive analyses. Next, we provide numeric simulation of the properties of supply chain networks, verifying the accuracy of parameter analyses of single statistics and comprehensive analyses. Ultimately, when coping with supply chain disruption risk, each node enterprise of supply chain network is supposed to deploy the characteristics of scale-free networks to systematically manage existing weak ties, weak ties newly introduced, existing strong ties and strong ties newly introduced.

The authors represented the system of relations in a graph. The authors used the networks depicted to measure a set of relational properties and build a structural equation model (partial least squared-path modeling). Findings - The results highlight two important elements. First, the authors reveal the impact of the strength of weak and strong ties on contract awarding.

Design/methodology/approach - In a sample of 376 full-time business students the authors measured perceived employability, networking behaviour, access to information and resources and job-search learning goal orientation (JSLGO). Findings - The authors found networking is related to increased internal and external perceived employability by boosting access to information and resources. The results also demonstrate that networking is positively related to access to information and resources for low and high JSLGO, the relationship being stronger for those with higher levels. Research limitations/implications - The results provide an enriched view of individual networking behaviour by offering an indirect model of networking outcomes and to the graduate employability and social capital literatures.

Design/methodology/approach - First, a focus group study was conducted to identify major constructs and map out the proposed framework. This is then followed by questionnaire survey from 210 Malaysian multimedia super corridor (MSC) status corporations as recipients. Their international business affiliates refer to any organizations located outside Malaysia with which the recipient firm has a relationship. Data were analysed using SPSS. Findings - The findings suggest that the perceived value of the knowledge, relational dimension and cognitive dimension, as well as recipient learning intent and the attractiveness of a foreign source are significant related to the effectiveness of organizational cross-border knowledge transfer. Research limitations/implications - Because this research only covered 210 MSC status corporations, future research can try to have more coverage on other industry to have larger sample size for generalizability purposes. Other factors such as organizational and context characteristics can be added as antecedents to strengthen the framework for effective knowledge transfer. Practical implications-The empirical findings can be used as a guideline for MSC status firms to undergo a self-check and help them rethink and reposition themselves in light of the findings. It helps MSC status corporations to frame their organizational cross-border knowledge transfer activities to enable the creation and application of knowledge which should allow them to drive the capability of creating and retaining a greater value onto their core business competencies.

Although the Japanese CC movement has stagnated since mid-2005, a new experiment, Fukkou Ouen Chiiki Tsuka (CC for supporting disaster recovery), was introduced across disaster-damaged areas after the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami of March 2011. Previous studies assessing the role of CC in these earthquake-damaged areas are rare; the purpose of this paper is to examine the micro processes of community rebuilding that underlie the transactional networks mediated by one of the experiments, Domo, in Kamaishi. Design/methodology/approach - Using transactional records capturing residents' CC activities during the five-month pilot period before actual implementation of Domo simultaneous investigation for empirical network analysis techniques identify the network configuration dynamics representing the multiple observed forms of social capital in this disaster-affected local community. Findings - This study of the five-month pilot for the Domo system revealed: intensive dependence on the coordinating role of core members (i.e. the creation of weak ties), a lack of balanced support amongmembers and the resulting uni-directional transactions (i.e. the avoidance of generalized exchanges), and the reinforcement of previous transactional ties via reciprocation or transitive triads (i.e. the formation of strong ties).

Second, using a regression analysis with cross-sectional data, it shows that social capital accumulation along the life cycle is different for men and women, with men accumulating more social capital at all ages, with a different peak and overall profile. The study also shows that, over fifteen years, the gap in social capital by sex narrowed.

Intuitively weak ties might be less useful because people communicate less often with them, or more useful because they provide novel information. Granovetter's early work showed that more job-seekers get help via acquaintances than friends (Granovetter, 1973). However, recent work on job-finding (Gee et al., 2017) shows an apparent paradox of weak ties in the United States: most people are helped through one of their numerous weak ties, but a single stronger tie is significantly more valuable at the margin. Although some studies have addressed the importance of weak ties in job finding within specific countries, this is the first paper to use a single dataset and methodology to compare the importance of weak ties across countries. Here, we use de-identified data from almost 17 million social ties in 55 countries to document the widespread existence of this paradox of weak ties across many societies. More people get jobs where their weak ties work. However, this is not because weak ties are more helpful than strong ties - it is because they are more numerous. In every country, the likelihood of going to work where an individual friend works is increasing not decreasing - with tie strength. Yet, there is substantial variation in the added value of a strong tie at the margin across these countries. We show that the level of income inequality in a country is positively correlated with the added value of a strong tie, so that individual strong ties matter more when there is greater income inequality.

REFERRALS AND CAREER MOBILITY OF DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS IN ORGANIZATIONS,ILR REVIEW,"While prior research has suggested that network-based hiring in the form of referrals can lead to better career outcomes, few studies have tested whether such career advantages differ across demographic groups. Using archival data from a single organization for nearly 16,000 employees over an 11-year period, the authors examine the effect of hiring by referrals on the number of promotions employees receive and the differences in this effect across demographic groups. Drawing on theories of referral-based hiring, inequality, and career mobility, they argue that referral-based hiring provides unique promotion advantages for minorities compared to those hired without a referral. Consistent with this argument, they find that referrals are positively associated with promotions for one minority group, blacks, even after controlling for individual and regional labor market differences. The authors explore the possible mechanism for this finding, with initial evidence pointing to referrals providing a signal of quality for black employees. These results suggest refinement to prior research that attests that referral-based hiring disadvantages racial minorities.",2017"Siciliano, Michael D.",Professional Networks and Street-Level Performance: How Public School Teachers' Advice Networks Influence Student Performance,AMERICAN REVIEW OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,"Given the complexity of their work, street-level bureaucrats rely on their professional networks to access implementation resources and information.

Using value-added models derived from the student test data, objective measures of teacher performance were calculated.

Granovetter's ""strength of weak ties"", F. Fukuyama's ""spontaneous sociability"", and R.D. Putnam's, thin trust"". The entrepreneurs that coordinate their relations in innovation networks are faced with a continuous tension of making the independent competitive business decisions and building trust-based relations in their social and economic networks. These tensions call for an adequate integration of individual and collective perspectives in social behaviour of business organizations. The aim of this paper - to reveal the entrepreneurial approaches to decision making and trust building/maintaining in the networked business environments. This paper integrates insights from two separate yet complementary parts of research. In the first part, we discuss the main patterns of entrepreneurial decision making, based on S. Sarasvathy's theory of effectuation, and present the findings of empirical research on entrepreneurial decision making in complex business environments (survey of expert entrepreneurs in USA and Lithuania). The survey has shown that even though respondents operate in environments of similar uncertainty, their entrepreneurial predispositions are quite different. Despite these differences, they regard partnerships and networks as the single most important instrument for managing the environmental risk and uncertainty. In the second part, we present the theoretical insights and 3-stage model of trust emergence in entrepreneurial networks and findings of empirical research that covered 109 network facilitators from 37 countries from Europe and Americas. The development of trust in network of organizations contains at least three different stages that are characterised by different level / type of trust, and respective risks calling for the managerial intervention for promoting trust on the network level. The survey has revealed the personal factors as being of key importance throughout the process of inter-organizational trust development, while social and institutional factors becoming important in the later stages of the process. There is also an international diversity with regard to the choice of mechanisms for trust development (reliance on institutions vs. reliance on dominant organizations vs. self-organization).",2017"Wang, Xin; Hoi, Steven C.

The intuition of social recommendation is that users tend to show affinities with items favored by their social ties due to social influence. Despite the extensive studies, no existing work has attempted to distinguish and learn the personalized preferences between strong and weak ties, two important terms widely used in social sciences, for each individual in social recommendation. In this paper, we first highlight the importance of different types of ties in social relations originated from social sciences, and then propose a novel social recommendation method based on a new Probabilistic Matrix Factorization model that incorporates the distinction of strong and weak ties for improving recommendation performance. The proposed method is capable of simultaneously classifying different types of social ties in a social network w.r.t. optimal recommendation accuracy, and learning a personalized tie type preference for each user in addition to other parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets by comparing our method with state-of-the-art approaches, and find encouraging results that validate the efficacy of the proposed method in exploiting the personalized preferences of strong and weak ties for social recommendation.",2017"Dalgas, Karina Marcher",FILIPINO AU PAIRS ON THE MOVE: Navigating strong and weak ties in the search of future paths,NORDIC JOURNAL OF MIGRATION RESEARCH,"Most Filipina(2) au pairs in Denmark send remittances back home, and for many, au pairing forms part of longer-term migration trajectories.

Users of Linkedln or other professional SNS consistently reported higher informational benefits than non-users. The number of ties on the SNS used for professional purposes predicted informational benefits half a year later, and strong ties became more important over time. We also found evidence for a reciprocal relationship between strategic networking and informational benefits.

A number of recent research efforts have studied relationships between geolocation and social connectivity, social connectivity and preferences, and node attributes and strength of social ties. These efforts have successfully demonstrated prediction of various attributes based on social connectivity, mobility, dynamic checkin information, etc., including prediction of user location as well as future checkin locations. In this paper, we study the relationship between shared checkin locations and the structure and nature of social ties. We argue that typical LSBNs are in fact composed of layers of networks of varying structure and function and that it is possible to deconcolve these networks through effective statistical analysis of shared checkins. In this context, we pose and validate the following hypotheses: (1) A large number of shared checkins imply social connectivity; however, social connectivity does not imply statistically large number of shared checkins; (2) entities in social ties that share a large number of checkins tend to be strongly clustered. We hypothesize that such strong ties (e.g., family ties and friendships) carry higher influence compared to weaker ties (mere acquaintances) in the social network; (3) social ties that have statistically fewer shared checkins (weak ties) tend to be less clustered than the underlying (baseline) network. We hypothesize that such ties (e.g., professional ties, friends of friends, and acquaintances) carry less influence; and (4) social ties that have statistically large number of shared checkins (strong ties) tend to be relatively more dynamic when compared to weak ties over a period of time. We present statistical models and validate our hypotheses on real datasets.

Drawing on a unique dataset that includes a corpus of 10.24 million e-mail messages exchanged over five years among 601 employees in a high-technology firm, we find that network constraint impedes, whereas cultural fit promotes, individual attainment.

This paper applies social network analysis techniques to provide a concise evidence-based demonstration of the food industry's capacity to influence nutrition policymaking networks in Australia. Network analysis using four rounds of data collection was undertaken, and the capacity of individual actors and occupational categories to influence policy decision makers were analysed. Network graphs were developed using cluster analysis to identify the structure of clusters and the path distance of actors from decision makers. The assumed advantage for the 'food industry' was present both strategically in overall network position and with respect to the number of direct access points to 'decision makers', whereas 'nutrition professionals' were densely clustered together with limited links to key 'decision makers'. The results demonstrate that the food industry holds the strategic high ground in advocating their interests to policymakers in the contexts studied.

Consequently, as firms launch new product development (NPD), it has become more critical to determine a method by which to integrate technology and knowledge together and to enhance absorptive capability (AC) of firms in the process of information, technology and knowledge sharing. This study thus combines the concepts of corporate social capital (CSC), intellectual capital, and AC, and discusses the influence of internal/external resource integration on technology integration mechanisms (TIM) and knowledge integration mechanisms (KIM), as well as AC's effect on NPD. Three hundred and ninety-four valid responses were collected and partial least squares structural equation modeling was adopted for data analysis. The results show that interaction ties and the shared language of CSC positively affect TIM, while human capital and organizational capital have positive influences on KIM. In addition, TIM and KIM both have significant and positive influences on AC and AC further influences NPD performance. Therefore, this study suggests that firms have to establish interaction bases for utilizing external knowledge to assist in NPD, and this can be achieved by offering a friendly environment to encourage employees to be more willing to contribute their knowledge.",2016"Hatala, John-Paul; Yamkovenko, Bogdan",Weak Ties and Self-regulation in Job Search: The Effects of Goal Orientation on Networking,JOURNAL OF CAREER DEVELOPMENT,"The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between the self-regulatory variable of goal orientation and the extent to which job seekers reach out to and use weak ties in their job search. Weak ties, as defined by Granovettor, are connections to densely knit networks outside the individual's direct contacts who could provide nonredundant information. The study builds on the previous conceptual work that discussed how learning and performance goal orientation, as a part of a larger system of self-regulatory variables, may affect the extent to which individuals seek feedback and network during job search. Using a sample of Canadian job seekers, this study examines whether learning goal-oriented individuals contact weak ties more often than performance goal-oriented individuals.

Our context of study is a community of educators using and sharing teaching resources such as lesson plans, presentation slides and animations. We consider whether the deduced relationships between members of the community of educators constitute weak ties. A deduced relationship exists when two educators access the same resource. If these deduced relationships do constitute weak ties, then other theorized network properties should also be manifest, namely homophily and triadic closures. Our findings support these theoretical conjectures. Firstly, results indicate that the strength of a tie is directly proportional to the level of similarity between users in the network in terms of their propensity to use and share resources and their level of comfort with and use of technology (homophily property). Secondly, we found strong support for the triadic closure property (formation of a weak tie between unconnected nodes that share a common neighbor). Thus, we developed a computational model to predict the formation of weak ties via triadic closures with an accuracy of 97.8 %. Finally, we show that augmenting collaborative and hybrid recommender systems with our triadic closure prediction model can improve the performance of these systems.",2016"Ryan, Louise",Looking for weak ties: using a mixed methods approach to capture elusive connections,SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,"Since Granovetter's path breaking work in the 1970s, there has been much discussion about the relevance of weak ties in finding new jobs and generally getting ahead in society. Subsequent research has found evidence to both support and challenge his original theory. However, concerns have also been expressed about the meaning of this concept. What exactly are 'weak ties', how are they created and what resources flow through them? In my previous work, I have distinguished between horizontal and vertical ties and the relationships and resources available within them. This paper goes further; drawing on new, mixed methods research with Polish migrants, I explore what types of social ties are useful in contexts of deskilling and finding jobs commensurate with qualifications. Interrogating the concept of 'weak ties', I argue that tie strength and ethnic composition are less important than relative social distance and willingness to share valuable resources. I propose that 'strong ties' can also act as vertical bridges (or ladders), while ties which are too 'weak' may lack necessary trust to share latent resources.

This study seeks to identify the factors that shape the communication networks of men who face a potential diagnosis of prostate cancer, and how these factors relate to their disclosure about their changing health status. Background. Men facing a potential diagnosis of prostate cancer are in a challenging situation; the support benefits of disclosing their changing health status to others in their communication networks is set against a backdrop of the potential stigma and uncertainty of the diagnosis. Design. All men on a prostate biopsy waiting list were eligible for inclusion in an exploratory and interpretive study. Methods. Semi-structured interviews with 40 men explored their network structures and disclosure of health information. Thematic analysis highlighted the factors which contributed to their network structures and their disclosure about their health status. Results. Four network factors shaped men's perspectives about disclosing their health status: (1) tie strength, comprising both strong and weak ties; (2) knowledgeable others, with a focus on medical professionals in the family; (3) homophily, which included other individuals with a similar medical condition; and (4) geographical proximity, with a preference for face-to-face communication. Conclusion. Communication networks influence men's disclosure of their health status and in particular weak ties with medical knowledge have an important role. Men who use the potential for support in their networks may experience improved psychosocial outcomes. Relevance to clinical practice. Using these four network factors-tie strength, knowledgeable others, homophily or geographical proximity-to forecast men's willingness to disclose helps identify men who lack potential support and so are at risk of poor psychosocial health. Those with few strong ties or knowledgeable others in their networks may be in the at-risk cohort. The support provided in communication networks complements formal medical care from nurses and other health professionals, and encouraging patients to use their communication networks improves the psychosocial health of the men themselves, their partners and their families.",2016"Newbery, Robert; Gorton, Matthew; Phillipson, Jeremy; Atterton, Jane",Sustaining business networks: Understanding the benefit bundles sought by members of local business associations,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-GOVERNMENT AND POLICY,"Local business associations can be important mechanisms for stimulating inter-firm cooperation leading to economic growth and development. However, previous research suggests that the unfulfilled expectations of their members can lead to low participation, high membership churn and network instability over time. As a departure from studies that have explored why local associations supply certain benefits and services, this paper draws on an original, demand side membership survey of local business associations to identify for the first time the bundles of benefits sought by members. Two bundles of benefits (instrumental and info-social) relating to thin and thick models of rational choice, respectively, are identified in explaining why firms join and remain part of associations. The relevance of these bundles to members was found to vary with business profile and length of membership, with the value of instrumental benefits reducing over time, whereas the demand for info-social benefits remained relatively stable.

However, treating all associations alike may produce biased conclusions. This study therefore proposes that institutional affiliation, defined as a socially contextualized pattern of group belonging, is a form of organizational social capital. Specifically, I suggest that there are three types of institutional affiliations. First, the primary affiliation is composed of groups in which members share strong ties and bond together with personal, empathic, and enduring relationships. Second, the secondary affiliation comprises certain associations that seek to achieve their proclaimed goals within or beyond their collectivities, in the latter case possibly reaching to the level of a wider community or a whole society. Lastly, the dual affiliation exists as an intersection between the two prior affiliations. Using a nationally representative data set from Korea, the study found that both primary and secondary affiliations are related to occupational status, whereas only the secondary affiliation is associated with civic actions. However, dual affiliation is redundant and unable to form a positive association with either outcome. In conclusion, this study suggests that institutional affiliation is an alternative measure of organizational social capital, taking the contextual characteristics of associations in a case country into account.",2016"Vohra, Neharika; Thomas, Nobin",Investigating Organizational Learning through Social Network Analysis: The Case of a Consultancy Firm in India,THUNDERBIRD INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW,"Three problems beset the literature on organizational learning-confusion about who learns (individuals, groups, or organization), absence of a robust theory, and tools for measurement.

Some aspects of information diffusion are best explained by network structural characteristics while in some cases strong influence comes from individual decisions. We introduce reinvention, the ability to modify information, as an individual level decision that affects the diffusion process as a whole. Based on a combination of constructs from the Diffusion of Innovations and the Critical Mass Theories, the present study advances the CMS (consume, modify, share) model which accounts for the interplay between network structure and human behavior and interactions. The model's building blocks include processes leading up to and following the formation of a critical mass of information adopters and disseminators. We examine the formation of an inflection point, information reach, sustainability of the diffusion process and collective value creation. The CMS model is tested on two directed networks and one undirected network, assuming weak or strong ties and applying constant and relative modification schemes. While all three networks are designed for disseminating new knowledge they differ in structural properties. Our findings suggest that modification enhances the diffusion of information in networks that support undirected connections and carries the biggest effect when information is shared via weak ties. Rogers' diffusion model and traditional information contagion models are fine tuned. Our results show that modifications not only contribute to a sustainable diffusion process, but also aid information in reaching remote areas of the network. The results point to the importance of cultivating weak ties, allowing reciprocal interaction among nodes and supporting the modification of information in promoting diffusion processes. These results have theoretical and practical implications for designing networks aimed at accelerating the creation and diffusion of information.",2016"Bendtsen, Kristian Moss; Uekermann, Florian; Haerter, Jan O.",Expert Game experiment predicts emergence of trust in professional communication networks,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,"Strong social capital is increasingly recognized as an organizational advantage.

Amongst them, two are known to play a central role in shaping the networks evolution, namely the heterogeneous propensity of individuals to i) be socially active and ii) establish a new social relationships with their alters. Here, we empirically characterise these two mechanisms in seven real networks describing temporal human interactions in three different settings: scientific collaborations, Twitter mentions, and mobile phone calls. We find that the individuals' social activity and their strategy in choosing ties where to allocate their social interactions can be quantitatively described and encoded in a simple stochastic network modelling framework. The Master Equation of the model can be solved in the asymptotic limit. The analytical solutions provide an explicit description of both the system dynamic and the dynamical scaling laws characterising crucial aspects about the evolution of the networks. The analytical predictions match with accuracy the empirical observations, thus validating the theoretical approach.

To incorporate a balance argument in a conventional setting, we develop an adjusted exposure level to study an individual's delinquency choice. We show this choice is affected by not only how many delinquent peers an individual directly and indirectly connects with, but also who those peers are. Specifically, exposure to delinquent peers is not universally risky, and could even be protective if the average exposure level of the individual's delinquent peers is significantly less than her own exposure level. In addition, we show that individuals with high exposure levels are more sensitive to structural changes in the delinquent network. Therefore, a policy aiming to isolate key players in the network could be more cost-effective than strengthening the law-enforcement system.",2016"Wu, Qiyan; Zhang, Xiaoling; Xu, Yilun; Li, Tian","Dualities of semi-urbanization villages in social-spatial transition: A case study of Zhoucun village in suburban Nanjing, China",JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES,"In contrast with the classical topics of poverty and exclusion of rural areas, the multiple dualities in the social-spatial dimension of villages in semi-urbanized suburbs of China's large cities have received little attention to date. As this paper demonstrates, such dualities have emerged during China's rapid urbanization since the early 2000s. It is firstly argued that these dual characteristics are derived from the institutional separation of urban and rural entitlements (e.g., hukou, welfare, land property ownership etc.). These distinctions are then projected into social capital differentiation, such as the division between the strong and weak ties of local community residents. Consequentially, the dualities are embodied in the residential space segregation between established residents and rural migrants that is divided into Houses in Single-Family Occupancy (HSFOs) and Houses in Multiple-Family Occupancy (HMFOs). To support these claims, a case study of the village of Zhoucun, a southern suburb of the Nanjing Metropolitan Area on the east coast China, is used. This draws on both quantitative and qualitative data that includes interviews with authorized officers from local government to municipal government, and a questionnaire survey and interviews with both the HSFO and HMFO residents themselves.

We focus on brokerage and closure as two dimensions of social structure where tension arises between individual networking strategies and team performance. Adopting a multilevel perspective, and focusing on closed teams with the presence of a clear leader, we analyze two complementary moderators of this social dilemma that are fundamental to the existence of teams: the task complexity facing the team under consideration, and the individualist versus collectivist shared value orientation of its members. We find that an increase in either of these makes the social dilemma more likely to occur.

Two types of prisoner's dilemma models are examined in this study: the traditional two strategy model considering only cooperators and defectors; the expanded three-strategy model consisting cooperators, defectors and extortioners. The results show that tie strength model contributes to the promotion of cooperation in both types of prisoner's dilemma games. However, we point out that the influence of the investment preference is quite different in the two prisoner's dilemma game settings. In the two-strategy prisoner's dilemma game, only small preference contributes to the promotion of cooperation. Once this preference exceeds a critical value, cooperation will be prohibited. We explain this phenomenon by arguing that extremely strong investment preference undermines the ability of cooperative clusters to resist defectors. Moreover, we extend the analysis into the three-strategy case and discover that the catalytic effect of extortioners can eliminate this first up and then down trend in the two-strategy model. The equilibrium fraction of cooperators is always positively correlated to the level of investment preference in three-strategy models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This analysis examines the association between long-term gang membership and adolescent informal social control processes, drug use, and delinquency. This research is based on data from a study of 160 Mexican American male gang members between the ages of 16 and 20. Findings suggest that among gang members in this context, commonly studied informal control mechanisms such as the family and schools do not function to deter long-term gang membership that is associated with serious criminal and violent behavior and drug use.

From Collaboration to Service Provision in an Agricultural Co-operative,SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS,"Recent years have seen a proliferation of state supports to increase agriculture and rural economic development through co-operative ventures. Implicit or explicit in these activities is the mobilisation of social capital to achieve economic aims. To date, few studies have addressed the long term evolution of social capital-based relationships. In this article, we assess the evolving role of social capital in an agricultural co-operative, using the development of machinery rings in Scotland as a case-study. Drawing on Bourdieu's conceptualisation of capital exchange, we explore the establishment, formalisation, and commoditisation of different capitals embedded in the rings. Findings demonstrate that a range of capital types was important at each stage of machinery ring development, enabling them to evolve in relation to the changes affecting the agriculture industry in Scotland. Early adoption of advanced information technologies enabled the mobilisation of network resources and successful service provision across increasing geographical scales. Through formalisation, the rings became sources of human, social, and economic capitals - access to which could be purchased by new ring members. This formalisation process ultimately led to the establishment of the rings as economically viable businesses, but also a shift in identity from farmer collaboration to commercial service provision.",2016"Giannella, Eric; Fischer, Claude S.",An inductive typology of egocentric networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,"We apply Random Forests to detailed survey data of social relations in order to derive an inductive typology of egocentric networks.

This paper focuses on the question of how the digital world might influence social relationships. There is an argument in previous researches between the three different possibilities: with extra volume brought by convenience of communication devices, will people tend to deepen their strong ties or broaden their weak ties or keep a ""no change mode."" Our idea to address this problem is to investigate the distributions of per-node weight rather than all weights in the mobile phone network. Using CDRs data of 32,000 active mobile phone users, the empirical finding shows that the distributions of the logarithmic weights follow the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The shape parameter of the GEV distribution reveals the existence of a typical strategy. The typical strategy could be regarded as an ""intrinsic strategy"" which indicates that the majority of people have strategies similar to the typical one, while the rest deviate far from it.

Sources and Effects of Social Capital in the Workplace,SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH,"Substantial evidence illustrates that the social capital of a society affects the productivity of its firms and thereby lifts economic growth rates. The precise transmission mechanisms from social attitudes to organizational efficiency are still a black box. This paper investigates whether and in what form the social and institutional trust of employees has an impact on networks and trust within a firm (termed workplace social capital). A two-level approach enables a simultaneous analysis of potential individual-level and firm-level driving forces of workplace social capital surveyed from 1244 employees of 116 firms. Individual endowments of social and institutional trust are strongly associated with increased rates of workplace social capital at the employee level. High-trust individuals also appear to be clustered in firms, which is evidence for a sorting effect and the potential impact of a firm's embeddedness in the local area. Aggregated firm rates of workplace social capital are influenced by some of the management tools analysed such as focus on worker's health and work-life balance. In addition, we find that workplace social capital has a sizable and beneficial impact on satisfaction with obtained wage indicated by employees which is assumed to be a fundamental precondition for high work effort. Thus, we observe a link going from individual trust to wage satisfaction that is mediated by workplace social capital and represents a potential causal mechanism for inducing higher workforce productivity.",2016"Tkacz, Daria; McGhee, Derek",Polish Migrant Parents of Secondary School Boys in the United Kingdom,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES,"This article focuses on the parents of secondary school Polish boys and their capacity to realise their educational and professional aspirations for their children.

Shanghai's gated compound entails an introverted, self-contained lifestyle with little contact with the local people.

However, it can be a real challenge to organize architectural innovation, all the more so when success hinges upon close collaboration with other firms that are responsible for different subsystems of the end product. This study examines the impact of product design rules and the degree of organizational coupling among innovation network partners on the performance of architectural innovation, projects. Using data from 2-70 collaborative innovation networks in the United States, we found an inversely U-shaped relationship between the presence of design rules and architectural innovation performance. When a certain turning point is reached, dominant design rules have a pronounced net negative impact on the performance of collaborative architectural innovation projects. At the same time, our findings reveal that lead firms can alleviate this negative effect of strong design rules by selecting loosely coupled innovation partners. Accordingly, our findings suggest that the presence of design rules and the extent of partner coupling should be considered jointly when optimizing network configurations that focus on architectural innovation.

The aim of this paper is to examine personal network types in relation to long-term condition management in order to identify the properties of network types most likely to provide support for those with a long-term condition. Method A cross-sectional observational survey of people with type 2 diabetes using interviews and questionnaires was conducted between April and October 2013 in six European countries: Greece, Spain, Bulgaria, Norway, United Kingdom, and Netherlands. 1862 people with predominantly lower socio-economic status were recruited from each country. We used k-means clustering analysis to derive the network types, and one-way analysis of variance and multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore the relationship between network type socio-economic characteristics, self-management monitoring and skills, well-being, and network member work. Results Five network types of people with long-term conditions were identified: restricted, minimal family, family, weak ties, and diverse. Restricted network types represented those with the poorest self-management skills and were associated with limited support from social network members. Restricted networks were associated with poor indicators across self-management capacity, network support, and well-being. Diverse networks were associated with more enhanced self-management skills amongst those with a long-term condition and high level of emotional support. It was the three network types which had a large number of network members (diverse, weak ties, and family) where healthcare utilisation was most likely to correspond to existing health needs. Discussion Our findings suggest that type of increased social involvement is linked to greater self-management capacity and potentially lower formal health care costs indicating that diverse networks constitute the optimal network type as a policy in terms of the design of LTCM interventions and building support for people with LTCs.",2016"Ma, Jing; Zhang, Wei; Harris, Keith; Chen, Qiang; Xu, Xiaolin",Dying online: live broadcasts of Chinese emerging adult suicides and crisis response behaviors,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,"Background: Social media and online environments are becoming increasingly popular and integral to modern lives. The online presentation of suicidal behaviors is an example of the importance of communication technologies, and the need for professionals to respond to a changing world. These types of behaviors, however, have rarely been scientifically analyzed. This study aimed to examine the behaviors of both suicide broadcasters and their audience, with attention on prevention/crisis opportunities. Methods: Multiple case studies were employed to explore live-broadcast suicide by Chinese emerging adults (aged 18-25 years). Six cases were selected (four males, two females; aged 19-24, M = 21.60, SD = 2.25), retrieved from 190 public documents (case range = 5 to 32; M = 11.50, SD = 10.37). A qualitative study based on grounded theory was adopted. Information on case background, stages, participants and their behaviors were collected. Results: (1) Five stages of blogcast suicide incidents were revealed, including: Signaling, Initial reactions, Live blogcast of suicide attempts, Crisis responses, and Final outcomes. (2) Common behavioral trends (e.g., comforting, verbal abuse) were identified from the blogcast participants (e.g., active audience, peers, parents and police). (3) Suicide blogcasters exhibited tendencies to communicated signs of pain and cries for help. Conclusions: This multi-case study found live presentations of suicidal behaviors offered unique opportunities to respond to suicidal crises, and also to learn more about the relationships between suicidal people and potential help sources. Findings showed many audience members wanted to be helpful but lacked appropriate skills or knowledge. Others engaged in suicide cyberbullying. The social media is an environment in the making. This study revealed that increasing knowledge and skills for crisis response and suicide prevention is needed.

Relevant knowledge and resources can often be found outside an entrepreneur's immediate competencies and expertise. For this reason, entrepreneurs use social relations to get access to these resources. This paper analyzes the role of such social relations when it comes to entrepreneurial performance; it also explores how entrepreneurial choices regarding social networks depend on the quality of the institutions for whom they work. Low-quality institutions create environmental uncertainties that have significant effects on an entrepreneur's strategic choices and the usage and usefulness of their social networks.

We compute the average traffic distance to derive the optimal per-node capacity, which is then analyzed from the social perspective. Based on the communication pattern, we introduce the quasi-strong ties and quasi-weak ties in order to discover how system parameters control the amount of network flows with different strengths of social relationships.

Drawing on organizational learning theory and analyzing survey data obtained from 392 department heads and project leaders of new product development teams, we demonstrate that cross-functional coopetition has a significant positive effect on exploratory innovation. Moreover, we find support for the moderating influence of social cohesion on the relationship between coopetition and exploitative innovation.

Despite this, the role of supply chain actors has been largely overlooked in strategies seeking to encourage the installation of more sustainable domestic heating technologies. With reference to central heating, this paper responds through an ethnographic analysis of how plumbers' merchants and sales representatives can influence the work of heating installers in the United Kingdom. It applies two dimensions of the concept of 'social capital': relational and structural. Relational social capital focuses on the trust, loyalty and reciprocity at play in relations, whilst structural social capital considers how the strength of tie can influence those to whom people turn for advice and support. Together, these ideas demonstrate how relationships amongst these groups can serve to influence product choice and facilitate information exchange. The paper concludes by discussing how these supply chains might be engaged with as a means of encouraging the installation of low carbon domestic technologies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We theorize that the relational dimension of social capital (e.g., tie strength) can act as a substitute for the structural benefits of network closure, and so a network-bridging tie yields more value when it is also strong. We further investigate if it is emotional closeness, interaction frequency, or trust that underlies this relational enhancement effect. The results from analyzing a bounded network in a large consulting firm and egocentric networks in the engineering division of a large manufacturer provide support for the relational-enhancement effect of tie strength and further identify trust as the key mechanism allowing network actors to unlock the value embedded in their network-bridging ties.",2016"Bhardwaj, Arjun; Qureshi, Israr; Konrad, Alison M.; Lee, Seung Hwan (Mark)","A Two-Wave Study of Self-Monitoring Personality, Social Network Churn, and In-Degree Centrality in Close Friendship and General Socializing Networks",GROUP & ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT,"We examine the role of self-monitoring personality in shaping network change in two important types of social relationships.

Simultaneous examination of the formation and dissolution of relationships over time (network churn) reveals that this pattern of network change is shaped by differential reactions of relationship partners to individuals based upon level of self-monitoring in the two network types.

SNEE represents a new learning methodology, which is based on the concept of social networks and represents an extended model of project-led education. The concept of social networks was applied in the real-life experiment, considering two different dimensions: (1) to organize the education process as a social network-based process; and (2) to analyze the students' interactions in the context of evaluation of the students learning performance. The objective of this paper is to present a new model for students evaluation based on their behavior during the course and its validation in comparison with the traditional model of students' evaluation. The validation of the new evaluation model is made through an analysis of the correlation between social network analysis measures (degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and average tie strength) and the grades obtained by students (grades for quality of work, grades for volume of work, grades for diversity of work, and final grades) in a social network-based engineering education. The main finding is that the obtained correlation results can be used to make the process of the students' performance evaluation based on students interactions (behavior) analysis, to make the evaluation partially automatic, increasing the objectivity and productivity of teachers and allowing a more scalable process of evaluation. The results also contribute to the behavioural theory of learning performance evaluation. More specific findings related to the correlation analysis are: (1) the more different interactions a student had (degree centrality) and the more frequently the student was between the interaction paths of other students (betweenness centrality), the better was the quality of the work; (2) all five social network measures had a positive and strong correlation with the grade for volume of work and with the final grades; and (3) a student with high average tie strength had a higher grade for diversity of work than those with low ties.",2016"Sutcliffe, A.

Our model focuses on the evolutionary trade-offs between foraging and social interaction, and explores the impact of alternative strategies for distributing social interaction, with fitness criteria for wellbeing, alliance formation, risk, stress and access to food resources that reward social strategies differentially. The results suggest that multi-level social structures characterised by a few strong relationships, more medium ties and large numbers of weak ties emerge only in a small part of the overall fitness landscape, namely where there are significant fitness benefits from wellbeing and alliance formation and there are high levels of social interaction. In contrast, 'favour-the-few' strategies are more competitive under a wide range of fitness conditions, including those producing homogeneous, single-level societies of the kind found in many birds and mammals. The simulations suggest that the development of complex, multi-level social structures of the kind found in many primates (including humans) depends on a capacity for high investment in social time, preferential social interaction strategies, high mortality risk and/or differential reproduction.

We propose that anomie encompasses two dimensions: a perceived breakdown in social fabric (i.e., disintegration as lack of trust and erosion of moral standards) and a perceived breakdown in leadership (i.e., deregulation as lack of legitimacy and effectiveness of leadership). Across six studies we present evidence for the validity of the new measure, the Perception of Anomie Scale (PAS). Studies 1a and 1b provide evidence for the proposed factor structure and internal consistency of PAS. Studies 2a-c provide evidence of convergent and discriminant validity.

In general, weak ties occur in networks where relatively few individuals are responsible for maintaining linkages between groups of individuals that would otherwise be poorly connected. This common structural motif can be seen in the social networks of species with fission-fusion social organization, such as giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis). Giraffe social networks are characterized by social cliques in which individuals associate more with members of their own social clique than with those outside their clique. Individuals involved in weak, between-clique social interactions are hypothesized to serve as bridges by which an infection may enter a clique and, hence, may experience higher infection risk. Here, we address this and other hypotheses explaining helminth infection patterns in wild giraffe, exploring the relative roles of the social network and ranging behavior in determining infection risk. We show that infection risk is more influenced by weak ties with individuals outside one's clique than by repeated contact with a core set of associates. Even when controlling for age and home range size, individuals who engaged in more between-clique associations, that is, those with multiple weak ties, were more likely to be infected with gastrointestinal helminth parasites. Our results suggest that diverse social interactions with giraffe from multiple cliques may increase exposure to pathogens.

We examine how the use of one ICT intervention-specifically, eHealth kiosks disseminating authenticated and accessible medical information-can alleviate the problem of high infant mortality in rural India. We investigate how mothers' social networks affect their use of eHealth kiosks, seeking professional medical care for their infants and, ultimately, infant mortality. Drawing on the social epidemiology and social networks literatures, we focus on advice and hindrance from both strong and weak ties as the conduit of social influence on mothers' health-related behaviors for the care of their infants. Over a period of 7 years, we studied 4,620 infants across 10 villages where the eHealth kiosks were implemented along with support resources for proxy use. The results revealed that (1) eHealth kiosk use promotes seeking professional medical care and reduces infant mortality, (2) mothers are especially vulnerable to hindrance from both strong and weak ties as they choose to maintain the status quo of traditional infant healthcare practices (e.g., reliance on untrained personnel, superstitions, fatalism) in villages, and (3) advice from both strong and weak ties offers the potential to break down misplaced beliefs about infant healthcare practices and to develop literacy on seeking professional medical care. In contrast, in a comparative group of 10 neighboring villages, the reduction in infant mortality was not as pronounced and the effect of professional medical care in reducing infant mortality was lower. Our findings suggest that an ICT intervention can effectively address one of society's most important problems (i.e., infant mortality) even in parts of the world with limited resources and deep suspicion of technology and change.

The conceptual framework relies on social capital and communication theory, including tie strength, type of message, and advertising literacy. To test the research hypotheses, the study carries out two experiments involving 346 participants. The results show that interactive advertising gains greater consumer attitude toward the ad and higher message-sharing intention than non-interactive advertising does. The social tie is an important factor in moderating the effects of the message format and advertising literacy on communication effectiveness. This research advances the social capital and communication literature by explaining the effectiveness of consumers sharing advertising based on Internet-mediated communication. Research findings provide managerial implication for companies to better plan online marketing strategies in this social networking era. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Scholars generally believe that social ties impact labor market outcomes. Two explanatory mechanisms have been identified, emphasizing access to better job offers in pecuniary terms and the efficacy of non-redundant information. The evidence informing each theory, however, has been inconsistent and circumstantial. We test predictions from both models using a rich set of job search data collected from an MBA student population, including detailed information about search channels and characteristics of job offers. Importantly, we can compare offers made to the same student derived via different search channels while accounting for industry, function, and non-pecuniary characteristics. We find that contrary to conventional wisdom, search through social networks typically results in job offers with lower total compensation (-17 percent for referrals through strong ties and -16 percent for referrals via weak ties vs. formal search). However, our models also show that students are considerably more likely to accept offers derived via weak ties. They do so because they are perceived to have greater growth potential and other non-pecuniary value. On balance, our tests are consistent with Granovetter's argument that networks provide value by facilitating access to information that is otherwise difficult to obtain, rather than providing greater pecuniary compensation.",2016"Lobel, Ilan; Sadler, Evan","Preferences, Homophily, and Social Learning",OPERATIONS RESEARCH,"We study a sequential model of Bayesian social learning in networks in which agents have heterogeneous preferences, and neighbors tend to have similar preferences-a phenomenon known as homophily.

When connections are sparse, diverse preferences are harmful to learning, and homophily may lead to substantial improvements. In contrast, in a dense network, preference diversity is beneficial. Intuitively, diverse ties introduce more independence between observations while providing less information individually.

Building on this research, the present study identifies specific types of social network and gauges their value for predicting fertility behavior. METHODS Based on data from the German Family Panel (N = 3,104 respondents aged 20 to 42), four types of ego-centric social networks were identified using cluster analyses. Clusters were used to prospectively predict the transition to parenthood using a discrete-time event history analysis. RESULTS In the event history analyses, the highest propensity to start a family was found for 'family-centered' social networks, which were characterized primarily by a high share of persons with young children, a high amount of network support in case of parenthood, and a high proportion of strong ties to members of the nuclear family. By contrast, respondents who were embedded in 'family-remote' networks had the lowest transition rate to parenthood. Family-remote networks were characterized by a high share of friends and acquaintances, a high proportion of weak ties, and a low amount of social support and social pressure. Regarding selection effects, a comparison of cluster affiliation over time does not consistently confirm that persons who start a family select themselves into 'fertility-promoting' network types. In sum, the results enhance our understanding of how mechanisms of social influence and structural features of egocentric social networks are interlinked.",2016"Diez-Vial, Isabel; Montoro-Sanchez, Angeles",How knowledge links with universities may foster innovation: The case of a science park,TECHNOVATION,"The objective of this research is to evaluate how technological knowledge flows from universities may increase innovation by firms located in a science park.

We also argue that firms located in central positions inside the local firm-network have access to a complementary source of technical knowledge. Empirical evidence gathered from the Madrid Science Park confirms that having long-term relationships with universities, based on both formal and informal interactions, is the most important means of obtaining technical knowledge from them. We also observed a positive relationship between the technological knowledge obtained from universities and the innovation carried out by firms. Finally, we confirmed that firms with a significant role as intermediaries between other co-located firms have a higher level of innovation even if they are not involved in relationships with the university.

The long term evolution of this dynamic can be explained with a simplified qualitative model that considers the processes of dyadic sociability-exchange, trust and collective sociability.

We show that the effect of a referral-restricting policy on non-networked workers can be either positive or negative, depending on model parameters.

Drawing on Bourdieu's capital theory, it shows how weak bridging ties with natives facilitate migrants' access to better jobs within lower-skilled sectors, whereas strong ties with natives generate distinct cultural resources often required for high-skilled occupations. I consider two strategies of converting strong bridging ties into cultural capital, signalling some limitations of weak ties in facilitating career advancement: mobilizing British friends to act as cultural brokers', and immersion in British professional networks to acquire and demonstrate local cultural capital.

To this end, co-invention networks for R and D organizations are constructed from an inventor-patent database, and the three structural patterns are measured by using network analytic constructs, namely, structural holes, strength of ties, and centralization.

Employing restricted-use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, our empirical results indicate that Blacks have higher PEA-usage rates than Whites, likely caused by their higher unemployment rates. However, Whites in regions with relatively weak professional networks tended to tap into PEAs more than otherwise similar Blacks, reducing the Black-White differential in PEA usage. These findings fit with the conceptual prediction that Whites endure a disproportionate negative impact when tighter labor markets (and thus fewer referrals) exist. They also raise the question about whether current anti-labor-market discrimination policies account for potential job-referral differentials between Black and Whites.

Prior research has distinguished networks that are emergent from networks that are orchestrated. While empirical studies have shown situations in which the role and scope of intentional governance of whole interorganizational networks has changed in time, and there is a growing interest regarding the endogenous drivers of network dynamics, the dimensions that influence intentional governance of network structure dynamics and the way this is carried out remain still to be elucidated. In order to pinpoint these drivers, we leverage the models of network structure dynamics elaborated within studies conducted at the intersection between network research and complexity science to propose a multilevel interpretive framework that clarifies the role and scope of intentional agency at different structural levels of interorganizational networks. Our framework advances a twofold conceptual contribution: on one hand, we tackle the change in the role and scope of intentional governance of network structures in both the early stages and the later stages of network evolution. On the other, we interpret the network of formal ties as resembling the accelerating network model, with the network of informal ties being akin to the scale-free (or truncated scale-free) network model of complex networks theory.",2016"Qureshi, Israr; Kistruck, Geoffrey M.; Bhatt, Babita",The Enabling and Constraining Effects of Social Ties in the Process of Institutional Entrepreneurship,ORGANIZATION STUDIES,"While the past decade has produced a number of insights into the process of institutional change, scholars still lack a comprehensive understanding of the germinal stages of institutional entrepreneurship. More specifically, further knowledge is needed into what factors cause certain individuals to initiate norm-breaking behaviour while others continue to adhere to societal expectations. Prior work seeking to inform this question has focused either on individual-level or environmental-level explanations. Comparatively, we employ a social network perspective as a meso-level' lens into the space where actors and their environment intersect. Based upon our qualitative findings, we propose that social ties can serve as an important factor in enabling (heterophilic ties) as well as constraining (homophilic ties) institutional change.

We analyze data from the US, East Germany before 1989, and post-reform China, combining the first-difference method and Heckman selection procedure to deal with endogeneity. Empirical findings from different labor market contexts demonstrate that: (1) contact resources have a causal and positive role in job outcomes; (2) in a market economy, the role of resources is more salient if they provide within-occupation job-leads; (3) under state job-assignment systems occupational homophily does not pay off; and (4) job-search ties can take the form of heterophilous selection.

First, results from an agent-based model are consistent with the logic of our argument and are robust across a variety of initial conditions.

Measured by intergroup communication and mutual support, this study reveals that migrants are more likely to interact with their urban neighbours, which suggests that migrants might not only interact with each other but also are willing to interact and help with local neighbours. Furthermore, compared with modern commodity housing neighbourhoods developed through the real estate market, older and physically more deprived neighbourhoods characterised by courtyard housing and provisional shelters have higher levels of this intergroup bridging social interaction.

Methods Questionnaires based on The Health Professions Stress Inventory (HPSI) developed by Wolfgang experienced by healthcare providers were collected from 420 nurses, doctors and radiological technologists in two general hospitals in Korea by a multistage cluster sampling method. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the effects of friendship networks on job stress after controlling for other factors. Results The severity of job stress differed according to level of job demands (p = .006); radiologic technologists experienced the least stress (45.4), nurses experienced moderate stress (52.4), and doctors experienced the most stress (53.6). Those with long-term friendships characterized by strong connections reported lower levels of stress than did those with weak ties to friends among nurses (1.3, p <. 05) and radiological technologists (11.4, p <. 01). The degree of cohesion among friends had a positive impact on the level of job stress experienced by nurses (8.2, p <. 001) and radiological technologists (14.6, p <. 1). Doctors who participated in workplace alumni meetings scored higher than those who did not. However, those who participated in alumni meetings outside the workplace showed the opposite tendency, scoring 9.4 (p <. 05) lower than those who did not. The resources from their friendship network include both information and instrumental support. As most radiological technologists were male, their instrumental support positively affected their job stress (9.2, p <. 05). Life information support was the primary positive contributor to control of nurses' (4.1, p <. 05), radiological technologists' (8.0, p <. 05) job stress.

Migration has long been an important aspect of West African social, cultural, and political life. This study explores everyday enforcement of international and internal mobility control, and the ways in which Africans respond to and resist the actions of security agents. I accomplish this using ethnographic evidence gathered when travelling over 10,000 miles in Burkina Faso, Mali, Ghana, and Cote d'Ivoire over a period of nine months. In addition, data were gathered through participant observation while crossing international borders 23 times in a sub-region of West Africa, and participating in 169 security control checkpoints in total. This evidence is supplemented by 29 interviews with transportation workers across the four countries studied. Augmenting the traditional social science literature on migrant networks with an approach proposed by development economists, this article shows that transportation workers play an essential role in mobility control in West Africa. The theoretical insights derived here contribute to a larger project of bringing borders and transportation into the same frame of reference as migration in academic study. This project sees movement through interaction, rather than simply through the systems approach so commonly applied in the literature and shows that in the countries under study there exist unstated, implicit social norms among transportation workers, their clients, and security agents, which constitute a key mechanism for migration.

Using a panel of 1042 American scientists in five disciplines and fixed effects models, we found an inverted U-shaped relationship between network average tie strength and citation impact, because an increase in tie strength on the one hand facilitates the collaborative knowledge creation process and on the other hand decreases cognitive diversity. In addition, when the network average tie strength is high, a more skewed network performs better because it still has a ""healthy"" mixture of weak and strong ties and a balance between exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, the tie strength skewness moderates the effect of network average tie strength: both the initial positive effect and the later negative effect of an increase in tie strength are smaller in a more skewed network than in a less skewed one.

It presents, through a series of four propositions, a three-stage supply network typology to help scholars and managers consider how best to develop these innovations. This typology was constructed by reviewing existing iustainability frameworks that argued that innovation was a key factor in sustainability. Moreover we found little consideration given on how to discover and develop eco-innovations. The literature proposes that a firm with strong ties with a few strategic suppliers will benefit from the knowledge and technology that spills over from suppliers to the firm during the new product development process. In contrast, the network literature explains that the creation of multiple weak ties to non-strategic suppliers may increase opportunities for identifying innovation. The network literature further suggests a third and potentially more promising route: building weak ties to suppliers that bridge 'structural holes' in the network. We suggest that strong ties with strategic suppliers will lead to the development of incremental eco-innovations while weak ties with multiple suppliers and with suppliers that bridge structural holes will tend to lead to radical eco-innovations. Finally, we suggest that once ecoinnovations are developed they should be embedded in the operational processes of other suppliers to increase the sustainability performance of the focal firm.

Here we augment a hierarchical social network model with communication between and within communities. We argue that organization into communities would decrease overall decentralized search times. We take inspiration from the biological immune system which organizes search for pathogens in a hybrid modular strategy. Our strategy has relevance in search for rare amounts of information in online social networks and could have implications for massively distributed search challenges. Our work also has implications for design of efficient online networks that could have an impact on networks of human collaboration, scientific collaboration and networks used in targeted manhunts. Real world systems, like online social networks, have high associated delays for long-distance links, since they are built on top of physical networks. Such systems have been shown to densify i.e. the average number of neighbours that an individual has increases with time. Hence such networks will have a communication cost due to space and the requirement of building and maintaining and increasing number of connections. We have incorporated such a non-spatial cost to communication in order to introduce the realism of individuals communicating within communities, which we call participation cost. We introduce the notion of a community size that increases with the size of the system, which is shown to reduce the time to search for information in networks. Our final strategy balances search times and participation costs and is shown to decrease time to find information in decentralized search in online social networks. Our strategy also balances strong-ties (within communities) and weak-ties over long distances (between communities that bring in diverse ideas) and may ultimately lead to more productive and innovative networks of human communication and enterprise. We hope that this work will lay the foundation for strategies aimed at producing global scale human interaction networks that are sustainable and lead to a more networked, diverse and prosperous society.",2016"Mikhaylov, N.; Fierro, I.; Beaumont, E.",THE INFLUENCES OF CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES CHOICE ON INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT STUDENTS' COLLABORATIVE KNOWLEDGE CREATION: TURKEY AND ECUADOR,"INTED2016: 10TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE","The paper presents the first phase of international (three countries) study that explores the influence of social capital and personal learning networks (PLN) development approaches used by international management students in multicultural learning environments and the types of social and academic networks they develop on their collaborative knowledge and cross-cultural competence development, in particular, on their preparation for international careers. A comparative analysis is conducted within three international programs (in Turkey, Ecuador and UK) that offer international education in English language for local and international students. The paper presents the preliminary results of a comparison in two locations - Turkey and Ecuador. The study applies the concepts of collaborative knowledge development, social capital and social networks. The study uses constructivist grounded theory [1] to uncover the process of social capital and collaborative knowledge creation. Based on the data, collected through semi-structured interviews, and analyzed through dimensional analysis [2]; [3], the study develops a process model, which takes into account the core social identity of the learner, as well as the existing and emergent social personal learning ties, built on social capital. An additional goal of the study is to uncover the overlapping social and personal learning networks international and local students participate in and develop, to trace the knowledge sharing routes and to pinpoint knowledge creation hubs in these networks. As the result of the study, recommendations are developed for higher educational institutions (HEIs) and multinational enterprises (MNEs) regarding the steps they can take to promote collaborative and cross-cultural knowledge creation among their members. The connectivism theory of social learning [4] suggests loose and pragmatic ties appropriate to knowledge sharing and creation in the interconnected networked social reality of the 21st century as they combine social and informational resources that operate in a chaotic environment and recognize rather than create patterns of meaning. While we are not proposing any final theoretical models at this point, it is likely that the learners who are engaged in multi-dimensional and loosely connected PLNs characterized by multiple networks consisted of weak ties and who utilize problem solving models of knowledge creation are more likely to become cross/interculturally competent and are more likely to be prepared for global careers. However, the preliminary findings show that international students lack the skills and desire to create functional PLNs and tend to engage in multiple binding networks characterized by strong emotional bonds but limited knowledge creation. While is it premature at this stage to suggest any specific steps that IHEIs and other multicultural learning environments might take to encourage social and technological networking among international students and other members of academic environment, some tentative recommendations are presented.",2016"Wu, Bo; Chen, Kang; Shen, Haiying",SPread: Exploiting Fractal Social Community For Efficient Multi-copy Routing in VDTNs,"2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS (ICNC)","In this paper, we focus on the multi-copy routing in Vehicle Delay Tolerant Networks (VDTNs). In current multi-copy routing, the different copies of each packet search the destination node independently, which leads to a low utilization of copies since they may search through the same path repeatedly without cooperation. To solve this problem, we propose a fractal Social community based efficient multi-coPy routing in VDTNs, namely SPread. First, we measure social network features in Vehicle NETworks (VNETs). Then, by taking advantage of weak ties and fractal structure feature of the community in VNETs, SPread carefully scatters different copies of each packet to different communities that are close to the destination community, thus ensuring that different copies search the destination community through different weak ties. In the routing of each copy, current routing algorithms either fail to exploit reachability information of nodes to different nodes (centrality based methods) or only use single-hop reachability information (community based methods), e.g., similarity and probability. Here, the reachability of node i to a destination j (a community or a node) means the possibility that a packet can reach j through i. In order to overcome above drawbacks, inspired by the personalized PageRank algorithm, we design new algorithms for calculating multi-hop reachability of vehicles to different communities and vehicles dynamically. Therefore, the routing efficiency of each copy can be enhanced. Extensive trace-driven simulation demonstrates the high efficiency of SPread in comparison with state-of-the-art routing algorithms in DTNs.",2016Ye Chao; Wang Lin; Rong Zhihai; Wang Xiaofan,Promoting Cooperation by Pigouvian Tax with Peer-Information and Social Mechanism,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 35TH CHINESE CONTROL CONFERENCE 2016,"Two important issues in evolutionary game theory are to understand the mechanisms of how peer pressure can promote cooperation among large scale of self-interested individuals, and how Pigouvian tax with peer-information and social mechanism can avoid the tragedy of the commons. We propose and compare two models based on game. In Pigouvian tax with peer-information model, individuals with cooperation behaviors receive rewards and their opponents are noticed with this information. Thus the peer pressure promotes the opponents with defection behaviors to cooperate intuitively. While in social mechanism model, individuals receive rewards cooperation behaviors and peer pressure. The effect of social mechanism depends on the level of social relationship. We find the enhancement of cooperation of both mechanisms in high level of peer pressure. Furthermore, we find the phenomenon of retaliatory action in weak ties between individuals in social mechanism model.

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative research design operationalized via case studies was followed for the empirical analysis. Empirical findings are based on the analysis of the 84 narrative reports submitted by school libraries as part of a national performance evaluation exercise that took place between 2010 and 2012. Data analysis followed the techniques of inductive data categorization, within case-analysis, and cross-case analysis. Findings - The exploration of the relational capabilities that school libraries in the Alentejo region of Portugal develop for acquiring new knowledge that exists externally in the community resulted in the identification of relationships that school libraries in the region have established to acquire new knowledge: connecting with and supporting organizations committed to civic engagement; facilitating discussions about challenging issues through strategic partnerships; convening community conversations to identify shared concerns and solutions; and embracing local culture to foster endogenous development. Originality/value - The ability to seek and recognize the value of new and external knowledge, assimilate it and apply it to organizational ends has been traditionally linked to the concept of absorptive capacity. While absorptive capacity literature in business settings is prolific, literature that focuses on school libraries' ability to identify and explore external knowledge and applying it to improve their performance is scarce. Focusing on the specific context of the Alentejo region of Portugal as an archetypical rural area, this paper identifies how knowledge existing externally in the community is absorbed by rural school libraries through specific relational capabilities that reflect school libraries' community orientation and engagement in participatory processes that develop social resilience.",2016"Kovacic, Helena; Rus, Andrej",INNOVATIONS IN ORGANISATIONS: AN INTEGRATIVE FRAMEWORK,Teorija in Praksa,"Current research on innovations builds extensively on network analysis demonstrating how different characteristics of social networks affect the ability of organisations to secure a continuous flow of innovation. This research, however, is highly fragmented, emphasising different features of social networks having an effect on various types of innovation at different organisational levels. The result is a plethora of research findings that do not systematically inform the subject matter or provide clear guidance for practitioners in organisations. In this paper, we address this gap and propose an integrative framework to help bring the divergent streams of research together and contribute to a better understanding of organisational innovation. We propose to distinguish between two dimensions: innovation type and organisational level. These distinctions robustly describe characteristic organisational contexts in which innovation takes place.

Social recommendation methods are capable of battling the critical cold-start issue, and thus can greatly improve prediction accuracy. The main intuition is that through trust and influence, users are more likely to develop affinity toward items consumed by their social ties. Despite considerable work in social recommendation, little attention has been paid to the important distinctions between strong and weak ties, two well-documented notions in social sciences. In this work, we study the effects of distinguishing strong and weak ties in social recommendation. We use neighbourhood overlap to approximate tie strength and extend the popular Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) model to incorporate the distinction of strong and weak ties. We present an EM-based algorithm that simultaneously classifies strong and weak ties in a social network w.r.t. optimal recommendation accuracy and learns latent feature vectors for all users and all items. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation on four real-world datasets and demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pairwise ranking methods in a variety of accuracy metrics.",2016"Momeni, Naghmeh; Rabbat, Michael",INFERRING NETWORK PROPERTIES FROM FIXED-CHOICE DESIGN WITH STRONG AND WEAK TIES,2016 IEEE STATISTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING WORKSHOP (SSP),"Studies of networked systems typically begin by obtaining information about the network structure. In many settings it is impractical or impossible to directly observe the network, and sampling is used. Sampling the structure of offline social networks is especially costly and time-consuming Respondents are asked to name close friends and acquaintances (strong and weak ties). However, because a person may have a large number of acquaintances, surveys use a fixed-choice design where respondents are asked to name a small, fixed number of their weak ties. Surprisingly, studies based on fixed-choice designs then directly use the network derived from the responses without correcting for the bias introduced by fixed-choice sampling. In this paper we demonstrate how to account for fixed choice sampling when inferring network characteristics. Our approach is based on the generalized method of moments.

The probability of connecting a node u with node v through a weak tie is proportional to 1/|uv|alpha, where |uv| is the grid distance between u and v and alpha >= 0 is the parameter of the model. Complex contagion refers to the propagation mechanism in a network where each node is activated only after k >= 2 neighbors of the node are activated. In this paper, we propose the concept of routing of complex contagion (or complex routing), where at each time step we can select one eligible node (nodes already having two active neighbors) to activate, with the goal of activating the pre-selected target node in the end. We consider decentralized routing scheme where only the links connected to already activated nodes are known to the selection strategy. We study the routing time of complex contagion and compare the result with simple routing and complex diffusion (the diffusion of complex contagion, where all eligible nodes are activated immediately in the same step with the goal of activating all nodes in the end). We show that for decentralized complex routing, the routing time is lower bounded by a polynomial in n (the number of nodes in the network) for all range of a both in expectation and with high probability (in particular, Omega(n(1/alpha+2)) for alpha <= 2 and Omega(n(alpha/2 alpha+2)) for alpha > 2 in expectation). Our results indicate that complex routing is exponentially harder than both simple routing and complex diffusion at the sweetspot of alpha = 2.",2016"Lin, Tao; Guo, Fangzhou; Wu, Yingcai; Zhu, Biao; Zhang, Fan; Qu, Huamin; Chen, Wei",TieVis: Visual Analytics of Evolution of Interpersonal Ties,E-LEARNING AND GAMES,"Interpersonal ties, such as strong ties and weak ties, describe the information carried by an edge in social network. Tracking the dynamic changes of interpersonal ties can thus enhance our understanding of the evolution of a complex network.

In this paper, we introduce a new visual analytics method that enables interactive analysis and exploration of the dynamic changes of interpersonal ties. The method integrates four well-linked visualizations, including a scatterplot, a pixelbar chart, a layered graph, and a node-link diagram, to allow for multi-perspective analysis of the evolution of interpersonal ties.

Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine this influence with a focus on the key expected risk tolerance determinants: client financial literacy, trust in the financial advice service, and relationship length with the service. A new theoretical model and related hypotheses were proposed and tested using survey data from financial adviser clients in Australia (N=538). Results revealed a positive relationship between client risk tolerance and investment decision-making. Further, client trust and relationship length with the service were found to be positively associated with client financial literacy and risk tolerance.

Previous literature has tended to focus on either strong ties or many weak ties with a largely unstated assumption that some degree of trade-off exists between the two (underlying trust and novel knowledge, respectively) and their relative contribution to innovation. Within the context of R&D in a SA MNC, this research provided evidence that tie breadth and tie strength are complementary in team innovation. The previously-documented tension between novelty and trust however remains present and becomes evident in the location of ties. Both strong and weak ties contribute most to innovation if they are neither too close (i.e., own team) nor too distant (i.e., outside the MNC). Instead, ties inside the greater R&D unit contributed most to innovation. This role of the location of ties suggests that studies of networks cannot remain limited to tie breadth and strength but has to be rooted in the specific context. This is consistent with prior evidence of innovation within mature and process-driven industries where an in-depth understanding of organisation knowledge is required rather than that of novel technologies.

To facilitate this splitting, we measure the strength of the tie among a pair actors based on the reciprocity of their relationship and the number of their shared or mutual friends. We hypothesize that the network composed of strong ties is expected to be rich in closure triads, whereas the network composed of weak ties is expected to be rich in brokerage triads. We test our hypotheses on four popular online social networks (OSNs), namely, Facebook, Twitter, Slashdot and YouTube. Empirical analysis reports that most networks composed of strong ties comprise both brokerage and closure triads, leading to the rejection of the first hypothesis. On the other hand, all networks composed of weak ties except for Slashdot comprise a significant number of only brokerage triads, leading to the acceptance of the second hypothesis.

The analysis of 13 classes shows that interethnic friendship nominations are indeed less often characterized by co-occurring trust, perceptions of helpfulness, or jointly spent spare time than intra-ethnic ones. This association holds true for self-declared ethnicity as well as peer perceptions of ethnicity. Focusing on the self-declared ethnicity of students, interethnic friendship nominations are also found to be less frequently reciprocated than intra-ethnic ones.

Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on semi-structured interviews with rural innovative entrepreneurs and regional key informants. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to identify configuration of relationships, and content analysis to understand the nature of the knowledge relationships. Findings - Higher innovation levels are related to proactive and strong relationships with extra-local actors, usually from the international level, mainly from the Baltic Sea region. The actors, who have a greater role in innovation, are special customers, scientific organisations and non-human actors (e.g. trade fairs). Greater variety in proactive relationships helps achieve higher-level innovations. Reactive and weaker relationships tend to be related to lower innovation levels. Originality/value - This study contributes to the development of rural innovation research practice through the development of a framework for analysing the configuration of knowledge networks and the nature (activity and strength) of relations between actors. Thus, two different dimensions not used together previously are combined and advanced.

Design/methodology/approach - Using self-reports from 100 tenured/tenure-track faculty at a US-based university, partial least squares (PLS) path models are run to test the extent to which researchers' individual innovativeness (Iinnov) affects the number of COs they produced taking into account the tie strength (TS) of a researcher to other conversational partners. Iinnov is determined by the specific indicators obtained from researchers' interactions in the early stage of their collaborative network activities. Findings - The results indicate that researchers' Iinnov positively affects the volume of their COs. Furthermore, TS negatively affects the relationship between researchers' Iinnov and the volume of their COs, which is consistent with the famous ""Strength of Weak Ties"" theory. Practical implications - By investigating the degree of impact of researchers' Iinnov on their CO, college administration could be informed regarding the extent that the social cohesion formed by interpersonal ties affects or drives the collaboration activity that results in COs. When this paper is extended to the entire university, university administration would know the capability of the different colleges, or even the university as a whole, in transforming the ideas embedded in researchers' networks into a productive work in a collaborative manner.

Mixed effects logistic regression analysis was used to test both main effects of business and owner characteristics on advice-seeking and interactions with type/location of peer advisors. Findings - Most owners had received advice from peers, and one-third had received advice online from a peer whom they had never met in person. Business performance was not associated with overall use of peer advice, but did interact significantly with source; the use of online-only advisors was associated with business growth, suggesting the possible benefit of weak ties. Over two-thirds of respondents reported having used social media and/or online forums to access advice or support from other owners (both those met in person and those not), with women and younger owners more likely to rely on such tools.

Findings - The findings indicate that culture-embedded disaster communication plays important roles in increasing the effectiveness of disaster information and encouraging trust in the authenticity of locally based disaster information at the individual level. The findings also identify that strong ties and weak ties play different roles in disaster communication. The strong ties are more effective in facilitating information diffusion and encourage trust and community participation within the affected community. Furthermore, the weak ties are more effective in disseminating information to wider audiences, and have an indirect influence in encouraging trust by extending the offline social network owned by the affected community.

The primary statistical technique for assessing survey data collected from 358 Taiwan tenants is partial least squares analysis. Findings - Collective learning and absorptive capacity fully mediate the relationship between social capital and competitive advantage. Moreover, social capital has a significant influence on both collective learning and absorptive capacity. Practical implications - Tenant firms in industrial parks must develop effective management tactics for the nurturing of inter-firm relations to enhance collective learning and their absorptive capacity to acquire and exploit key strategic resources such as tacit and explicit knowledge. For specialized firms, close social interactions in specific contexts, mediated by collective learning and absorptive capacity to make up for their resource constraints, can heighten their competitive advantage. Originality/value - By demonstrating the impact of social capital on competitive advantage in the specific context of industrial parks, whose artificial environment encourages and promotes close social interactions among tenants, this paper overcomes previous and contradictory findings regarding the relationship between social capital and competitive advantage.

Design/methodology/approach - The specific research questions are what impact the entrepreneur's social capital has on his or her cognitive orientation in new product development; and to what extent and how social capital is dependent on the entrepreneur's cognitive orientation in the new venture innovation performance. Data were collected in a survey conducted in multiple waves on a sample of approximately 1,400 new ventures in the USA. Social capital is measured by the position generator method. Cognitive orientation is measured by the causal mapping method. Regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Findings - The results indicate that the entrepreneur's strong social ties with the scientific community and technology-orientated cognition drive research collaborations and ultimately contribute to new venture innovation. Research limitations/implications - Possible limitations are the low survey response rate, the spread of industries involved and respondents being the sole data source. Future research could use multiple data sources, increase the response rate by using other methods such as interviews and focus on a single industry or a set of related industries. Practical implications - The findings of this study can guide entrepreneurs to manage their social relationships actively. Entrepreneurs should proactively build strong ties with the scientific community at the start-up stage to improve their firms' innovation performance. In the domain of public policy, initiatives such as encouragement of cooperation between universities and entrepreneurs may help to create new venture innovations and stimulate the regional economy. Originality/value - This study contributes to the research on innovation and entrepreneurship by exploring the interrelationships among entrepreneurs' social capital, cognitive orientation and new venture innovation. It found that entrepreneurs' social capital at the start-up stage influences the characteristics of their cognitive orientation in new product development and ultimately new venture innovation.

Developed by Rogers, DoI posits that an innovation (i.e., idea, movement, or trend) is initiated within a culture. Then, it is diffused via particular channels across diverse cultures. Instead of evolving independently, innovations diffuse from one culture to another through various forms of contact and communication. In the context of this analysis, the objective is to examine how the diffusion of certain ideas, namely, abolishing the stigma associated with leprosy, could have improved the lives of Hawaiians. An important premise of this article is that the Hawaiian government barely applied the tenets of DoI, which is the reason why many people lost their lives. So, this article seeks to explore what could have been done to improve their situation and what pitfalls should be avoided in the future.",2016"Damstra, Alyt; Tillie, Jean",How crosscutting weak ties are established-the case of Muslims in Europe,JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES,"Building on the work of Granovetter [1973.

In this paper, the focus lies on weak ties that cut across ethnic boundaries, connecting Muslim immigrants to members of the ethnic majority in six European host societies. The aim is twofold: a descriptive analysis of the existence of those crosscutting weak ties amongst different groups of Muslim immigrants and an explanatory analysis focusing on the structural factors that make the establishment of such ties more likely. In the latter part, the native populations are also taken into account, allowing for a bidirectional perspective. Using ordinal logistic regression models, we found that emancipatory factors such as education and language skills are positively associated with having weak ties, whereas conservative values and religiosity decrease the likelihood of establishing many weak ties.

In this review we discuss several arguments to consider fertility as a socially embedded process. The notion of social embeddedness expresses the shift from the macro and micro levels of analysis to the meso level, disclosing the influence of weak ties (friends, peers and co-workers) and network mechanisms on bearing children and becoming parents. The integration of social influence models into the research on fertility behavior enables students to explain the gap between intentions to have a child and actually becoming a parent in terms of interaction between weak and strong ties. The impact of network mechanisms is tested for different number of births, timing of marriage, and transition to parenthood. Several types of network mechanisms are distinguished: social learning, social contagion, social pressure and social support. Social learning concerns circulation of relevant information and experience exchange with friends, peers and co-workers. Social support involves mobilization of strong and weak ties for material and emotional maintenance in pregnancy, childbearing, childcare, and decision making on new births. Social learning and social support play a decisive role in reducing uncertainty and costs related to childbearing and childcare, especially for countries will low levels of economic sustainability and generalized trust. Social contagion and social pressure are mechanisms that express vertical and horizontal processes of social diffusion related to the spread of social norms and settings on marriage and parenthood.

A longitudinal case study of past debates and future directions in knowledge management for development,JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,"Purpose - This paper aims to analyze how the debate around knowledge management for development has evolved over a 14-year period. Design/methodology/approach - The study was conducted in an inductive manner, seeking to identify key themes discussed on an online community on knowledge management for development. Analysis comprised observation of the online debate, as well as semantic (co-word) network analysis of a ""big data"" set, consisting of 14 years of email exchange. The results were verified with the members of the community in a focus group manner. Findings - In terms of content, the knowledge management for development debate remains strongly engaged with actual development discourse, and it continues to be rather oriented toward tools and methods. In terms of learning, the community appears highly inclusive, and provides fertile ground for in-depth knowledge sharing, but shows less potential for innovative influences. Research limitations/implications - The study contributes to literature on knowledge management in the non-profit sector by showing how heterogeneous communities in the development domain generate knowledge and shape discourse. More specifically, the paper contributes to knowledge management for development literature by providing a comprehensive overview of how the domain has evolved since its emergence. It also advances knowledge management by showing how inclusive networks can contribute to but also limit learning. Practical/implications - The study is of use to knowledge management professionals by showing not only the benefits but also the limitations of inclusive knowledge-sharing networks. Social/implications - The study provides important societal implications by showing which topics are most important to development practitioners, covering the period encompassed by the Millennium Goals.

Moreover, the moderating role of collaborative climate was investigated as protector against leaders' incivility. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed multi-level model was tested by surveying 312 health care providers nested within 42 work units at eight large hospitals in Iran. Multi-level regression analysis was used to analyze the data. Findings - The findings revealed that those team members experiencing incivility from their supervisors are more likely to show reluctance to share knowledge with team members and as a consequence this response further decreases team's creative performance. However, the climate of collaboration inside hospitals can buffer the negative impact of incivility on their readiness to share knowledge. Practical implications In team-based organizations, a supervisor's incivility can stifle the creative performance of his/her team through blocking the knowledge sharing of members.

Versatility in dimers suggests that working with different types of nodes are more beneficial than with similar ones. However, the triangles yield a different relation between type of co-actor and the success of lead nodes indicating the importance of higher-order motifs in understanding the properties of the underlying system.

The final sample comprised 302 students who participated in a 3 (tie strength: strong vs. weak vs. no tie) by 2 (experience: high vs. low) between-subject experiment. Multivariate analysis of covariance and bias-corrected bootstrapping analysis using the PROCESS macro were used to test the hypotheses. The results showed that tie strength and recommender experience positively affect message credibility and intentions. Further, recommender experience moderates the effect of tie strength on intentions, while the moderating effects on intention are mediated by message credibility. While prior research suggests that negative recommendations from people with strong ties affect message effectiveness, the results of the present study deviate from this and show that recommendations from weak ties are as persuasive as those from strong ties when the message is delivered by recommenders with experience.

The case of small hydraulic facilities construction,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the roles social networks play in households' contribution to the provision of small hydraulic facilities (SHFs) in rural China. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts a sample-selection ordered probit model (Greene and Hensher, 2010) to estimate the impacts of overall social-network intensity, of the number of strong ties (relatives), and of the number of weak ties (friends), using data on 1,064 representative households collected from three provinces (Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Shandong). Findings - The numbers of strong ties and weak ties both have significant impacts on households' willingness to contribute to SHFs provision, but only the latter has a significant impact on their level of contribution. More specifically, a one standard deviation increase in the number of weak ties (i.e. friends) is associated with a 6.6 percent increase in households' propensity of contributing more than 550 yuan and a 8.2 percent decrease in their propensity of contributing less than 100 yuan. Originality/value - This paper is the first to examine the impacts of social networks on households' contribution to SHFs provision in rural China.

The latter is frequently performed as a principal component analysis of individual survey data with subsequent aggregation to regional or national levels. The central focus of this paper is the interpretation of the diverging correlations observed between the dimensions elaborated on an individual and an aggregate level. We illustrate that the correlations of regionally aggregated components are the result of an improper application of a single-level model to a multilevel structure. This mechanism is demonstrated empirically by adopting results from the European Social Survey and elaborating dimensions of social capital from both individual and aggregate survey data for European regions. The findings clearly indicate that the observed ecological correlations are not simply spurious or inconsistent due to an ecological fallacy condition, but rather reflect the influence of regional driving forces. Researchers need to be more careful in taking account of the multilevel nature of the data in order to produce valid results. In fact, the often applied procedure of individual factorization and subsequent aggregation of data provides a mixture of the two level effects with potentially misleading implications.",2016"Richards, Lindsay",For Whom Money Matters Less: Social Connectedness as a Resilience Resource in the UK,SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH,"The current literature shows that both absolute and relative income are important for happiness, but there is little work emphasising how the strength of the relationship is dependent on personal and social factors. I hypothesise that social connectedness influences the money-happiness relationship because the effect of money is in part felt through the acquisition of social status, whereas status (and associated psychological benefits such as self-worth) can alternatively be gained through social connectedness. In particular, it is theorised that 'weak ties' when co-existing with good quality informal ties have a separable and additional benefit to subjective well-being, and that it is the socially isolated who have the most to gain from doing well financially. Social connectedness is conceptualised as a 'resilience resource' which has a buffering effect on subjective well-being. Data from the British Household Panel Survey are used, first to establish a measurement schema of connectedness using latent class analysis, and secondly in a multilevel model of life satisfaction with observations from seven consecutive years nested within individuals. The results show that connectedness makes a larger difference to satisfaction in times of financial stress, and that the satisfaction of the socially isolated can 'catch up' to some degree with those with larger networks when things are going well financially. The findings also confirm that those for whom money makes the smallest contribution to happiness are those with both strong and weak ties. Weak ties have an additional benefit compared to having strong ties alone. In summary, connectedness has the power to narrow the well-being gap that exists between times of financial struggle and times of relative comfort. It suggests that the psychological benefits of social integration have the capacity to displace money as a source of status and self-worth, and similarly that the importance of money may be exaggerated where these psychological gains are not available through other domains of life.",2016"Ueda, Yasutaka; Shaw, Rajib","Managing and bridging communities in temporary housing: case of the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in Kesennuma City, Japan",NATURAL HAZARDS,"Over the past years, many scholars emphasized the importance of maintaining social relations which were built before disasters into temporary housing communities. However, reality is that most of the temporary housing complexes need to develop newly community relations due to the difficulties of maintaining community ties built before disasters. This paper attempts to find community management issues in newly developed temporary housing communities and argues solutions to the issues of constructing social capital. Key findings from this study are summarized as follows: From bonding aspect, the challenges of community management in temporary housing are leadership, ownership, and participation. One of the suggestions to solve these challenges is to employ community organizers, and a union of existing neighborhood associations is supposed to be the community organizer. From bridging aspect, information sharing among presidents of the neighborhood association in temporary housing was effective for the improvement of community management in the neighborhood associations. If this information sharing is run by an external organization, the external organization can be a bridging organization to make weak ties among neighborhood associations, which overcomes negative impacts of social capital. From linking aspect, particularly housing reconstruction is a big concern for residents in temporary housing and gives impact to community management, and therefore, linking information on housing reconstruction process to management of neighborhood associations in temporary housing is significant. To foster three categories of social capital in temporary housing, key is a bridging organization as an external organization, which functions to link among neighborhood associations and neighborhood associations to external resources.",2016"Brashears, Matthew E.; Hoagland, Emily; Quintane, Eric",Sex and network recall accuracy,SOCIAL NETWORKS,"How does an individual's sex influence their recall of social relations? Extensive research has shown that social networks differ by sex and has attempted to explain these differences either through structural availability or individual preferences. Addressing the limitations of these explanations, we build on an increasing body of research emphasizing the role of cognition in the formation and maintenance of networks to argue that males and females may exhibit different strategies for encoding and recalling social information in memory. Further, because activating sex roles can alter cognitive performance, we propose that differences in recall may only or primarily appear when respondents are made aware of their sex. We explore differences in male and female network memory using a laboratory experiment asking respondents to memorize and recall a novel social network after receiving either a sex prime or a control prime. We find that sex significantly impacts social network recall, however being made aware of one's sex does not. Our results provide evidence that differences in male and female networks may be partly due to sex-based differences in network cognition. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We argue one way to solve this controversy is to examine the patterns of change in the use of weak ties and strong ties separately. Using pooled data from three cross-sectional surveys in urban China, the results show a steady increase in the use of weak ties and an increasing and persistent use of strong ties in finding jobs between 1978 and 2008. The results also show no systematic difference between the use of weak ties for finding jobs in the market sector versus the state sector.

Both countries have transformed from authoritarian regimes to democratic states, yet they differ in social, economic, and cultural institutions that may be common to the respective larger region where each is located. To sample the structure of each egocentric network, we extracted information from largely identical contact diaries collected in both countries, 51 from Taiwan and 138 from Hungary. After comparing sample characteristics, network size, and composition, we construct a Strength of Ties (SoT) index based on two objective and two subjective measures of ego-alter ties. We then use this index to analyze tie strength by the types of relationships. On average, the number of alters contacted in one week is much larger in Taiwan than in Hungary, and the gap remains unchanged after controlling for key socio-demographic background factors. Even though the four indicators that we use to construct the SoT index are distributed similarly among the respondents in both Taiwan and Hungary, the composite index pinpoints how the types of relationships play somewhat different roles across the nations. The findings imply that the tendency to maintain only the closest ties with kin and other close friends is linked to distrust in others, a possible ill effect lingering from the authoritarian past. The implication is partially supported by further analyses using the ISSP 2006 survey data.

Findings - The authors find that cross-relational network competence is a significant predictor of growth in internationally operating SMEs. This result is robust across measures among the firms. In comparison, the network competence of domestically operating SMEs is not related to their growth, and relationship-specific competence does not influence growth. Research limitations/implications - The study does not account for longitudinal aspect of competence development. Growth is measured by the growth in sales and assets, and there are other ways to measure organizational growth.

Despite these benefits, global adoption of MFA has been uneven, with some places seeing active participation, while others have seen limited growth. Recent conceptual models of MFA emphasize the potential for bottom-up processes and linkages among social and environmental systems to promote multifunctionality. Social networks are critical to these explanations but how and why these networks matter is unclear. We investigated fifty-three farms in three states in the United States (New York, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania) and developed a stylized model of social networks and systemic change in the dairy farming system. We found that social networks are important to RG adoption but their impact is contingent on social and spatial factors. Effects of networks on farmer decision making differ according to whether they comprise weak-tie relationships, which bridge across disparate people and organizations, or strong-tie relationships, which are shared by groups in which members are well known to one another. RG adoption is also dependent on features of the social landscape including the number of dairy households, the probability of neighboring farmers sharing strong ties, and the role of space in how networks are formed.

It also addresses the influence of learners choice on their collaborative knowledge increase, in particular, the knowledge related to preparation for international careers. A comparative analysis has been conducted within three international programs (in Turkey, Ecuador, and the UK) that offer international education in the English language. The paper presents the preliminary results of a comparison in two locations - Turkey and the UK. The study applies the concepts of collaborative knowledge development, social capital, and social networks. It uses the constructivist grounded theory [1] to uncover the process of social capital and collaborative knowledge creation. Based on the data, collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed through dimensional analysis [2]; [3], an updated process model is developed. The model takes into account the core social identity of the learner, and the stability of this identity, as well as the existing and emergent social, personal and institutional learning ties, built on social capital. An additional goal of the study is to uncover the overlapping social and personal learning networks International and local students participate in and develop, to trace the knowledge sharing routes and to pinpoint knowledge creation hubs in these networks. While we are not proposing the final theoretical model until the completion of the full cycle of the continuous comparison analysis process, it appears that the learners who are engaged in multi-dimensional and loosely connected [4] personal earning networks (PLN) [5] characterized by multiple networks consisted of weak ties and who utilize problem-solving models of knowledge creation are more likely to become cross/interculturally competent and are more likely to be prepared for global careers.",2016"Kazemargi, Niloofar",Supply Network in Open Innovation From Perspective of Social Network,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP (ICIE 2016),"Purpose - As the locus of knowledge has been extended beyond firms' boundaries, firms need to search outside for new knowledge to sustain their competitive advantages. The purpose of this study is to examine how a firm can manage and govern supply ties to access new knowledge, from the perspective of social network. We examine the role of interorganizational interactions and network structure in enhancing knowledge flow in inbound open innovation with suppliers. Design/methodology/approach - First, A systematic literature review methodology was adopted. The research design, given that the study of open innovation is still at a nascent stage, consists of an exploratory case study to provide an in- depth analysis. We adopt semi- structured interviews to examine the role of social network in knowledge flow in supply network. Findings - The findings of this paper add to the understanding of the role of inter- organizational interaction and network structure in enhancing knowledge transfer in open innovation practices. We propose that the implementation of open innovation with suppliers requires specific supply networks based on the interactions between buyer and suppliers. Building from the SLR, we extend the idea of tie strength by Granovetter (1973), and introduce two forms of strong ties; "" vital strong ties"" and "" overembedded strong ties"", and two forms of weak ties; "" potential weak ties"" and "" infant weak ties"". We propose how overembeddedness and future interaction influence governance modes. Research limitations/implications - Although the main contribution of this paper is in extending the body of literature in open innovation research by looking at social network theories, the current propositions have to be validated by empirical analysis. A qualitative case study is currently in progress. Therefore, we cannot go forward until the results of this case study allow a general contribution to be made and increase the validity of results. Practical implications - First, the paper suggests how social network theory can enhance inflow of knowledge from suppliers in open innovation projects. Second, we extend inter- organizational relationships by adding vital strong and potential weak ties. This classification allows us to examine effective governance modes even at the early stage of innovation. We propose that the expectation of future business with weak ties constrains opportunistic behavior of suppliers and affects knowledge flow positively in open innovation. As for potential strong ties, they should not be excluded from open innovation projects since they can provide valuable knowledge to speed up the innovation process. Our argument also encourages practitioners to actively and dynamically make and maintain networks with suppliers in order to gain access to new knowledge. Originality/value - This study marks one of the first attempts to explain the role of structural and relational dimensions of social network in different inbound open innovation approaches with suppliers. Additionally, this study is also the first to extend the literature on strong and weak ties.",2016"Riva, Giuseppe; Wiederhold, Brenda K.; Cipresso, Pietro",Psychology Of Social Media: From Technology To Identity,PSYCHOLOGY OF SOCIAL NETWORKING: PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN ONLINE COMMUNITIES,"From a psychosocial viewpoint social networks can be defined as ""digital spaces"" allowing users to manage both their network of social relationships (organization, extension, exploration and comparison) and their social identity (description and definition). Moreover, social networks allow the creation of hybrid social networks, at the same time constituted by virtual connections and real connections giving rise to 'interreality', a new social space, more malleable and dynamic than preceding social networks. The hybrid nature - both virtual and real - that characterises the social networks leads them to have two faces, made explicit with the following three paradoxes: If it is possible to effectively use social networks to change our social identity (impression management) it is also true that external intervention can more easily modify the way in which the other members of the network receive our identity (reputation management); If in the social network it is easier to decide how and what features to emphasize within the social identity (personal branding), it is also true that following the traces left by different virtual identities it is easier for others to rebuild our real identity (privacy management). 3. If the social networks, without making any distinction between strong bonds (close friends) and weak ones (acquaintances), enable us to manage with limited effort weak ties facilitating enlargement of the social network, at the same time the lack of difference may make us behave with weak ties alike with strong ties (disappearance of the division of social roles) with all the problems of this situation. In conclusion, if social networks are used by mature people responsibly they provide an excellent opportunity to interact socially, improve their interpersonal relationships, and even conduct business. On the contrary, when used in an irresponsible way by people who are too young it can cause problems and difficulties that in some cases even time cannot erase.",2016"Wang, Mingshu; Zhou, Jiangping; Long, Ying; Chen, Feng",Outside the ivory tower: visualizing university students' top transit-trip destinations and popular corridors,REGIONAL STUDIES REGIONAL SCIENCE,"Universities are where innovations, face-to-face interactions and social capital are commonplace. Nevertheless, often regarded as 'the ivory tower', universities cannot be separated from the social and economic transformations outside of them. Traffic, information and financial flows between universities and other locations can be used to reveal connections between the ivory tower and other locales. Therefore, this paper uses the weekday public transit smartcard records from 6 to 9 April 2010 (158,262 transit trips in total, including bus-only, bus plus subway and subway-only trips) to identify and profile the most popular destinations of student riders from the '985 universities' (a short list of top universities designated by the Chinese Central Government in 1999) and associated transit trip flows in Beijing.

This study looked at online and face-to-face networking behaviour among rural micro-enterprises in Scotland in relation to the development of bonding and bridging social capital. Given the challenges of remoteness faced by many rural businesses, online networking is particularly useful in developing bridging capital, but is an unsuitable context for building the trust needed to gain tangible benefits.

In this study, we examine these assertions empirically in a sample (n = 818) comprising active members of voluntary associations in a typical midsized Swedish community. We investigate whether people whom active members of voluntary associations have met through their voluntary activities are more or less likely to share their social characteristics than people whom they have met elsewhere. Our results show that acquaintances whom our respondents have acquired within voluntary associations are less likely to share several of their significant social characteristics than other members of their personal networks, but more likely to reside in their vicinity than others. Consequently, our results give fairly robust support to the ""integrating hypothesis"" according to which voluntary associations contribute to the social diversification of their members' personal networks.

Using a grounded theory approach to analyze narratives of interviewees recalling events, we coded sections of text using ""social relationship"" and ""response"" as sensitizing concepts. Results showed people relied most on immediate family when securing life. Networks expanded to friends, neighbors, professionals, and volunteers during non-life-threatening preparation and immediate recovery. Immediately before the disaster's impact, social networks extended outward into weak ties in a spirit of communitas. During long-term recovery, interviewees were most isolated and relied heavily on immediate family and professionals. The concepts of bridging and bonding social capital may be more important for understanding non-vital response, whereas strong and weak ties are more relevant for understanding evacuation and long-term recovery. Strong and weak ties best help explain post-disaster social stratification.

Weak ties were most likely to be broken, and respondents mostly unfriended people because they took offense at what they had posted or disagreed with it.

The study is based on 24 interviews with research and development (R&D) employees of a large supplier of R&D in the automotive sector. Results demonstrate that the poor operational quality of a repository hinders knowledge sourcing; thereby, people prefer sourcing knowledge from other colleagues rather than from the repository.

Thus for the future, identifying the changes in these can help us identify the possible birth of new gangs (sub-networks) in the social system. Furthermore, we study the dynamics of these networks globally and locally, and have identified the global characteristics that tell us that they are not random graphs-they are small world graphs-implying that the formation of gangs is not a random event. However, we are not yet able to conclude anything significant about scale-free characteristics due to insufficient sample size.

Yet union networks, particularly networks of delegates, and ways to build them, are still poorly understood. This is a study of the meaning that workplace union delegates assign to networks of support. It explores the characteristics of effective delegate and union networks and influences upon them. Effective networks are a combination of strong and weak ties, such that delegates sometimes do not recognise they are part of a network. Our three-stage research methodology involved delegate focus groups, a paper-based self-completion questionnaire of recently trained delegates (N=473) and a follow-up telephone survey (N=145). It found that organisers were key to creation of internal workplace networks (although they did not necessarily establish them) and in providing a bridge for delegates with external networks. They were the key support person for many delegates. Networks took a variety of forms. Only a minority were formalised. A majority were mainly internal to the workplace.

From a network theory perspective, employers value information about applicants' residency status, as it is conducive to reducing personnel management costs; information can be reliably obtained via these institutional linkages. Employers expect schools to use such information to select nominees. By using the data from the school's applicant pool, the results from logistic regression analysis showed that schools tend to nominate candidates who are living with their parents, and no candidates who lived without parents were hired.

Linking faculty's networks to stages of instructional development,HIGHER EDUCATION,"Research into faculty members' instructional development has primarily focused on individual skills and knowledge. As collegial interactions may support or constrain faculty's professional development in higher education, this study compared and contrasted the networks of faculty members in different stages of instructional development (novice, experienced non-expert, and experienced expert teachers). Faculty networks comprised the relations that teaching faculty members used to communicate about their teaching practice. To capture these networks, a total of 30 faculty members were interviewed. We used an egocentric network approach to examine the differences between the networks in network size, tie strength, and network diversity. Results based on analyses of variance and multilevel analyses suggested three key findings: (a) Faculty members in different stages of instructional development varied in the size of their network; (b) faculty members in different stages of development had access to different types of networks in terms of tie strength; and (c) faculty members in different stages of development varied in the diversity of teaching experience in their networks. Experienced expert teachers had larger, stronger, and more diverse networks compared with experienced non-experts. Novices also had larger networks, but they were characterized by lower tie strength and less diversity. These findings demonstrate that network development is not just a time-age effect, but suggests arrested development for experienced non-experts linked to limited network input. This provides important evidence for the role of collegial interactions throughout faculty's development as a teacher.

Social capital was measured by (1) psychometric measures of bridging and bonding social capital, and (2) core discussion network size using name generators, as well as the number of strong and weak ties within the core network. Controlling for sociodemographic variables, we found that bonding social capital was associated with lower odds of frequent or occasional health disruptions, but bridging social capital did not have any effect. Weak ties in the core network were associated with greater odds of health disruptions.

It is therefore imperative to understand how different contexts enable entrepreneurs to create opportunities. In this paper, we focus on the spatial context of rural entrepreneurs and explore how the rural context impacts on their opportunity creation. Based on a multiple case study, we find that rural entrepreneurs mix what we refer to as placial embeddedness - an intimate knowledge of and concern for the place - with strategically built non-local networks, i.e. the best of two worlds.

To these ends, we developed a conceptual model of dyadic marketing-oriented and network-oriented communication exchanges (i.e., interorganizational antecedents), interorganizational networking consequences, and business performance. Specifically, interorganizational networking consequences were examined in terms of tactical and strategic cooperation, whereas business performance was examined in terms of adaptability, productivity and efficiency.Methodology/approach: To set the hypotheses of the study we delved into the wide stream of marketing literature pertaining to interorganizational networks and business-to-business relationships, and specifically to the marketing orientation theory, the social network theory, and the IMP approach. These research hypotheses were tested using advanced statistical analysis and causal modeling. The research sample comprised 1,000 business-to-business international companies, which were mostly U.S., and European and were randomly selected from the yahoo.com business-to-business companies' subdirectory. The data collection involved a two-wave e-mail survey, in which the quantitative research instrument was emailed to the respective marketing directors' personal accounts. Totally 249 high ranking marketing executives responded, thus yielding a 24.9% response rate. The selected data were, then, subjected to rigorous advanced statistical analysis of structural equation modeling, using the AMOS21 statistical package, to test reliability and stability of selected measures and validity of the research model, as a whole.Findings: Overall, the research findings provided sufficient evidence that the proposed model was robust. Moreover, the findings supported that communication exchanges that deploy within a wide array of participants (i.e., within a network of organizational members, customers, partners, and other interacting partners within a market), may have stronger explanatory powers upon a company's networking effects and business performance, than communication exchanges that evolve merely at a dyadic company-customer level.Originality/value/contribution: This research is original; that is, it deals with empirical, quantitative data and makes an attempt to combine marketing concepts mainly from 3 marketing streams studying the long-term business-to-business relationships. Our approach is based on existing marketing literature, suggesting that networks, apart from being embedded in previous relationships and interactions, they may also be based on more loosely coupling between organizations. Thus, we use the IMP approach to formulate the measures of our study; however, we don't discriminate between strong and weak ties in relationship bonding. In this research we focus on specific communication behaviors that may nurture interorganizational networking and look for effects upon cooperation and business performance. The research findings imply that marketing executives would worthwhile expand their communication exchanges beyond their narrow customers', or providers' network, to the wider array of trustworthy business circle, as such a behavior may largely favor their companies' adaptability to environmental changes, flourish innovation, and lead to synergies in efficiency and productivity gains.",2015"Mayer, Julia M.; Jones, Quentin; Hiltz, Starr Roxanne",Identifying Opportunities for Valuable Encounters: Toward Context-Aware Social Matching Systems,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS,"Mobile social matching systems have the potential to transform the way we make new social ties, but only if we are able to overcome the many challenges that exist as to how systems can utilize contextual data to recommend interesting and relevant people to users and facilitate valuable encounters between strangers.

Findings from two studies are presented. The first, a survey study (n = 117) explored the concept of contextual rarity of shared user attributes as a measure to improve desirability in mobile social matches. The second, an interview study (n = 58) explored people's motivations to meet others in various contexts. From these studies we derived a set of novel context-aware social matching concepts, including contextual sociability and familiarity as an indicator of opportune social context; contextual engagement as an indicator of opportune personal context; and contextual rarity, oddity, and activity partnering as an indicator of opportune relational context.

Thus, it is relevant to know how network dimensions (i.e., network centrality, structural holes, and tie strength) may influence the content selection by receivers. This raises the question of what determines such content selection. These relationships are empirically tested by using both social network data and participants' survey data. Findings show that despite the fact that degree and strength of tie are associated with central positions in the network, they are not related to individuals' choices of contents. Findings also suggest that structural holes in association with the emotion of surprise, used as a proxy for the perception of novelty, offer a good representation of people's behavior when they select contents. These are valuable arguments to enhance content personalization with new perspectives for receivers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While the recent hypothesis of maximum information entropy is presented as the possible origin of effective navigation in small-world networks. We find there exists a competition between information entropy maximization and homophily in local structure through both theoretical and experimental analysis. This competition suggests that a newly built relationship between two individuals with more common friends would lead to less information entropy gain for them. We demonstrate that in the evolution of the social network, both of the two assumptions coexist. The rule of maximum information entropy produces weak ties in the network, while the law of homophily makes the network highly clustered locally and the individuals would obtain strong and trust ties.

In Study 1, we investigate how de-energizing relationships are related to lower performance using data from 161 people in the information technology (IT) department of an engineering firm. In Study 2, in a sample of 439 management consultants, we consider whether the effects of de-energizing relationships on performance may be moderated by the extent to which an individual has the psychological resource of thriving at work.

I develop a theoretical account of how networks defined by formal, semiformal, and informal organizational structure change in response to heightened ambiguity. I argue that, when ambiguity increases, people will tend to (1) decrease communication with formal network ties that do not have a significant semiformal component, (2) increase communication with semiformal network ties that do not have a significant formal component, and (3) increase communication with informal network ties. Empirical support for these propositions comes from unique data-including 40 weeks of archived email metadata, the full roster of email distribution lists, personnel records, and qualitative interviews-that span the period before, during, and after an ambiguity-producing restructuring at a large information services firm.

Third parties can be either shared or unshared. Shared third parties signal insider status and have a predictable positive effect on knowledge transfer. Unshared third parties, however, signal outsider status and are believed to undermine knowledge transfer. Surprisingly, unshared third parties have been ignored in empirical analysis, and so we do not know if or how much unshared third parties contribute to the process. Using knowledge transfer data from an online technical forum, we illustrate how unshared third parties affect the rate at which individuals initiate and sustain knowledge transfer relationships. Empirical results indicate that unshared third parties undermine knowledge sharing, and they also indicate that the magnitude of the negative unshared-third-party effect declines the more unshared third parties overlap in what they know. Our results provide a more complete view of how third parties contribute to knowledge sharing. The results also advance our understanding of network-based dynamics defined more broadly.

Yet two key research questions remain unanswered: which of a person's many dormant ties provide the most value, and which are advice seekers most inclined to choose as reconnection targets? In the current study, we asked executives to seek advice on an important work project from two dormant ties (their first, most preferred choice plus one selected randomly from their next nine most preferred choices) and to respond to surveys before and after their reconnections. This two-stage design allowed us to make causal inferences about the executives' advice-seeking preferences and the value of reconnecting certain types of dormant ties. Our results show that the most valuable reconnections are to people who provide novelty (by not having spent much time together in the past and having higher status) as well as engagement (by being trustworthy and willing to help). Our executive participants, however, preferred neither novelty nor engagement. Rather, the prospect of reconnecting can make people feel anxious. To avoid this discomfort, executives preferred contacts with whom they had spent a lot of time together in the past, thereby actually reducing novelty. Thus, our findings identify critical biases in executives' reconnection preferences as well as insights into how to make more effective reconnections.

A number of variations are subject to gendered influences; in addition, men and women make differing use of brokers.

Recent findings from social and biological networks pinpoint the significant role of weak connections in network coherence and mediation of information from segregated parts of the network. In the current study, inspired by such findings and proposed architectures pertaining to social networks, we examine the structure of weak connections in the macaque cortico-cortical network by employing a tract-tracing dataset. We demonstrate that the cortico-cortical connections as a whole, as well as connections between segregated communities of brain areas, comply with the architecture suggested by the so-called strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis. However, we find that the wiring of these connections is not optimal with respect to the aforementioned architecture. This configuration is not attributable to a trade-off with factors known to constrain brain wiring, i.e., wiring cost and efficiency. Lastly, weak connections, but not strong ones, appear important for network cohesion. Our findings relate a topological property to the strength of cortico-cortical connections, highlight the prominent role of weak connections in the cortico-cortical structural network and pinpoint their potential functional significance.

In practice, however, collecting all connections between agents in social networks can be hardly achieved. As a result, such metrics could be difficult to apply to real social networks. Consequently, a new approach for identifying influential people without the explicit network information is demanded in order to provide an efficient immunization or spreading strategy, in a practical sense. In this study, we seek a possible way for finding influential spreaders by using the social mechanisms of how social connections are formed in real networks. We find that a reliable immunization scheme can be achieved by asking people how they interact with each other. From these surveys we find that the probabilistic tendency to connect to a hub has the strongest predictive power for influential spreaders among tested social mechanisms. Our observation also suggests that people who connect different communities is more likely to be an influential spreader when a network has a strong modular structure.

We use analytic extreme value thresholds to identify a new class of indispensable super ties, the strongest of which commonly exhibit >50% publication overlap with the central scientist. The prevalence of super ties suggests that they arise from career strategies based upon cost, risk, and reward sharing and complementary skill matching. We then use a combination of descriptive and panel regression methods to compare the subset of publications coauthored with a super tie to the subset without one, controlling for pertinent features such as career age, prestige, team size, and prior group experience.

Random-effects longitudinal negative binomial models were used to predict depression and delinquency, controlling for social connection variables to account for selection bias. Findings suggest peer depression and delinquency are both predictive of youth delinquency, while peer influences of depression are much more modest. Youth who are more connected to parents and communities and who are more popular within their networks are more susceptible to peer influence, while self-regulating youth are less susceptible. We find support for theories of popularity-socialization as well as weak-ties in explaining social network factors that amplify or constrain peer influence.

CR is the extent to which one contributes content that is meaningful, insightful and constructive to aid learning and by social network properties we refer to its structural, position and relationship attributes. Analysis of data collected from an e-learning environment shows that rather than performance, social learning correlates with properties of social networks: (i) structure (density, inter-group and intra-network communication) and (ii) position (efficiency), and (iii) relationship (tie strength). In particular, individuals who communicate with internal group members rather than external members express higher tendencies of ""content richness"" in social learning. The contribution of this study is three-fold: (i) a theoretical development of a social network based model for understanding learning and performance, which addresses the lack of empirical validation of current models in social learning; (ii) the construction of a novel metric called ""content richness"" as a surrogate indicator of social learning; and (iii) demonstration of how the use of social network analysis and computational text-mining approaches can be used to operationalize the model for studying learning and performance. In conclusion, a useful implication of the study is that the model fosters understanding social factors that influence learning and performance in project management. The study concludes that associations between social network properties and the extent to which interactions are "" content-rich"" in eLearning domains cannot be discounted in the learning process and must therefore be accounted for in the organizational learning design.",2015"Kim, Yusoon; Choi, Thomas Y.","Deep, Sticky, Transient, and Gracious: An Expanded Buyer-Supplier Relationship Typology",JOURNAL OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT,"The cooperative-adversarial dichotomy has served as the prevailing buyer-supplier relationship typology in the literature. Cooperative buyer-supplier relationships have been associated with closely tied relationships, while adversarial relationships have been equated to arms-length relationships. We propose, however, that this perspective is overly simplified; a cooperative relationship is orthogonal to a closely tied relationship and an adversarial relationship to an arms-length relationship. That is, there can be a closely tied yet adversarial relationship and an arms-length yet cooperative relationship. We theorize the buyer-supplier relationship in two orthogonal aspects(1) relational posture, that is, how two firms regard each other (as cooperative partners or as adversaries) and (2) relational intensity, that is, how much two firms' operations are interlinked (closely tied or arms-length). By considering the two aspects concurrently, this article proposes an expanded typology of buyer-supplier relationships. We label a closely tied and cooperative buyer-supplier type as deep; a closely tied but adversarial type as sticky; an arms-length and adversarial type as transient; and an arms-length but cooperative type as gracious. We then present an analysis that supports the orthogonality of the two relational dimensions. This analysis suggests that the expanded relationship types are associated with different relational outcome trade-offs. The data are collected from a global, large Japanese automaker and 163 of its suppliers in North America. Overall, the results provide empirical support for the expanded buyer-supplier relationship typology.",2015"Kohlbacher, Josef; Reeger, Ursula; Schnell, Philipp",Place Attachment and Social Ties - Migrants and Natives in Three Urban Settings in Vienna,POPULATION SPACE AND PLACE,"With ongoing immigration from 'all over the world', European cities are realising that the local level is gaining importance as a setting for interethnic coexistence. In this article, we investigate the attachment of migrants and natives to their local context in three neighbourhoods (one better-off, two more deprived) in Vienna that differ in contextual, structural, and socio-economic characteristics. We ask how the place attachment of natives and migrants is related to weak and strong social ties. In all three neighbourhoods, we found a majority of residents reported high or medium levels of attachment proving that urban neighbourhoods are still important contexts for local residents. A closer look revealed differences across groups and research areas: The strongest place attachment is displayed by natives in the middle-class area of Laudongasse, with migrants being significantly less attached, but still more than migrants (and natives) in the two deprived settings. In social housing (Am Schopfwerk), migrants are more attached than natives, whereas in Ludo-Hartmann-Platz, the difference is not significant. The first result is that obviously deprivation reduces individual place attachment. In contrast to previous studies we found that socio-demographic factors are not relevant, it is social contacts that are important in explaining local attachment. For natives and migrants alike, close ties in the neighbourhood raise local attachment. Small talks are relevant for migrants but not for natives. This is in line with previous studies emphasising the special relevance of weak ties for migrants in supporting the integration process in a new environment.

This study uses longitudinal data based on the email communication from Enron Corporation prior to its demise and couples qualitative coding techniques with social network analysis to understand the effects of corruption on communication behavior. By contrasting the evolution of corrupt and noncorrupt projects at Enron, I examine how corruption influences the way individuals attempt to remain undetected while sharing information. Although transitive communications were not different at the projects' onsets, the members of corrupt projects communicate less and have fewer reciprocal relations than the noncorrupt project members. But as the corrupt project members' tenure on a project increases, their behavior tends to become more similar to the behavior of the noncorrupt project members. Potential mechanisms are explored to explain this finding. This study provides insight into how corruption is coordinated within firms over time and highlights the role of information in understanding the emergent properties of social networks.",2015"Barbulescu, Roxana",The Strength of Many Kinds of Ties: Unpacking the Role of Social Contacts Across Stages of the Job Search Process,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,"The topic of job mobility has received increasing attention in recent years. Yet, surprising in light of the wealth of research on social networks and job attainment, we do not have a unified model of the impact of different kinds of social contacts on job search success. In this paper I show that contacts are differently beneficial for job seekers depending on the stage of the job search process that job seekers are engaged in. Specifically, three stages of the job search process can be distinguished in which social contacts fulfill different roles for the job seekers: deciding the types of jobs for which to apply, submitting job applications, and preparing for interviews. I propose that contacts who are spread across different occupations are conducive to applying to more types of jobs, yet it is contacts who are more focused across occupations that are beneficial for being invited to more interviews-relative to the number of job types applied for-and for converting the interviews into offers. In addition, contacts with lower relationship depth with the job seeker are more helpful for getting invited to interviews, whereas contacts who have more frequent interactions with the job seeker are more helpful for converting interviews into offers. Analyses using a unique longitudinal data set on the job searches of 226 participants in an MBA program offer robust evidence in support of the hypotheses. The results suggest that external mobility is best enabled when job seekers engage with-and learn from-different kinds of contacts across stages of the job search process.",2015"Cross, Rob; Ernst, Chris; Assimakopoulos, Dimitris; Ranta, Daniel",Investing in boundary-spanning collaboration to drive efficiency and innovation,ORGANIZATIONAL DYNAMICS,,2015"Lee, Byeong Cheol",The impact of social capital on tourism technology adoption for destination marketing,CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM,"The purpose of the present study is to examine the impact of social capital on destination marketing organisations' (DMOs) technology adoption, especially Web 2.0.

First, messages over five successive weeks (2 May 2011 to 13 June 2011) were randomly selected from the HIV/AIDS Weibo Group on Weibo. Next, we employed social network analysis to map the HIV/AIDS Weibo Group's structure and to measure the study variables. After that, a multivariate analysis of variance was applied to examine the influence of frequency of contact and reciprocity on informational and emotional social support exchanged in each dyad. The results revealed that pairs with a high level of contact frequency or reciprocity exchanged more informational support than do pairs with a low level of contact frequency or reciprocity. Moreover, dyadic partners with high frequency of contact exchanged a larger amount of emotional support than those with a low level frequency of contact; but strongly reciprocal dyads did not exchange significantly more emotional social support than their counterparts with a low level of reciprocity.",2015"Fujimoto, Kayo; Wang, Peng; Ross, Michael W.; Williams, Mark L.",Venue-Mediated Weak Ties in Multiplex HIV Transmission Risk Networks Among Drug-Using Male Sex Workers and Associates,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,"Objectives. We investigated the structural characteristics of a multiplex HIV transmission risk network of drug-using male sex workers and their associates. Methods. Using a sample of 387 drug-using male sex workers and their male and female associates in Houston, Texas, we estimated an exponential random graph model to examine the venue-mediated relationships between individuals, the structural characteristics of relationships not linked to social venues, and homophily. We collected data in 2003 to 2004. The network comprised social, sexual, and drug-using relationships and affiliations with social venues. Results. Individuals affiliated with the same social venues, bars, or street intersections were more likely to have nonreciprocated (weak) ties with others. Sex workers were less likely than were other associates to have reciprocated (strong) ties to other sex workers with the same venues. Individuals tended to have reciprocated ties not linked to venues. Partner choice tended to be predicated on homophily. Conclusions. Social venues may provide a milieu for forming weak ties in HIV transmission risk networks centered on male sex workers, which may foster the efficient diffusion of prevention messages as diverse information is obtained and information redundancy is avoided.",2015"Erikson, Emily; Samila, Sampsa",Social Networks and Port Traffic in Early Modern Overseas Trade,SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY,"Individuals engaged in overseas trade in the early modern period often faced high levels of uncertainty regarding their prospects for trade.

We consider the possible impact of strong and weak ties and the use of ties under different types of uncertainty. The analysis suggests that social networks encouraged trade at port cities with already high rates of traffic, though this effect is less pronounced than for other means through which information was distributed throughout the trade system.",2015"Brady, Gerard",Network Social Capital and Labour Market Outcomes: Evidence For Ireland,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW,"Using data from the International Social Survey Programme 2008 this paper tests empirically the effects of network social capital on Irish employment outcomes, while attempting to account for possible endogeneity.

The research theorizes the importance of strong and weak ties to men and women in each sending country as a product of the gender equity gap in economic participation (low/high) and incidence of female-led families (low/high). The findings reveal that ties to men increase the odds of migration from countries where gender equity and incidence of female-led families are low, while ties to women are more important for migration from countries where gender equity and female-led families are high. Previous research on migration and social capital details the importance of network ties for providing resources and the role of gender in mediating social capital quality and access to network support.

The research showed that due to the large cultural distance between the Vietnamese and Polish societies as well as the specific socio-cultural characteristics of Vietnamese immigrants (e.g. strong ethnic identity and a high level of in-group ties) the concept of adaptation should be reconsidered and a more holistic approach should be taken. From an individualistic perspective, a strategy of separation was most visible among the Vietnamese, whereas from a group and culturally sensitive perspective a strategy of collective and intermediate integration was predominant in this group along with collective social mobility. Vietnamese immigrants who were integrated with Polish society, such as pioneer immigrants, Vietnamese leaders, the spouses of Poles and representatives of the 1.5 and 2nd generations played the role of cultural brokers. They mediated between their compatriots and Polish society. Thus the integration of the majority of immigrants took place through the agency of the representatives, who also had a key role in the formation of the Vietnamese enclave. In the case of Ukrainian migrants the close cultural distance between the Polish and Ukrainian societies as well as the volume and density of relations between Ukrainian immigrants and Poles (including very frequent mixed marriages) primarily led to assimilation and individual social mobility. Cases of migrants operating in transnational social spaces which encompass Ukrainians, Poles and migrants from other post-Soviet countries remained rare. Ukrainian immigrants mainly based their adaptation on bridging capital accumulated in strong ties ( which was related to their Polish spouses and cultural assimilation), whereas the Vietnamese migrants predominantly used bridging capital generated in weak ties as a resource for adaptation.",2015"Rawlings, Craig M.; McFarland, Daniel A.; Dahlander, Linus; Wang, Dan",Streams of Thought: Knowledge Flows and Intellectual Cohesion in a Multidisciplinary Era,SOCIAL FORCES,"How has the recent shift toward multidisciplinary research affected intellectual cohesion in academia?

Social and cognitive uses of technology were empirically shown to have a positive, albeit indirect, effect on employees' routine and innovative job performance. Hedonic use of the technology, while having a direct negative impact on routine performance was shown to positively contribute to the development of social ties, leading to a mitigating positive influence on innovative performance.

Therefore, these communities attract registered members who are focused on knowledge sharing. The current research examines whether network ties, which are an aspect of structural social capital that can be categorized into strong and weak social ties, can provide a non-trivial explanation for members' trust, reciprocity, and identification in a virtual community for website programming interest. This relationship enables us to examine a context in which members share a common goal of resolving programming problems through knowledge sharing in contrast with other community settings where only general topics are discussed (e.g., societal and emotional issues). Data were collected through a survey of a virtual community for website programming composed of 69 members. Affirming conventional perception, results of the study indicate that weak ties affect the level of generalized trust and facilitate group identification. Remarkably, the number of members' strong ties is not significantly related to the degree of their perceived norms regarding generalized reciprocity Reciprocity refers to a mutual expectation that a benefit granted at present should be repaid in the future. The results suggest two key points. First, even for a virtual community of interest, weak ties overshadow strong ties in explaining the outcome variables. Second, reciprocity is not guaranteed even in a focused form of discussion with a non-social topic that involves specialized knowledge. Therefore, virtual community members should be cautious even if ties are strong.

We discuss the concept of interpersonal relationships within the context of Chinese culture by embedding the guanxi concept into a model to investigate the relationships among the three dimensions. We used a survey-based methodology to collect data from 230 employees of the top 100 high-technology firms in Taiwan and structural equation modelling (SEM) with LISREL 8.54 to examine the hypotheses model. The results indicated that at the individual level, guanxi is positively related to both trust and norms, which are also positively related to knowledge sharing. The mediating effects of trust and norms were also found to be significant. Trust directly influences knowledge sharing, and plays a mediating role between knowledge sharing and guanxi. This suggests that knowledge sharing is likely to occur when trust exists among employees. The results further indicate that norms mediate the relationship between guanxi and knowledge sharing. Guanxi among members influences knowledge sharing; therefore, organizations require a feasible solution using the relational norms mechanism.

From January 2011 to September 2013, 41 family group conferences were organised in a Dutch public mental health care setting and studied using a qualitative case study methodology. Twenty-three of the conferences were successful in meeting their goals. This article reports on findings from the other 18 family group conferences that apparently had failed as the preparations became stuck or because a plan was never reached or fully implemented. Semi-structured interviews with 118 out of a possible total of 215 FGC participants were conducted to examine the process and impact of the conferences. Findings The interviews indicate that conferences were often held as a last resort, in situations where professional care had already failed prior to the conference. The intended goals of the conferences were not achieved because support from the social network was insufficiently mobilised and clients themselves felt helpless that they could improve their conditions. Applications A single conference seems insufficient on its own to break through a sense of inadequacy and paralysis. Social capital theory points to the necessity of not only renewing informal networks (strong ties') but of expanding networks through connecting public mental health care clients to paid and volunteer work (weak ties'). FGC plans can include such action steps. Instituting a family manager' to monitor these steps may support the bonding of strong ties' and the bridging to weak ties'.",2015"Hsieh, Yuli Patrick",Check the phone book: Testing information and communication technology (ICT) recall aids for personal network surveys,SOCIAL NETWORKS,"This study tested two recall aids for the name generator procedure via a randomized web experiment with 447 college students, eliciting their personal networks. Compared to participants solely presented with the name generator, participants being prompted and probed to consult records saved in their communication devices provided more comprehensive network data and more weak ties. Furthermore, these data were garnered without either a substantial increase in item nonresponse or a decrease in completion time for subsequent name interpreters. Thus, ICF recall aids are deemed cost-effective and context-neutral techniques to improve the recall accuracy of data collected by the name generator. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Manzoor Ahmed",Building Social Networks for Maternal and Newborn Health in Poor Urban Settlements: A Cross-Sectional Study in Bangladesh,PLOS ONE,"Background The beneficial influence of social networks on health and wellbeing is well-established. In poor urban settlements in Bangladesh, BRAC's Manoshi programme trains community health workers (CHWs) to support women through pregnancy, delivery and postpartum periods. This paper test the hypothesis that the introduction of CHWs as weak ties into the social networks of Manoshi members mediates improvements in maternal and neonatal health (MNH) best practices by providing support, facilitating ideational change, connecting mother to resources, and strengthening or countering the influence of strong ties. Methods 1000 women who had given birth in the last three months were identified and interviewed as part of ongoing monitoring of 5 poor urban settlements in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A social networks questionnaire was administered which elicited women's perceived networks around pregnancy, delivery and post-partum periods. Mediation analysis was performed to test the hypothesis that penetration of Manoshi CHWs into women's perceived networks has a beneficial effect on MNH best practises. Results The presence and influence of Manoshi CHWs in women's networks significantly mediated the effect of Manoshi membership on MNH best practices. Respondents who were Manoshi members and who listed Manoshi CHWs as part of their support networks were significantly more likely to deliver with a trained birth attendant (OR 3.61; 95% CI 2.36-5.51), to use postnatal care (OR 3.09; 95% CI 1.83-5.22), and to give colostrum to their newborn (OR 7.51; 95% CI 3.51-16.05). Conclusion Manoshi has succeeded in penetrating the perceived pregnancy, delivery and post-partum networks of poor urban women through the introduction of trained CHWs. Study findings demonstrate the benefits of moving beyond urban health care delivery models that concentrate on the provision of clinical services by medical providers, to an approach that nurtures the power of social networks as a means to support the poorest and most marginalized in changing behaviour and effectively accessing appropriate maternal services.",2015"Neville, Brendan; Fasli, Maria; Pitt, Jeremy",Utilising social recommendation for decision-making in distributed multi-agent systems,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,"Open multi-agent systems are typically formed from heterogeneous peers operating in a decentralised manner. Hence, their constituent agents must evaluate possible actions and opportunities based on local, subjective knowledge. When agents have insufficient personal experience, they may inevitably rely on their social connections to act as a source of relevant information or recommendations. We describe an agent-mediated electronic market for investigating social interaction within the context of evolving heterogeneous distributed networks. In our scenario, consumers look for appropriate services and this service choice is informed via peer recommendations. We define two alternative algorithms for selecting peers based on perceived similarity and we evaluate them on their ability to organise an overlay network such that it acts as a passive filter, tailoring the information that agents use to select services in the market. We use this scenario to explore the link between the peer selection algorithms and the emergent network topologies, as well as the impact of the peer selection algorithm on the agents' performance in choosing services based on peer recommendations. Our simulation results demonstrate a qualitative difference in the behaviour of the algorithms, with optimal algorithm selection relying on information regarding the preferences of the wider population of agents.

YouTube, especially, is rife with celebrity commemorations. Examining fans' online mourning practices on YouTube, this paper examines video tributes dedicated to the late Steve Jobs, with a focus on collective remembering and collective construction of memory. Combining netnography with critical discourse analysis, the analysis focuses on the user comments where the past unfolds in interaction and meanings are negotiated and contested. The paper argues that celebrity death may, for avid fans, be a source of disenfranchised grief, a type of grief characterised by inadequate social support, usually arising from lack of empathy for the loss. The paper sheds light on the functions digital memorials have for mourning fans (and fandom) and argues that social media sites have come to function as spaces of negotiation, legitimisation and alleviation of disenfranchised grief. It is also suggested that when it comes to disenfranchised grief, and grief work generally, the concept of community be widened to include communities of weak ties, a typical form of communal belonging on social media.",2015"Pei, Qingqi; Yan, Dingyu; Ma, Lichuan; Li, Zi; Liao, Yang",A Strong and Weak Ties Feedback-Based Trust Model in Multimedia Social Networks,COMPUTER JOURNAL,"The multimedia social network (MSN), a combination of the multimedia sharing technology and social network, has prominent social features and diffusion characteristics. Owing to its centerlessness and lack of regulation, MSNs have some serious network environment problems, such as spread of negative digital content and serious data redundancy. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a strong and weak ties feedback-based trust model in MSNs on the basis of the Weak Ties Theory of sociology. This model evaluates the trust level from two different aspects, multimedia content and user behaviors, and computes the reputation value by the Bayesian estimation principle and the damped window mechanism. On the basis of the trust model, we establish a trust-based information dissemination model in MSNs to study the relationship between trust and digital content dissemination. Simulation results indicate that the trust model is reliable in design, valid in network transmission, and effective in resisting malicious feedback and collusive attacks, enables positive digital data to spread rapidly and widely, and limits the dissemination of negative content.",2015"Peng, Jianping; Quan, Jing; Zhang, Guoying; Dubinsky, Alan J.","Knowledge Sharing, Social Relationships, and Contextual Performance: The Moderating Influence of Information Technology Competence",JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND END USER COMPUTING,"A firm's core competitiveness results primarily from its ability to innovate. Knowledge sharing plays an important role in promoting sustained innovation. This research examines two factors that enable employee knowledge sharing. Using responses from a questionnaire that was distributed to professionals in a research and development (R&D) department of a Chinese commercial elevator firm, the investigation examines whether social relationships and contextual performance influence knowledge sharing through the moderating effect of employee IT competence. Study findings reveal that social relationships-which include both the degree of centrality of the employee's social network and frequency of interpersonal interaction-and employee contextual performance have a significant positive impact on knowledge sharing.

We show that, in denser areas, individuals choose to interact with more people and meet more random encounters (weak ties) than in sparsely populated areas. We also demonstrate that, for a low urbanization level, there is a unique steady-state equilibrium where workers do not interact with weak ties, while, for a high level of urbanization, there is a unique steady-state equilibrium with full social interactions. We show that these equilibria are usually not socially efficient when the urban population has an intermediate size because there are too few social interactions compared to the social optimum. Finally, even when social interactions are optimal, we show that there is over-urbanization in equilibrium. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We suggest that spatial bridging ties are important to the development of social capital within a community, as they help to overcome a tendency for ties to be spatially proximate (the propinquity effect). Using ego-based network data, we examined the formation of spatial bridging ties within a new urbanist subdivision (NUS) and also identified specific design features of the NUS that were associated with such ties. We found an association between spatial bridging ties and the use of mixed-use amenities, suggesting that mixed-use amenities (e.g., local shops and restaurants) may be facilitating spatial bridging ties between residents in NUS communities.

We analyze a distributed team within a large multinational firm involved in software development and delivery activities and find that highly engaged employees have personal networks that are anchored locally (i.e., strong ties with colleagues who are collocated and more transitive triples) and connect globally (i.e., strong ties with distant colleagues and more liaison brokerage ties across geographic locations).

The aim of the study is to disentangle the types of ties that are formed between ethnic minority and majority youth. Moreover, the article will examine how these ties build bridges across group boundaries in the form of providing new leisure resources for ethnic minority youth. The qualitative data of the study consists of multi-sited ethnography conducted in the context of youth work and distinct interview data of ethnic minority youth (n=38). Strong interethnic ties in the form of close friendships are rare in the data. Instead, many weak ties in the form of distant acquaintances are maintained. However, because of manifold micro-level elements, these weak ties are often too fragile to function as bridges accumulating the leisure resources of ethnic minority youth. Strong interethnic ties seem to have more bridging qualities. Thus, the conceptual distinction of weak/bridging and strong/bonding ties originally formulated in the framework of the labour market may not be applicable in the fields of youth leisure.",2015"Evans, Joel M.; Hendron, Michael G.; Oldroyd, James B.",Withholding the Ace: The Individual- and Unit-Level Performance Effects of Self-Reported and Perceived Knowledge Hoarding,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,"This paper investigates knowledge hoarding, defined as an individual's deliberate and strategic concealment of information, and perceived hoarding, defined as coworkers' beliefs that an individual is engaged in hoarding. We hypothesize that knowledge hoarding increases an individual's job performance by enhancing bargaining power and influence, whereas perceived hoarding decreases the individual's job performance because coworkers withdraw social support. We further suggest that knowledge hoarding and perceived hoarding are both detrimental to unit performance because they hurt work-related interactions and impair the unit's ability to respond quickly to problems. Using a sample of 297 individuals embedded in 41 units in the U.S. Forest Service, we find that the positive effect of hoarding on individual performance is mediated by bargaining power, whereas the negative effect of perceived hoarding on individual performance is mediated by social support. In addition, individual hoarding and perceived hoarding both diminish unit performance.

Evidence shows that I-C values are indicators of how people construct their social networks and use strong/weak ties as a behavioral reference. Specifically, when compared with individualists, collectivists tend to hold larger strong-tie networks and endow strong ties with greater interpersonal influence. Results obtained from agent-based modeling indicate that individualistic cultures are more effective at propagating collective action when one of the two following conditions is met: (1) people have a strong motivation to participate and (2) the connectivity of the social system is low. In contrast, spread of collective action in collectivistic cultures is more effective when motivation is not strong and the connectivity of the social system is high. These findings call for a serious consideration of the role of culture in collective action. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, there are fundamental differences between SNS and traditional peer groups. It is therefore likely that peer influence operates differently in SNS. The present study examines the role of network size and functional form of the relationship between individual and peer deviance in online networks. Methods: Data for these analyses come from a survey of 583 undergraduates at a mid-southern university. Empirical analyses rely on a series of multivariate negative binomial regression models. Results: Findings indicate there is a nonlinear relationship between exposure to criminal behavior online and self-reported offending. Network size moderates this relationship. Respondents embedded in the smallest networks exhibit a linear association between peer and individual behavior, while those in the largest networks display a saturation point, after which exposure to additional deviance becomes redundant. Conclusions: The current study expands upon the emerging body of criminological research exploring the implications of online environments as venues for social learning. We showcase how processes of peer influence operate in online social networks and potentially affect criminal behavior. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Many of the cohabiting couples in our sample met through friends and family members who can be considered strong ties.

Findings show that not only do host-and home-country embeddedness increase knowledge transfer success, but they also interact positively. At the organizational level, however, the presence of other returnees in a home-country workplace decreases the positive effect of a returnee's host-country embeddedness, whereas the similarity of a returnee's industry background to the home-country industry increases it. At the country level, high xenophobia in a given home country diminishes the positive effect of host-country embeddedness but increases the positive effect of home-country embeddedness.

Both colleagues inside organizations and external parties have frequently been proposed as important sources of information and knowledge within this part of the innovation process. Other contributions addressing social networks and innovation bring into focus the potentially negative effects that certain network structures may have on innovation, pointing to inconsistencies in received theory. In order to address these inconsistencies, an empirical study of ideation in a Swedish multinational firm was performed, taking into account two different knowledge creation processes - combination and in-depth analysis - and their inter-relationships with organizational distance between contributing individuals. Data was collected using a survey and was analysed using regression models. It was found that different levels of organizational distance correlate with different knowledge creation processes. In-depth analysis occurred more often with employees' close colleagues, whereas the combination of existing ideas and information was more frequent in interaction with employees' close colleagues and with external parties. Both these interaction patterns were also found to be positive for the generation of patents, whereas no such relationship could be seen when individuals interacted with colleagues in other departments in the same firm.

The distribution of social capital in social-ecological systems can determine who is more productive at extracting ecological resources and who emerges as influential in guiding their management, thereby empowering some while disempowering others. Despite its importance, the factors that contribute to variation in social capital among individuals have not been widely studied. We adopt a network perspective to examine what determines social capital among individuals in social-ecological systems. We begin by identifying network measures of social capital relevant for individuals in this context, and review existing evidence concerning their determinants. Using a complete social network dataset from Hawaii's longline fishery, we employ social network analysis and other statistical methods to empirically estimate these measures and determine the extent to which individual stakeholder attributes explain variation within them. We find that ethnicity is the strongest predictor of social capital. Measures of human capital (i.e., education, experience), years living in the community, and information-sharing attitudes are also important. Surprisingly, we find that when controlling for other factors, industry leaders and formal fishery representatives are generally not well connected. Our results offer new quantitative insights on the relationship between stakeholder diversity, social networks, and social capital in a coupled social-ecological system, which can aid in identifying barriers and opportunities for action to overcome resource management problems.

So far, such programmes have yielded mixed success. While partnerships between international, national and local organisations have become the pre-eminent model for RET programmes, we know relatively little about their contribution. This article traces the role of renewable energy partnerships in development cooperation, shifting the analytical emphasis from barriers and drivers to key actors and their relationships. It presents a relational approach for the analysis of development assistance for renewable energy, drawing on theories concerning the role of strong and weak ties in inter-organisational networks. Through an analysis of seven empirical cases from Central America, the article provides insights into how different forms of inter-organisational relationships can facilitate implementation of RET programmes but do not necessarily enhance the capacities of local organisations in a way to support a more sustainable adoption of RETs.

In this framework, emerging needs, such as content dissemination, social discovery and question and answering, advocate the raising of novel communication paradigms where the binding content-recipients is not provided by the sender (in the classical IP addressing style), but directly executed by specific recipients with interest in it. This paper proposes a novel communication protocol, named InterestCast, or ICast, solving the problem for a wide range of social scenarios and applying to an opportunistic network whose nodes are the personal devices of moving individuals, possibly interacting with fixed road-side devices. The protocol is able to chase users' interests decoupling content tags from locations and social communities. In order to cross community boundaries and reach farthest destinations, ICast adopts mechanisms that properly extract weak ties, i.e. encounters between nodes that rarely interact, but that connect different communities. The main advantages the proposal achieves are: it ensures remarkable performance results; it is simple and feasible and it keeps computational and networking costs low; it can preserve users' privacy.

Thus, a growing body of research has been looking into the relationship between social capital and Internet usage. This research has been showing a positive relationship between them; however, results are not as conclusive when we consider one of the main dimensions of social capital: bonding. Bonding relates to resources that are embedded in one's strong ties (i.e., family members and close friends). The study of bonding is of particular sociological interest, since the discussion around the social effects of the Internet still suggests that it takes time away from strong ties and that is more useful to connect with weak ties (i.e., acquaintances). This study examines the relationship between bonding and the Internet, using representative survey data and semi-structured interviews from Portugal. Findings show that bonding is predicted positively by Internet use but negatively by age. On one hand, the Internet seems to compensate for the negative age effect because older adults who use it are more likely to have a high level of bonding.

Our work evaluates this assumption. We collected call and SMS logs and ground truth relationship data from 36 participants.

A number of recent research efforts have studied relationships between geolocation and social connectivity, social connectivity and preferences, and node attributes and strength of social ties. These efforts have successfully demonstrated prediction of various attributes based on social connectivity, mobility, dynamic checkin information etc., including prediction of user location as well as future checkin locations. In this paper, we study the relationship between shared checkin locations and the structure and nature of social ties. We argue that typical LSBNs are in fact composed of layers of networks of varying structure and function, and that it is possible to deconcolve these networks through effective statistical analysis of shared checkins. In this context, we pose and validate the following hypotheses: (i) a large number of shared checkins imply social connectivity; however, social connectivity does not imply statistically large number of shared checkins; (ii) entities in social ties that share a large number of checkins tend to be strongly clustered. We hypothesize that such strong ties (for example, family ties, friendships etc.) carry higher influence compared to weaker ties (mere acquaintances) in the social network; and (iii) social ties that have statistically fewer shared checkins (weak ties) tend to be less clustered than the underlying (baseline) network. We hypothesize that such ties (for example professional ties, friends of friends, acquaintances etc.,) carry less influence.

In this research, we consider whether the deduced relationships between members of the community constitute weak ties. A deduced relationship exists when two community members view or access the same resource. If these deduced relationships do constitute weak ties then other theorized network properties should also be manifest, namely homophily and triadic closures. Our findings support these theoretical conjectures. Firstly, results indicate that the strength of a tie is directly proportional to the level of similarity between users in the network (homophily property). Secondly, we found strong support for the triadic closure property as well; we developed a computational model to predict the formation of weak ties via triadic closures with an accuracy of 97.8%.

SNSs have grown in both popularity and use. They allow individuals to articulate their social networks by developing a list of other members on the site with whom they share a connection. These platforms also allow companies to create profiles to promote their brands. However, many firms have jumped into SNSs by creating a ""brand page"" without fully understanding how to spread it successfully. Design/methodology/approach - Two experiments were developed. In the first one, the authors manipulated how the individual comes to know about brand pages. Participants discovered a brand page through a friend with whom they have either a strong tie or a weak tie. In the second experiment (2 x 2), the authors manipulated tie strength (strong vs weak) and the type of recommendation (active vs passive). Findings - Results of the first study show that as the individual has more experience in Facebook (measured in this paper through satisfaction, past behavior of following brands and Facebook intensity), the effect of tie strength on the intention to join a brand page dilutes. The second study confirms Study 1 and shows that strong ties exert more influence than weak ties when the brand page is actively recommended by Facebook friends. Practical implications - This paper shows that the influence of strong ties is particularly important for individuals with low levels of experience in Facebook. As experience in SNSs is expected to continue growing, managers should not forget the role of weak ties as a source of information for their networked friends. Strong ties only remain more influential than weak ties when the information about the brand page is received through an invitation.

Hence, SC provides the essential infrastructure for knowledge creation. A fresh approach to operationalising the concept of SC through social network analysis and content analysis is thus required. This paper develops and explores the conceptual relationships between knowledge creation and SC in the context of two live building projects. There are two main conclusions.

Previous research on food security and social network analysis has mostly focused on egocentric network data or proxy variables for social networks to explain how social relations contribute to the different dimensions of food security. Whole-network approaches have the potential to contribute to former studies by revealing how individual social ties aggregate into complex structures that create opportunities or constraints to the sharing and distribution of food resources. We used a whole-network approach to investigate the role of network structure in contributing to the four dimensions of food security: food availability, access, utilization, and stability. For a case study of a riparian community from the Brazilian Amazon that is dependent on fish as a key element of food security, we mapped the community strong-tie network among 97% of the village population over 14 years old (n = 336) by integrating reciprocated friendship and occupational ties, as well as close kinship relationships. We explored how different structural properties of the community network contribute to the understanding of (1) the availability of fish as a community resource, (2) community access to fish as a dietary resource, (3) the utilization of fish for consumption in a way that allows the villagers to maximize nutrition while at the same time minimizing toxic risks associated with mercury exposure, and (4) the stability of the fish resources in local ecosystems as a result of cooperative behaviors and community-based management.

The measures for the three movements predict the strength of support for the respective movements' goals quite well, especially well if mobilization was high as for the anti-nuclear movement at that time. Movement organization is measured by types of ego-centric networks of supporters of the anti-nuclear movement. A distinction is made between strong and weak ties, the latter ones identified by relationships to adherents of the anti-nuclear movement beyond the people with whom one discusses important matters most frequently.

Utilising Fletcher and Harris' (2012) framework for understanding knowledge acquisition processes in internationalisation, this study investigates the importance of direct and indirect roles played by third parties in the networking for internationalisation processes of three different firm types within the knowledge-based natural health products (NHPs) (pharmaceutical) sector in Canada. The research presented here examines nine case studies of Canadian NHP firms and reveals that they utilised all network-related internationalisation processes simultaneously to internationalise including Johanson and Mattsson's (1988, 1994) network theory, Johanson and Vahlne's (2003) updated the Uppsala Model and the resource-based perspective on network theory (Ruzzier et al., 2006). They networked with and extensively utilised third parties, including government bodies, trade associations, government advisors, consultants and other domestic networks with international ties, in Canada and internationally to gain technical, market and internationalisation knowledge, and direct and indirect experiential knowledge which contributed to the internationalisation process confirming the study by Fletcher and Harris (2012). In a departure from the literature, this study found that weak ties (Granovetter, 1973) developed with third parties who were new to the networks allowed the NHP firms to develop competitive advantages necessary for them to overcome the liability of outsidership in entering new international markets. The type of technical, market and internationalisation knowledge gained, its content and the direct and indirect sources of knowledge from third parties were all shown to contribute to the internationalisation process.",2015"Cho, Vincent; Hung, Humphry",Sending mobile messages to different social ties in modern urban life How do anxiety and time-shortage matter?,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & PEOPLE,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of mobile messaging for the purposes of information sharing and social networking based on the types of social ties involved. The authors identify two psychological traits in the model: perceived time shortages (TSs) and anxiety trait. These traits can influence individuals' mobile-messaging usage by facilitating users' connections to different social ties in modern urban life. Design/methodology/approach - The authors distributed questionnaires at random on the streets of certain densely populated areas in Hong Kong to young urbanites, who are the dominant users of technological social media. The authors collected 492 valid responses, which the authors analysed via multivariate regression analysis. Findings - Mobile messages are more effectively used to share information within strongly tied groups rather than weakly tied groups. However, there is little difference between weakly and strongly connected groups in terms of the perceived effectiveness of mobile messages used for social networking. Anxious people are more inclined to send mobile messages to individuals with whom they have weak ties, and people who perceived TSs send more mobile messages to individuals with whom they have strong ties. Research limitations/implications - The rapid nature of information and communication technology has enabled new ""richer"" forms of mobile media. For instance, WhatsApp allows people to attach images and other multimedia files to their messages, and WeChat provides a location-sharing service that enables users to meet new people based on their friendship preferences. Future studies should examine this trend. Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature by elaborating the mobile-messaging behaviour of urban citizens who are anxious and perceive TSs within strongly and weakly connected social groups.",2015"Jin, Chang-Hyun",The moderating effect of social capital and cosmopolitanism on marketing capabilities A comparison of Chinese and Korean companies,CHINESE MANAGEMENT STUDIES,"Purpose - The aim of this study was to examine the role of top management's social capital - focusing on specific components of social capital - in shaping a company's marketing capabilities. In addition, the study was designed to determine the extent to which cosmopolitanism as a top management's characteristic serves as a moderator that allows top management's social capital to influence corporate marketing capabilities. Design/methodology/approach - This study's sample comprised small- and medium-sized companies in Korea and China. After excluding insincere responses, 636 questionnaires ( 329 from Koreans, 307 from Chinese) were used for the analysis. A mediated hierarchical regression analysis was performed to verify the hypothesis. Findings - This study proposed the hypothesis that top management's social capital would have positive effects on corporate marketing capabilities: pricing strategies, product development, distribution strategies and marketing communications. While managerial tie utilization and solidarity were revealed to have positive effects on corporate marketing capabilities, trust did not show statistically significant effects. Research limitations/implications - This study is subject to several limitations. First, it has not fully addressed various foundational concepts or factors that comprise or facilitate the building of social capital. In addition to trust and the sharing of core values and knowledge among organizational members, there may be other factors involved, so systematic studies should be conducted using a model that can review the roles of various explanatory variables that constitute social capital. Practical implications - This study's empirical results contribute valuable data to the literature, as it was based on a survey conducted with actual Korean and Chinese top managers. In addition, the study's findings are likely to suggest a valuable direction for evaluating corporate marketing strategies and business performance. The study identified powerful effects of top management's social capital on corporate marketing strategies. Therefore, greater investments should be made to build the top management's social capital, so that the corporate capacity for marketing strategies will be able to produce maximum effects. Social implications - The results of this study suggest the following additional points. A company with a high level of cosmopolitan orientation may have excellent strategies for competing on overseas markets. Companies targeting global markets should leverage accumulated top management's social capital to discover overseas business opportunities and acquire knowledge of overseas markets. When the corporate executives of companies that attempt to make inroads into overseas markets have such a cosmopolitan orientation and actively seek and seize overseas market opportunities, they are more likely to avoid path dependency, following domestic business activities and become successful in those global markets. Originality/value - The present study segmented social capital into sub-factors, thereby identifying their relationships with the behavioral outputs of corporate executives, such as business practice processes, marketing capabilities and business performance. Based on the findings of this study, top management's social capital should enable companies to consolidate corporate business practice capabilities and, eventually, to be seen as closely associated with business performance and the essential qualities and characteristics of top managers.",2015"Koo, Dong-Mo","The strength of no tie relationship in an online recommendation Focused on interactional effects of valence, tie strength, and type of service",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING,"Purpose - This paper aims to investigate whether the interactional effects of recommendation valence, tie strength and service type produce different effects on attitude and buying intention in a social networking context. Design/methodology/approach - A 2 x 3 x 3 between-subject experiment was carried out, involving 616 participants, and MANOVA was used to test hypotheses. Findings - The interactions of valence by tie strength and valence by service type affect attitude, but not intention. The review valence x tie strength x service type interaction influences both attitude and intention, and its effect on intention is fully mediated by attitude. Research limitations/implications - Negative recommendations for credence and experiential services communicated by individuals with no-tie relationships have a strong negative effect on attitude. However, positive recommendations from strong and weak ties for search and experience services are more influential than recommendations from no ties for credence services.

These profiles are then related to demographic characteristics through additional statistical analyses. In particular, the paper investigates and challenges the theoretical notion regarding the significance of gender and race/ethnicity in students' social network characteristics and social capital indicators.

The empirical analysis on the data of a wireless service provider shows that customers' WOM value is very comparable to their direct values. In addition, the WOM value is positively related to the customers' social capital and has an inverted U-shape link to the proportion of weak ties within the customers' social network.

Design/methodology/approach - This study developed a program and an online questionnaire to collect the data set from Facebook, and then integrated that data set with a subjective data set consisting of participants' opinions of the strength of their friendships on Facebook. The model developed here for predicting tie strength performed well when was applied on a data set of 6,477 SNSs' ties, distinguishing between strong and weak ties with over 50 percent accuracy. Findings - The results developed an algorithm (predictive model) that quantifies and measures tie strength continuously to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The results found that the variables in the dimension of emotional intensity had stronger effects than other interaction variables. Originality/value - This study developed a predictive model that helps explain the meaning of interaction on SNSs, providing an efficient method to examine tie strength on SNSs. The tie strength estimates can also be used to improve the range and performance of various aspects of SNSs, including link predictions, product recommendations, newsfeeds, people searches, and visualization. Such understanding of the structure of SNSs might lead ultimately to the design of algorithms that can detect trusted or influential users of SNSs.",2015"Marti, Joel; Cid, Jose","IMPRISONMENT, FAMILY TIES AND RECIDIVISM.

Our approach draws from theories developed in sociology, political science, and information science-we show that the social context of users influences their opinion about the credibility of messages they read, and that this context can be captured by analyzing the social network of users. We use this insight to improve recommendation algorithms for messages created in participatory media environments. Our methodology rests on Bayesian learning, integrating new concepts of context and completeness of messages inspired by the strength of weak ties hypothesis from social network theory. We show that our credibility evaluation model can be used to significantly enhance the performance of collaborative filtering recommendation. Experimental validation is done using datasets obtained from social networking websites used for knowledge sharing. We conclude by clarifying our relationship to the semantic adaptive social web, emphasizing our use of personal evaluations of messages and the social network of users, instead of merely automated semantic interpretation of content.",2015"Bian, Yanjie; Huang, Xianbi; Zhang, Lei",Information and favoritism: The network effect on wage income in China,SOCIAL NETWORKS,"How do social networks matter for labor market opportunities and outcomes? To fill in a gap between network theory and research evidence, we develop a theoretical explanation of how network-transmitted information and favoritism serve as causal mechanisms of wage income in China. In a large-scale Chinese survey, we find that 59% of the 4350 wage earners land on jobs through social contacts from whom the benefits of information and forms of favoritism are gained. Data analysis shows that (1) both weak ties and strong ties are used by Chinese job seekers to obtain information and favoritism to help secure job opportunities, but (2) weak ties are better able to channel job information than strong ties and strong ties are better able to mobilize forms of favoritism than weak ties, (3) information and favoritism equally promote job-worker matching, which in turn increases wage, and (4) favoritism has a stronger effect than does information on job assignment to positions of superior earning opportunity. This analysis demonstrates the non-spurious, causal effect of social networks on wage income in the Chinese context. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

First, the widely reported null relationship between informal job searching and wages is shown to be mostly the artifact of a coding error and sample selection restrictions. Second, previous analyses examined only active informal job searching without fully considering the benefits derived from unsolicited network assistance (the ""invisible hand of social capital"") - thereby underestimating the network effect. Third, wage returns to networks are examined across the earnings distribution. Longitudinal data from the NLSY reveal significant wage returns for network-based job finding over formal job searching, especially for individuals who were informally recruited into their jobs (non-searchers). Fixed effects quantile regression analyses show that contacts generate wage premiums among middle and high wage jobs, but not low wage jobs. These findings challenge conventional wisdom on contact effects and advance understanding of how social networks affect wage attainment and inequality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

When knowledge is complex and the knowledge seeker lacks intimacy with the knowledge source, knowledge sticks in its point of origin because the knowledge seeker faces ambiguity about the best way to acquire the needed knowledge. We theorize that, given the extent of that ambiguity, knowledge seekers will make a choice to either ask for needed knowledge immediately after deciding it is needed, or wait and ask for it at a later date. We hypothesize that when knowledge is sticky, knowledge seekers will delay asking for knowledge and, in the interim period, use an enterprise social networking site to gather information that can lubricate stuck knowledge, such as how, when, and in what way to ask for the desired knowledge. We propose that by doing this, knowledge seekers can increase their ultimate satisfaction with the knowledge once they ask for it. Data describing specific instances of knowledge transfer occurring in a large telecommunications firm supported these hypotheses, showing that knowledge transfer is made easier by the fact that enterprise social networking sites make other peoples' communications visible to casual observers such that knowledge seekers can gather information about the knowledge and its source simply by watching his or her actions through the technology, even if they never interacted with the source directly themselves. The findings show that simple awareness of others' communications (what we call ambient awareness) played a pivotal role in helping knowledge seekers to obtain interpersonal and knowledge-related material with which to lubricate their interactions with knowledge sources.",2015"Haimson, Oliver L.; Bowser, Anne E.; Melcer, Edward F.; Churchill, Elizabeth F.",Online Inspiration and Exploration for Identity Reinvention,CHI 2015: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 33RD ANNUAL CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS,"Self-representation online can be difficult for those who are in life transitions that involve exploring new identity facets and changes in personal style.

To understand the complex relationship between identity, personal style and online self-representation, we examine how people explore and experiment with new styles in public and in private online settings during gender transition. We present the results of interviews with transgender people who have recently reinvented their personal style, or are planning to do so in the near future. We find that people explore new styles in online settings to craft possible or ideal future selves. When involving others, people engage intimate and unknown others, but often avoid weak ties.

Design/methodology/approach - The research questions guiding the study are: How do organizational change elements influence knowledge sharing? and What are the critical elements of organizational change in relation to knowledge sharing? Based on Leavitt's (1965) organizational change model, 133 articles published between 2000 and 2012 from 13 journals were reviewed and analyzed. Findings - The total number of articles covering task, structure, technology and people in knowledge sharing was 49, 79, 49 and 97, respectively. Of all references, 97 articles (72 per cent) discussed the important aspects of people, and 79 articles (59 per cent) emphasized the influential role of organizational structure in knowledge sharing. The highest frequency of interactions (48 articles) was the interaction between structure and people (Interaction 5). Research limitations/implications - To capture broader phenomena on knowledge sharing in organizational change, multiple data sources and a variety of journals with a longer timeframe should be collected and a more comprehensive review should be conducted. All perspectives of organizational change were not applied to this study. Theoretically, this study attempted to illuminate how knowledge sharing has been explored through the lens of four elements in organizational change and the interactions between the elements. This study attempted to expand the use of Leavitt's (1965) model by applying interactive relationships among the elements to knowledge sharing. Practical implications - The findings can advance strategic and managerial practice by informing the planning and development of knowledge sharing associated with change in organizations. A key question is how to identify the major component of change which will trigger the other changes in the current architecture of knowledge sharing in their organizations. This study suggests that elements of structure and people, when organization face either planned or unplanned change, are critical for successful knowledge sharing by making the interactive connections with other components of change.

Different users play various roles on information diffusion: some are influential within a community and some make information widely spread across communities. This paper aims to unveil the hidden relationships between nodes and information diffusion in the context of communities from the big Twitter diffusion data with a million-scale social network, as a complement to existing link-based diffusion analysis (e.g. the strength of weak ties). We identify six types of well-known community-aware roles of nodes, and examine their diffusion capability on propagating information within/across communities, using information flows via retweet and mention in Twitter. We find nodes acting as community bridges are exposed to more information and more dominative on spread information within/across communities. Community-aware roles are also validated via supervised learning to be effective for detecting the most diffusive information propagators.",2015"Campbell, Scott W.","Mobile Communication and Network Privatism: A Literature Review of the Implications for Diverse, Weak, and New Ties",REVIEW OF COMMUNICATION RESEARCH,"Most of the research on the implications of mobile communication for social networks has focused on its uses and consequences in the intimate realm of close friends, family, and loved ones. A number of scholars have also become interested in ways that mobile communication helps and hinders the broader realm of network connectivity, including diverse, weak, and new ties. A collection of theoretical perspectives on mobile communication and diverse, weak, and new ties proposes that heightened connectivity in the intimate realm can come at the expense of being engaged more broadly - a scenario I characterize as network privatism. At the same time, the available empirical research in the literature tends to tell a different story, or rather stories. This analysis brings theory and empirical findings into closer conversation with one another by reviewing and synthesizing the literature in this area. Observed patterns in the literature offer new insight into questions of mobile communication and network privatism, while also pointing to opportunities for refinement of theory, analysis, and measurement as this line of inquiry further develops.",2015"de Oliveira, Adriana Lucinda; da Silva, Luiz Everson",THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF GRANOVETTER STUDIES FOR THE DEBATE ABOUT EMBEDDEDNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF EMPLOYABILITY OF GRADUATES IN HIGHER EDUCATION,REVISTA EDUCACAO E LINGUAGENS,"This article discusses the concept of ""embeddedness"" from a theoretical conception proposed by Mark Granovetter for analyzing the interference of strong and weak ties as well as networks in the professional integration into working life process of young people after completion of higher education.

It focuses on a strategic alliance's first new product development (NPD) project, which is characterized by a lack of prior experience and insufficient trust between partners and explores how the interaction between (1) interorganizational learning (the degree [amount of knowledge shared] and type [tacit or explicit nature of the knowledge]); (2) the required communication (frequency level and degree of media-richness) to transfer and exchange knowledge; and (3) economic transaction considerations (reducing cost and avoiding opportunism), in highly uncertain and dynamic environments, and, in the absence of an assumption of trust, will determine the future strength of the ties between partners. We argue that the degree and type of interorganizational learning that are required to efficiently develop an alliance's first NPD project determine the strength of the ties between the partners. Each degree and type of learning has a different impact on the frequency and media richness of the partners' communication, and consequently each leads to a different level of social tie strength between the partners. This relationship is moderated by the partners' market overlap. We suggest that the required degree and type of interorganizational learning is contingent on the project characteristics (degree of innovation; radical versus incremental, and the mode of development; modular versus integrated). This relationship, however, is moderated by the partners' technical skills (complementary versus similar).",2015"Huang, He; Yan, Zhijun; Pan, Yaohui",Measuring edge importance to improve immunization performance,PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS,"The edge heterogeneity has a remarkable influence on disease spreading, but it has seldom been considered in the disease-controlling policies.

However, the effect of geographic factors is still notable in light of the fact that most of the institutions in the largest subgroup are located in Europe. Examination of the network position, measured by degree centrality, indicates that homophily is more common than heterophily in the network. A relatively high number of relational ties are observed among institutions that have similar levels of network centrality. Mutual relations are prevalent among central institutions, while strong mutual solidarity exists between institutions on the periphery of the network. This study shows a general unstable international collaborative relationship among astronomical institutions. While more and more institutions have linked up in research collaboration, many of them keep relatively weak ties.

Returnee Entrepreneurs (REs) facilitate both direct technology transfer and indirect technology spillovers to local firms, thus contributing to the technological development of emerging economies. Much previous work is based on the integration of ethnic entrepreneurs in their host countries or business activities of transnational entrepreneurs that traverse their host and home countries. This study explores the role of social ties in venture creation by REs. Based on twenty case studies in India, the findings show that (1) local ties are indispensable for venture creation, and (2) the heterogeneity in the way REs leverage social ties across the host and home countries is contingent on the location of their intention to start up and generation of idea for their venture.

Therefore, many organizations invest in enterprise social media (ESM) to establish electronic networks of practice and to foster knowledge exchange among employees. ESM improves interaction transparency and can be regarded as a sociotechnical system that provides a language for communication and symbolic action as well as a better sense of others' social identity. Accordingly, the individual characteristics of knowledge seekers and contributors determine why and how interactions occur. However, existing studies tend to focus only on knowledge contributors' characteristics and to treat knowledge as an object that needs to be transferred. To address this gap, this study conceptualizes and empirically tests a multilevel model of knowledge exchange in electronic networks of practice (ENoP) that includes the characteristics of knowledge seekers and knowledge contributors as well as their dyadic relationship from an activity-centered language/action point of view. A dataset of 15,505 enterprise microblogging messages reveals that knowledge seekers' characteristics and relational factors drive knowledge exchanges in social media-enabled ENoP.

Using longitudinal data on 1385 developers and 190 publishers of video games in the global video game industry between 1972 and 2007, the analyses show that the effect of network ties between developers and publishers on the survival probability of developers is moderated by the level of technological turbulence in the industry. The results show that the effect of network partner failure on firm survival is dependent on the strength of ties. The failure of strongly tied network partners harms developers in stable periods and benefits them in turbulent eras, while no such relation is found for weakly tied network partners. Network partner diversity positively affects firm performance in epochs of technological turbulence, while the effect plays no significant role for firm survival in stable settings. The results indicate that the relation between interfirm network relations and firm survival are moderated by sequences of technological renewal in the video game industry which causes the industry to go through an evolution that deviates from the typical S-shaped trajectory found in industries that are characterized by strong path-dependent processes.

However, as interaction between individuals takes place in diverse contexts, these communities turn out to be overlapping. This implies that the society has a multilayered structure, where the layers represent the different contexts. To model this structure we begin with a single-layer weighted social network (WSN) model showing the Granovetterian structure. We find that when merging such WSN models, a sufficient amount of interlayer correlation is needed to maintain the relationship between topology and link weights, while these correlations destroy the enhancement in the community overlap due to multiple layers. To resolve this, we devise a geographic multilayer WSN model, where the indirect interlayer correlations due to the geographic constraints of individuals enhance the overlaps between the communities and, at the same time, the Granovetterian structure is preserved.",2014"Bahlmann, Marc D.",Geographic Network Diversity: How Does it Affect Exploratory Innovation?,INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION,"This study examines the underexplored effect of the geographic configuration of entrepreneurs' networks on their ventures' levels of exploratory innovation.

Our findings found partial support for the idea that actions are needed to actualize potential resources embedded in social networks, as centrally positioned managers enjoy higher innovativeness when they engage in ambassador activities.

In three studies, we analyze the influence of social sharing of consumption-related emotions on the sharer's satisfaction with the consumption experience and related outcomes. Study 1 demonstrates that the sharing of negative emotions amplifies the sharer's dissatisfaction. Study 2 shows that the specific nature of the negative emotion (anger vs. regret) and that of the recipient (friend vs. stranger) moderate this negative effect. Study 3 finds that the effects of sharing further depend on whether the recipient is viewed as a prospective customer or not. From a theoretical perspective, the findings contradict the claim that cathartic venting contributes to a person's relief and well-being. In addition, the assertion that strong ties are better than weak ties does not always hold. The benefits of sharing depend on the specific emotion involved and the recipient's interests. From a managerial perspective, the findings should help companies devise programs to compensate the negative consequences of service failures. For example, by offering customers the opportunity to express anger to strangers through their corporate websites or social media communities, managers may be able to reduce customer dissatisfaction and thus maintain the relationship. In addition, such opportunities may help the firm identify dissatisfied consumers and, in turn, apply service recovery strategies to retain them.",2014"Sharone, Ofer",Social Capital Activation and Job Searching: Embedding the Use of Weak Ties in the American Institutional Context,WORK AND OCCUPATIONS,"By comparing job seekers' use of weak ties in Israel and the United States, this article shows that Granovetter's canonical findings are rooted in the particular institutional context of the American white-collar labor market.

Past research points to the facilitating role of interpersonal relationships between policy-makers and researchers, imploring the adoption of a social network lens. This study aims to identify network-level factors associated with the exchange and use of research evidence in policymaking. Methods: Data on social networks and research use were collected from seventy policy actors across three health policy cases in Burkina Faso (child health, malaria, and HIV). Networks were graphed for actors' interactions, their provision of, and request for research evidence. Exponential random graph models estimated the probability of evidence provision and request between actors, controlling for network-and individual-level covariates. Logistic regression models estimated actors' use of research evidence to inform policy. Results: Network structure explained more than half of the evidence exchanges (ties) observed in these networks. Across all cases, a pair of actors was more likely to form a provision tie if they already had a request tie between them and visa versa (theta = 6.16, p < 0.05; theta = 2.87, p < 0.05;. = 2.31, p < 0.05). The child health network displayed clustering tendencies, meaning that actors were more likely to form ties if they shared an acquaintance (theta = 2.36, p < 0.05). Actors' use of research evidence was positively associated with their centrality (i.e., connectedness). Conclusions: The exchange and use of research evidence in policymaking can be partly explained by the structure of actors' networks of relationships.

No study thus far has included both these different kinds of contacts in a firm, let alone considered their combined effect. The exact overlap between formal as well as informal contacts between individuals, forming multiplex or what we call rich ties because of their contribution, especially drives the transfer of new, innovative knowledge in a firm. Studying two cases in very different settings suggests these rich ties have a particularly strong effect on knowledge transfer in an organization, even when controlling for the strength of ties.

The optimal networking for range involves a moderate level of structural foci networking and high levels of individually driven networking.

This pattern contrasts itself from many other types of networks where strong ties form communities while weak ties connect different communities.

This study incorporated the literatures on social networks and self-exempting beliefs to study the problem of daily smoking by exploring their mediatory relationships and the mechanisms of how smoking behavior is developed and maintained. Specifically, this article hypothesizes that social networks affect daily smoking directly as well as indirectly by facilitating the formation of self-exempting beliefs. The sample comes from urban male residents in Hangzhou, China randomly selected and interviewed through multistage sampling in 2011. Using binary mediation analysis with logistic regression to test the hypotheses, the authors found that (a) daily smoking is associated with having smokers in several social network arenas and (b) self-exempting beliefs about smoking mediate the association between coworker network and daily smoking, but not for family network and friend network. The role of social network at work place in the creation and maintenance of self-exempting beliefs should be considered by policymakers, prevention experts, and interventionists.",2014"Kim, Yong-Young; Kim, Mi-Hye; Oh, Sangjo",Emerging factors affecting the continuance of online gaming: the roles of bridging and bonding social factors,CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS,"The forecasted growth of the online gaming industry in Korea is expected to reach over 11.8 trillion Korean won (KRW) by 2014. Nearly 60 % of domestic residents play online games. Online games are becoming an integral part of life and we need different perspectives to look into this subject rather than focus on the negatives such as online gaming addiction. In addition, although achievement motivation for online games has been emphasized in earlier research, communicating and socializing with other players is commonplace in today's online gaming world and socialization motivation is emerging as an important factor influencing online gamers. With stress on the communication and socialization aspects of online gaming, we need different perspectives from those of the past to investigate online gaming and draw on social capital theory. By socially interacting with other gamers, the online gamer not only builds new relationships (bridging social capital), but he/she also strengthens existing relationships (bonding social capital). However, previous research has concentrated only on one of these types of user interactions, and has not analyzed interactions for both bridging and bonding social capital at the same time. Therefore, this study explores both bridging and bonding social capital in online gaming with a neutral dependent construct, the continuance of online gaming, and provides new insights and implications for future research and the industry.",2014"Thuo, Mary; Bell, Alexandra A.; Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.; Lachaud, Michee A.; Okello, David K.; Okoko, Evelyn Nasambu; Kidula, Nelson L.; Deom, Carl M.; Puppala, Naveen",Effects of social network factors on information acquisition and adoption of improved groundnut varieties: the case of Uganda and Kenya,AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES,"Social networks play a significant role in learning and thus in farmers' adoption of new agricultural technologies. This study examined the effects of social network factors on information acquisition and adoption of new seed varieties among groundnut farmers in Uganda and Kenya. The data were generated through face-to-face interviews from a random sample of 461 farmers, 232 in Uganda and 229 in Kenya. To assess these effects two alternative econometric models were used: a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit (SUBP) model and a recursive bivariate probit (RBP) model. The statistical evaluation of the SUBP shows that information acquisition and adoption decisions are interrelated while tests for the RBP do not support this latter model. Therefore, the analysis is based on the results obtained from the SUBP. These results reveal that social network factors, particularly weak ties with external support (e.g., researchers, extension agents, etc.), partially influence information acquisition, but do not influence adoption. In Uganda, external support, gender, farm size, and geographic location have an impact on information acquisition. In Kenya, external support and geographic location also have an impact on information acquisition. With regard to adoption, gender, household size, and geographic location play the most important roles for Ugandan farmers, while in Kenya information from external sources, education, and farm size affect adoption choice. The study provides insight on the importance of external weak ties in groundnut farming, and a need to understand regional differences along gender lines while developing agricultural strategies. This study further illustrates the importance of farmer participation in applied technology research and the impact of social interactions among farmers and external agents.",2014"Sagor, Eli S.; Becker, Dennis R.",The Effect of Data Collection Technique on Estimated Landowner Personal Network Attributes,SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY,"Social network analysis, focusing on the role of interpersonal relationships on the flow of information, trust, and service delivery, is increasingly recognized as a valuable approach to understanding landowner behavior. Landowner personal networks are central to Diffusion of Innovations theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior, both of which are commonly invoked in the design of interventions to encourage sustainable private forest management. However, personal network data can be difficult to obtain for a large sample. We tested the effect of three different personal network name generators on estimates of Minnesota landowners' forestry information networks: a list of generic alter categories, an open-ended written survey, and a combination of written survey and follow-up telephone survey. Generic network data provided a relatively accurate baseline. Personal network data from a written survey provided more detailed data but underestimated network diversity and failed to account for potentially influential weak ties. A combination of written and follow-up telephone survey both doubled estimated average network size from 2.8 to 5.5 alters and increased estimated network diversity from 2.3 alter categories per respondent to 3.7. Network data from the written survey revealed a bias in favor of strong ties that was largely overcome through additional prompting during the telephone survey.

Organizational networking refers to firm behaviors, i.e. the activities/routines/practices, which enable an organization to make sense of and capitalize on their networks of direct and indirect business relationships. We conceptualize the measurement model as a second-order formative construct with four first-order reflective constructs based on a four-dimensional view of organizational networking comprising information acquisition, opportunity enabling, strong-tie resource mobilization and weak-tie resource mobilization. The scale validation was undertaken at the first- and second-order levels. The result confirms the four distinct first-order measurement models. At the second-order level, a MIMIC (multiple indicators and multiple causes) model was employed to assess the validity of the formative measurement model. The results suggest that all four components significantly contribute to the overarching construct of organizational networking, with strong-tie resource mobilization being the most important contributor. Thus, our operationalization confirms the uniqueness of the different dimensions of organizational networking that should be configured as a strategy of sensing and seizing opportunities in the network. The organizational networking scale will provide future research with a basis to explore different strategic patterns of networking behaviors in varying contexts, and its role in relation to other organizational behaviors and outcome variables, such as firm performance.

I suggest that some content is more beneficial than others and that tie strength may affect creativity for reasons other than the associated structure. That is, tie strength may affect how individuals process nonredundant knowledge. I investigate 2 types of knowledge content-information (i.e., facts or data) and frames (i.e., interpretations or impressions) and explore whether tie strength influences their effect on creativity. Drawing on creativity theory, I employ an experimental design to provide greater theoretical clarity and to isolate causality. According to the results from 2 studies, distinct frames received from contacts facilitate creativity, but the effect of distinct information is more complex. When individuals receive distinct information from strong ties, it constrains creativity compared to distinct frames. Content from weak ties appears to facilitate creativity across all scenarios. The results of mediated moderation analysis indicate the effect of framing versus information for strong ties is driven by decision-making time, as an indicator of cognitive expansion.",2014"Venkataramani, Vijaya; Richter, Andreas W.; Clarke, Ronald",Creative Benefits From Well-Connected Leaders: Leader Social Network Ties as Facilitators of Employee Radical Creativity,JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY,"Employee radical creativity critically depends on substantive informational resources from others across the wider organization.

Drawing on data from 214 employees working in 30 teams of a public technology and environmental services organization, we find that team leaders' betweenness centrality in the idea network within their teams as well as among their peer leaders provides creative benefits beyond employees' own internal and external ties. Further, employees' and leaders' ties within and external to the team interactively predict employee radical creativity.

In this paper, I posit that organizations have a social structural response. I argue that in an attempt to avoid problems related to candidates' job search, organizations are more likely to provide job offers to candidates with friends in the hiring organization than to those without friends. I test and find support for this hypothesis in a study of entry-level professionals in business and law. After a period of trial employment, candidates were more likely to receive job offers from organizations if they had a friend employed there than if they did not.

Kevin; Phelps, Corey",Divisive Faultlines and the Unplanned Dissolutions of Multipartner Alliances,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,"Received wisdom suggests that multipartner alliances are relatively unstable because of their complexity and the increased potential for free riding. Nonetheless, multipartner alliances do benefit from built-in stabilizing third-party ties that mitigate opportunism and conflict between partner pairs. Previous empirical research on multipartner alliance stability has been inconclusive. We shed some light on these inconsistencies by recognizing that within multipartner alliances, schisms can occur not only between a pair of partners but also between subgroups of partners that are divided by faultlines. We suggest that divisive faultlines can form between subgroups of partners within a multipartner alliance as a function of their prior experience with one another. When a subgroup of alliance partners has relatively strong ties to each other and weak ties to other partners, destabilizing factions can develop that hamper reciprocity among the partners. Using a longitudinal analysis of 59 multipartner alliances, we found that, in general, faultlines (as modeled by the dispersion of tie strength within multipartner alliances) increase the hazard of unplanned dissolutions. We also found that multipartner alliances comprising a mix of centrally and peripherally positioned partners within the industry network were less apt to suffer the effects of divisive faultlines. We suggest that this is due to the greater opportunity costs of dissolution and the presence of relatively high-status partners who can act as peacekeepers and coordinators of their lower-status partners.",2014"Perry-Smith, Jill E.; Shalley, Christina E.",A Social Composition View of Team Creativity: The Role of Member Nationality-Heterogeneous Ties Outside of the Team,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,"We sought to understand team member informal social network ties outside of the team as a way to achieve cognitive variation within the team, thereby facilitating creativity.

This paper focuses mainly on research methods for visualizing informal networked learning for teachers. Drawing upon Social Network Theory and Analysis and such notions as Social Capital, Networked Learning, and Communities of Practice we create a theoretical model to underpin the design of our web 2.0, Network Awareness Tool NAT. NAT address several problems connected with informal networked learning research in organizations, such as the informal learning paradox. Advanced Search and Signalling Features can overcome the problem of under-representation of the data. Authorship minimises the problem of unrealistic representation of data. Making use of user profiles and allowing them to (re)enter and improve data on both online and off-line (and combinations thereof) networked activities offers an alternative approach to the name/resource generating (Van der Gaag & Snijders, 2005) and position generating strategies (Lin, Fu, & Hsung, 2001) often used for collecting social network data. The implementation of a profile page, tags and ratings provides the opportunity to triangulate data on the needed multidimensional level, representing informal learning in the dimensions covered by the theoretical model. NAT could impact on our current understanding of informal networked learning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To do this, we consider the three dimensions of social capital: the structural dimension, as measured by the position of firms bridging structural holes; the relational dimension, as gauged by the level of trust and friendship in each relationship; and the cognitive dimension, as estimated by the presence of a shared culture. We also evaluate the level of organizational and human capital present in terms of the firms in the network. Empirical evidence has been gathered from the Madrid Science Park in Spain by applying the social network analysis methodology.

However, the mechanisms (processes, activities) taking place within social networks are insufficiently understood. The aim of this review was to focus on identifying the mechanisms linking social networks with CIM. Here we consider network mechanisms as located within a broader social context that shapes practices, behaviours, and the multiplicity of functions and roles that network members fulfil. Methods: A systematic search of qualitative studies was undertaken on Medline, Embase, and Web for papers published between 1st January 2002 and 1st December 2013. Eligible for inclusion were studies dealing with diabetes, and with conditions or health behaviours relevant for diabetes management; and studies exploring the relationship between social networks, self-management, and deprivation. 25 papers met the inclusion criteria. A qualitative metasynthesis was undertaken and the review followed a line of argument synthesis. Results: The main themes identified were: 1) sharing knowledge and experiences in a personal community; 2) accessing and mediation of resources; 3) self-management support requires awareness of and ability to deal with network relationships. These translated into line of argument synthesis in which three network mechanisms were identified. These were network navigation (identifying and connecting with relevant existing resources in a network), negotiation within networks (re-shaping relationships, roles, expectations, means of engagement and communication between network members), and collective efficacy (developing a shared perception and capacity to successfully perform behaviour through shared effort, beliefs, influence, perseverance, and objectives). These network mechanisms bring to the fore the close interdependence between social and psychological processes in CIM, and the intertwining of practical and moral dilemmas in identifying, offering, accepting, and rejecting support. Conclusions: CIM policy and interventions could be extended towards: raising awareness about the structure and organisation of personal communities; building individual and network capacity for navigating and negotiating relationships and CIM environments; maximising the possibilities for social engagement as a way of increasing the effectiveness of individual and network efforts for CIM.",2014"Ivancic, Angela; Podmenik, Darka; Hafner, Ana","Independent inventors, social capital, and knowledge transfer - the case of Slovenia",INNOVATION-THE EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,"This paper explores the role and significance of independent inventors within the national innovation system.

In Study 1, students experienced greater happiness and greater feelings of belonging on days when they interacted with more classmates than usual. Broadening the scope in Studies 2A and 2B to include all daily interactions (with both strong and weak ties), we again found that weak ties are related to social and emotional well-being.

In order to examine its influence on decision-making, an individual's memory-based decision-making system is developed, and then, we integrate the multi-agent decision systems and construct a sequential risky decision model on the basis of an informational cascade. This study aims at exploring the public's decisions on whether or not to take protective actions under risk. The findings indicate that people with different strength of ties to friends and relatives make huge differences on decision-making. In the group with weak ties, the agent's total size of decision information and the level of risk perception are reducing in the sequential decision process. We further prove that people with weak ties are more prone to take no protective action, and the probability is also decreasing with the decision turn. The sequence of people with strong ties makes decisions dynamically with the intensity of released information. Finally, the influences of forgetting rate and memory capacity on people's decision-making are examined. The model provides a new line of thought about building a multi-agent system of DMP, which is also very helpful for the design of an information management system during emergencies.

However, much of this research is based on standardized summative assessments, which, while important, may have limited applicability to timely instructional decision making. As such, in this work, we examine the relationship between teacher social interaction and interim benchmark formative assessments, which have been argued to play a more useful role in instructional decision making. Purpose: In this study we used a human and social capital framework to explore the relationship between teacher social interaction and student achievement on an interim benchmark formative assessment. We hypothesized that teacher social capital would be positively related with student achievement as measured by an interim assessment, even after controlling for student and teacher demographics as well as proxies for teacher human capital. Population: A sample of 63 teachers from five elementary schools in a midsize U.S. district completed a demographic and social network survey, from which we generated our human and social capital measures. For student-level data, we collected current and prior student achievement from 1,196 third to fifth grade students on an English Language Arts Interim Benchmark Assessment. Research Design: We used survey data to conduct social network analysis and hierarchical linear modeling to explore the multilevel relationship between human and social capital and student achievement. Results: Results indicated that even when controlling for student demographics and prior achievement, teachers' human and social capital had a significant effect on student achievement as measured by interim assessments. More specifically our results indicated that more teaching experience in the current school was associated with better student performance on the interim assessment. In addition, the act of reaching out to other teachers to share knowledge regarding reading comprehension was associated with higher student scores on the interim assessment even when controlling for demographics and past academic performance. Conclusions: This study offers a unique insight into the role of accessing capital resources and student achievement in strengthening schools under increased pressure to improve. Our work adds to the growing empirical base that suggests that teacher social interaction has a relationship with student achievement. To encourage social interaction, creating formal policies and structures for teachers to develop social ties with one another related to content may be a useful strategy in supporting student outcomes.",2014"Harris, Jenine K.; Roche, Jason; Estlund, Amy K.; Mense, Cindy; Baker, Elizabeth A.",Partnering to Create a More Livable City: The Livable St Louis Network,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE,"Context: Physical inactivity is a major public health problem. While individual (eg, attitudes, values, beliefs) and social (eg, social support) factors play a role, access to an activity-safe local environment can have a significant influence. Environments that include accessible opportunities for physical activity, a component of livability, require cooperation from many sectors including nonprofit, government, educational, and for profit. Objective/Design/Setting: This study used a mixed-methods network mapping approach to evaluate a multisector network focused on increasing the livability of St Louis, Missouri. Participants: Eighteen network members participated in in-depth interviews about their livability partners. Outcome Measures/Results: The participants identified 86 unique partners in the region, with a majority representing nonprofit and government organizations and fewer from the education and for-profit sectors. Participants trusted 88% of their partners and felt that 83% of partners shared their mission and vision. Trust and shared mission and vision varied across organization types. Specifically, 89% of nonprofit partners were thought to share a mission/vision and 87% were trusted. Participants felt that 87% of government partners shared their mission/vision and 91% were trusted. Participants shared mission/vision with 75% and trusted 75% of educational partners. Finally, 44% of for-profit partners were thought to share mission/vision and 100% were trusted. For-profit partners also had more positive influence than others, while government partners had the highest average negative influence. Finally, while most relationships were mutual, relationships with for-profit partners were mostly one-directional, with for-profit partners sending resources to other network members.

Through the web interface with the given methods, stakeholders can reflect upon their individual experiences to achieve desirable planning outcomes through asynchronous, distributed collaboration with the public. Based on the qualitative and quantitative content and survey data set, this study examined the identification of spatial models that could implement different perceptions and promote the sharing of knowledge about integrating buildings into a rural landscape, the certification of the possible impact on tourism and the refining of the interface's usability. To strengthen data interpretation, these hypotheses were analysed by four different clusters of people with the aid of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and principal component analysis (PCA) tests: weak ties, socially linked, roots and resources, and dedicated to the place, based on social and emotional terms. In general, most participants gave a positive response to the questions and an interesting fact amongst the findings was the difference between roots and resources (positive to building integrations) and dedicated to the place (negative to building integrations). Thus, the analysed results demonstrated that the web interface could achieve a consensus on recommendations for the spatial planning with the implementation of decision alternatives and understanding of the other interest groups' preferences.

Both networks of strong ties explain more of the variance than other factors, such as measured or self-evaluated technical competencies, or the personalities of the team members.

Thus far, family systems have been primarily addressed on a macro regional level with indirect measures. Revisiting Reher (1998) and the family ties criterion, the main question of this paper is to examine to what extent we perceive family structures differently in Europe by taking direct measures of the structures of people's broader social networks into consideration. Based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we derived two indicators of family regimes based on individual-level data regarding the density of ego social networks: contact frequency and geographic proximity among network members. We aggregated these data and mapped them on the NUTS 2 level regions for various locations in Europe. The results of our analyses exhibit that, based on these two network indicators, significant differences in family structures between European regions exist. These results confirm the classification of strong family Southern and comparatively weaker family Northern European regions to a large extent, though substantial regional differences in and between countries are also revealed. Our findings demonstrate that the classification of European regions largely depends on which indicator of network density we consider. This is particularly obvious in the Eastern European regions where the classification markedly differs according to the type of network indicator. Intriguingly, social networks in Central European regions can be characterized as rather loose, often even looser than the 'traditional' weak ties in Scandinavia. Family regimes can, therefore, be regarded as a construct of multiple dimensions of which one dimension may be classified as weak while the other can be strong at the same time.",2014"Schoenherr, Tobias; Griffith, David A.; Chandra, Aruna",Knowledge Management in Supply Chains: The Role of Explicit and Tacit Knowledge,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS LOGISTICS,"We theorize, building on the knowledge-based view and the theoretical distinction between explicit and tacit knowledge, that knowledge management capability across the supply chain manifests itself in explicit and tacit knowledge, which in turn effectuates supply chain performance. The model is tested with survey data from 195 small- and medium-sized enterprises reporting on their primary supply chain. The results indicate that the supply chain's knowledge management capability manifests itself in both explicit and tacit knowledge, with the latter being influenced more strongly. Moreover, it was found that while both explicit and tacit knowledge influence supply chain performance, the latter exerts a significantly greater impact than the former. Exploratory post hoc analyses add robustness to these findings and investigate mechanisms inherent to the transformation of tacit into explicit knowledge.

However, the activation of these weak ties is highly dependent upon perceptions of future reciprocity from newcomers to the community by the entrenched members. Weak ties are important because they serve as a foundation for community members engaging in collective problem solving. Civic and social institutions can mediate the negative effects of rapid community growth shown. When newcomers are not integrated into the community, it may lead to exploitation and exclusion due to stigmatic labels. (C) 2013 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

I posit that more basic relationships that have been established through manufacturing integration can enable multicountry collaborative innovations and that these innovations will bring together diverse knowledge that is likely to spawn further innovation within firms. Empirical analysis of a panel that includes comprehensive and confidential data on the worldwide operations of U.S. MNCs and their worldwide patents reveals robust support for these arguments. Overall, this paper broadens extant research on knowledge generation within MNCs by exploring both the antecedents and benefits of multicountry collaborative innovations.

The results of path regression model shows that using SNS to meet new people is positively correlated with bonding and bridging social capital in the virtual world, using SNS to contact existing friends contributes to both bonding and bridging social capital in the real world. Online bonding and bridging social capital are positively related to online civic involvement, but not significantly related to offline civic behaviors. Offline bonding and bridging social capital are positively associated with offline civic participation, but not significantly related to online civic participation. The direct effect of using SNS to meet new social ties on civic engagement is partially mediated by social capital, whilst the effect of using SNS to connect friends on civic participation is completely mediated by social capital.

However, in many countries a landscape-level conversion is uneven at best and stalled at worst. This is particularly true across the eastern rural landscape in the United States. We explore the role of social networks as drivers of system transformation within dairy production in the eastern United States, specifically rotational grazing as an alternative management option. We hypothesize the importance of weak ties within farmer social networks as drivers of change. In Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and New York, we conducted 53 interviews with confinement, low-intensity, and rotational grazing dairy producers as well as 35 interviews with associated network actors. Though confinement and grazier networks had similar proportions of strong and weak ties, confinement producers had more market-based weak ties, while graziers had more weak-ties to government agencies and other graziers in the region. These agency weak ties supported rotational graziers through information exchange and cost sharing, both crucial to farmers' transitions from confinement-based production to grazing systems. While weak ties were integral to initial innovation, farmers did not maintain these relationships beyond their transition to grazing. Of equal importance, grazier weak-tie networks did not include environmental organizations, suggesting unrealized potential for more diverse networks based on environmental services. By understanding the drivers, we can identify barriers to expanding weak tie networks and emergent properties in order to create institutions and policies necessary for change.",2014"Park, Namgyoo K.; Mezias, John M.; Lee, Jinju; Han, Jae-Hoon",Reverse knowledge diffusion: Competitive dynamics and the knowledge seeking behavior of Korean high-tech firms,ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT,"This paper endeavors to enrich the existing knowledge acquisition literatures by specifically highlighting downsides of external ties of individuals.

Flows thus gain prominence in comparison to places like regions and neighbourhoods. At the same time, however, neighbourhoods continue to play a role in the actions and imaginations of people, neighbourhood organizations, and government policies. People still live in neighbourhoods, and governments still try to solve often severe social problems through neighbourhood policies.

From a general assimilation perspective, however, it has been questioned whether they are really the right sort of ties to help immigrants succeed in the host society, or whether, instead, they constitute some sort of mobility trap. Empirical evidence from available studies is mixed, and a reference to more general social capital theory suggests that the effect might be contingent on the institutional context of the receiving country, the specific immigrant groups involved, and the particular types of jobs. In this paper, we study the impact of migrant networks on the labor market integration of recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union to Germany. This turns out to be a strategic test case, for both theoretical and methodological reasons. Relying on longitudinal data and using discrete event history models, we show that the findings are different for two distinguishable groups involved, Ethnic Germans and Jewish Quota Refugees, and that whether the effects are positive or negative further depends on whether or not these groups seek entry to higher-status jobs in the professional, managerial, or technical occupations.",2014"Long, Janet C.; Cunningham, Frances C.; Carswell, Peter; Braithwaite, Jeffrey",Patterns of collaboration in complex networks: the example of a translational research network,BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,"Background: This paper examines collaboration in a complex translational cancer research network (TRN) made up of a range of hospital-based clinicians and university-based researchers. We examine the phenomenon of close-knit and often introspective clusters of people (silos) and test the extent that factors associated with this clustering (geography, profession and past experience) influence patterns of current and future collaboration on TRN projects. Understanding more of these patterns, especially the gaps or barriers between members, will help network leaders to manage subgroups and promote connectivity crucial to efficient network function. Methods: An on-line, whole network survey was used to collect attribute and relationship data from all members of the new TRN based in New South Wales, Australia in early 2012. The 68 members were drawn from six separate hospital and university campuses. Social network analysis with UCInet tested the effects of geographic proximity, profession, past research experience, strength of ties and previous collaborations on past, present and future intended partnering. Results: Geographic proximity and past working relationships both had significant effects on the choice of current collaboration partners. Future intended collaborations included a significant number of weak ties and ties based on other members' reputations implying that the TRN has provided new opportunities for partnership. Professional grouping, a significant barrier discussed in the translational research literature, influenced past collaborations but not current or future collaborations, possibly through the mediation of network brokers. Conclusions: Since geographic proximity is important in the choice of collaborators a dispersed network such as this could consider enhancing cross site interactions by improving virtual communication technology and use, increasing social interactions apart from project related work, and maximising opportunities to meet members from other sites. Key network players have an important brokerage role facilitating linkages between groups.",2014"Ghose, Rina; Pettygrove, Margaret",Actors and networks in urban community garden development,GEOFORUM,"Community gardens play a significant role in challenging neoliberal inequities by serving as spaces of alternative food production and community development activities in marginalized neighborhoods. While past research has explored the production of place in community gardens, less attention is paid to the role of social networks in garden development. Yet, network formation is critical for grassroots groups to navigate neoliberal governance and politics of power. This article draws on social network theories to examine the process of urban community garden development set within the context of neoliberalization. These theories provide a useful framework for evaluating networking as a spatial strategy and conceptualizing power relations within networks. We contend that forming spaces of engagement through scaled networks constituted by strong and weak ties is an essential means by which actors obtain information and leverage resources necessary to build and maintain urban community gardens. However, we also find that these networks contain power hierarchies that shape the conditions for participation in the networks. Actors with fewer resources and lesser political clout are compelled to conform to the interests of powerful actors. In employing social network theories to analyze urban community garden formation, this paper aims to achieve greater theorization and understanding of the complexities embedded in community garden development.

In particular, I examine the use of two key types of ICTs - knowledge repositories and online discussion forums. Based on the perceived cost of using these two types of ICTs, I theorize about how various factors would differ in their influence on knowledge sourcing from knowledge repositories and from online discussion forums. Two event-driven surveys were conducted with members of a CoP in a consulting firm to test the hypotheses. The surveys were conducted when CoP members downloaded documents from the knowledge repository and when CoP members posted inquiries and received responses in an online discussion forum.

However, for external knowledge to be recombined into innovation, the knowledge must first be recognized as potentially valuable. Going beyond traditional structural explanations, we predict that the use of diverse knowledge to generate creative ideas and solutions will depend in part on employees' psychological attachment to the organizational groups to which they belong, i.e., their social identity, and the strength of their social ties. We test our hypotheses in an R&D division of a global high-technology firm, finding that social identity influences the creative generativity of boundary-spanning ties. Specifically, stronger team identity renders interactions with colleagues on other work teams less generative of creative ideas, while identification with an overarching, superordinate group (e.g., a division) enhances creative generativity.

The Strength of Collaboration Ties,ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE,"Weak ties, a valuable aid in getting a job, are generally work ties. One reason for this feature is not that former colleagues increase one's information but rather that they value the pursuit of past collaboration. We examine the consequence of the collaboration ties hypothesis in the financial industry labor market. In finance, the labor market values the assets that financial operatives take with them from one firm to another, such as knowledge, know-how and customers. Since assets are to a certain extent shared among co-workers, it is worth hiring business relations and former colleagues or moving in teams: this enables a better transfer of assets such as idiosyncratic work routines, distributed knowledge, or joint customers. To demonstrate our claims we rely on an online survey launched with eFinancialCareers.fr collected in September 2008 among French financial employees. This questionnaire shows that working at the core of financial markets favors the accumulation of key moveable assets on the one hand and of collaboration ties on the other. That is, collaboration ties and key moveable assets are strongly correlated. The moving of key assets, collaboration ties and notably the combination of those two dimensions all result in increased wages.",2014"Eklinder-Frick, Jens; Eriksson, Lars Torsten; Hallen, Lars",Multidimensional social capital as a boost or a bar to innovativeness,INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT,"Innovation does not only demand new ideas, financial resources and knowledge of supplier and user systems, but is also influenced by social capital which has an impact on the innovativeness in business networks.

Three dimensions of social capital are applied in a case study of a regional strategic network - the socio-economic, the structural and the actor-oriented dimensions - while focusing on the last one. Data were collected at two points in time, at the start of the regional strategic network in 2004 and at the end of the project in 2010.

However, past efforts to bridge schools, families, and communities have been undermined by mistrust between and among stakeholders. Although trust is a building block for effective collaboration, there is little deliberate attention to cultivating it. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to use a case example of a low-income neighborhood currently developing a Promise Neighborhoods initiative to explore how variations in trust between and among community residents, local institutions, and school staff in the problem definition and assessment phase may threaten or facilitate the success of the initiative. Setting: We conducted this study in a low-income, predominantly African-American neighborhood in a midsize southeastern city. Participants: There were 44 participants, including parents, school administrators and staff, service providers, and high school students. Research Design: We used qualitative research methods, including eight focus groups and observations. Data Collection and Analysis: Focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Multiple researchers coded the transcripts. Trust emerged as a key theme through open coding, and we used focused coding to explore this theme in detail. Findings: The findings corroborate previous studies that have found relatively low levels of relational trust between residents, between residents and local institutions, and between residents and school staff. Additionally, we identified ""seeds of trust"" that indicate opportunities to cultivate trusting relationships between stakeholders that can be developed and replicated in this neighborhood and others undertaking similar initiatives.

Using a teacher-student lens, this study examines the combined impact of specific structural mechanisms and motivational processes by MNC parents on the ability of 216 subsidiaries to absorb parent-initiated marketing strategies. The findings reveal that MNC parents can indeed cultivate subsidiaries' ability to appropriate marketing knowledge through a combination of adopting specific social structures and investing in particular efforts. However, the effect of social structure on subsidiary absorptive capacity is indirect, and accounted for by the parents' intensity of effort. A number of theoretical implications emerge from the findings for research on absorptive capacity in relation to the role of the knowledge source, the need to examine organizational influences in relation to one another, and validating the original absorptive capacity dimensions.

In this context, knowledge and knowledge transfer are considered an important source of innovation and competitive advantage. Social capital theory offers a theoretical approach to explain how individuals, groups, and organizations manage relationships and access knowledge resources. The structural dimension of social capital has stimulated debate regarding optimal network configuration to achieve innovation. The extant literature suggests network structures evolve from a bridging configuration to a bonding configuration without examining the details of how the evolution occurs within the network and its stage-by-stage impact on knowledge transfer. This study explores this relationship by analyzing the evolution of a successful Irish pharmaceutical network involving organizations from industry and academia. This research setting encompasses a rare network configuration in an industry known for its lack of collaboration among competing firms., Findings show that structural holes provide access to a set of complementary and heterogeneous knowledge. However, for such knowledge to be exploited, the network configuration has to evolve from a sparse network (small in size and characterized by weak ties across multiple organizational networks), to a large and cohesive network configuration characterized by high levels of commitment, trust, fine-grained information exchange, and joint problem solving. Mechanisms crucial to this evolution include consistently-scheduled meetings, training to communicate tacit knowledge, wide diffusion of knowledge through an on online portal, and relationship specific investments designed to safeguard intellectual property. Surprisingly, industry members appear to transition to a cohesive network faster than do academic members. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, conflicting evidence exists regarding their role in the acquisition of specific knowledge. This study proposes that relational ties have a nonlinear effect on specific knowledge acquisition and that this nonlinear relationship is conditional on contract specificity and competitive intensity. Results from a sample of 385 manufacturer-supplier exchanges in China demonstrate that a buyer's relational ties with its major supplier have an inverted U-shaped effect on specific knowledge acquisition from this supplier; this inverted U-shaped relationship is stronger (steeper) when contract specificity is high and competition is more intense.

Results: The results provide an articulation of how SNMs are substantially involved in weak tie illness management. Weaker ties constituted 16.1% of network membership involved in illness work. The amount of work undertaken was similar but less than that of stronger ties. Weaker ties appeared more durable and less liable to loss over time than stronger ties. The qualitative accounts suggested that weak ties enabled the moral positioning of the self-managing 'self' and acted on the basis of a strong sense of reciprocity. Conclusions: Weak ties act as an acceptable bridge between a sense of personal agency and control and the need for external support because it is possible to construct a sense of moral acceptability through reciprocal exchange. Access to weak tie resources needs to be taken into account when considering the ways in which systems of health implementation for chronic illness are designed and delivered.",2014"Karsai, Marton; Perra, Nicola; Vespignani, Alessandro",Time varying networks and the weakness of strong ties,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"In most social and information systems the activity of agents generates rapidly evolving time-varying networks. The temporal variation in networks' connectivity patterns and the ongoing dynamic processes are usually coupled in ways that still challenge our mathematical or computational modelling. Here we analyse a mobile call dataset and find a simple statistical law that characterize the temporal evolution of users' egocentric networks. We encode this observation in a reinforcement process defining a time-varying network model that exhibits the emergence of strong and weak ties. We study the effect of time-varying and heterogeneous interactions on the classic rumour spreading model in both synthetic, and real-world networks. We observe that strong ties severely inhibit information diffusion by confining the spreading process among agents with recurrent communication patterns. This provides the counterintuitive evidence that strong ties may have a negative role in the spreading of information across networks.",2014"Shwed, Uri; Kalev, Alexandra",Are Referrals More Productive or More Likeable? Social Networks and the Evaluation of Merit,AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST,"Scholars and practitioners agree that referrals provide firms with better workers. Economists and sociologists debate whether the underlying mechanism behind such relations is a better match between workers and firms or an advantage conferred by social relations. Building on insights from network theory and cognitive psychology, we offer a new approach to the debate, arguing that network relations can also create evaluative bias. We reexamine the connection between social ties and workers' performance using unique data on the actual productivity of sales employees and their evaluations in a large global firm. Results suggest that the preexistence of ties between an incoming employee and insiders in the firm creates an evaluative advantage-an advantage that is unrelated to workers' concrete performance. We discuss the implications of these results for a relational approach to social stratification, organizations and work, as well as social networks.",2014"Jiang, Wenjun; Wang, Guojun; Wu, Jie",Generating trusted graphs for trust evaluation in online social networks,FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE,"We propose a novel trust framework to address the issue of ""Can Alice trust Bob on a service?"" in large online social networks (OSNs). Many models have been proposed for constructing and calculating trust. However, two common shortcomings make them less practical, especially in large OSNs: the information used to construct trust is (1) usually too complicated to get or maintain, that is, it is resource consuming; and (2) usually subjective and changeable, which makes it vulnerable to vicious nodes. With those problems in mind, we focus on generating small trusted graphs for large OSNs, which can be used to make previous trust evaluation algorithms more efficient and practical. We show how to preprocess a social network (PSN) by developing a simple and practical user-domain-based trusted acquaintance chain discovery algorithm through using the small-world network characteristics of online social networks and taking advantage of ""weak ties"". Then, we present how to build a trust network (BTN) and generate a trusted graph (GTG) with the adjustable width breadth-first search algorithms. To validate the effectiveness of our work and to evaluate the quality of the generated trusted graph, we conduct many experiments with the real data set from Epinions.com. Our work is the first that focuses on generating small trusted graphs for large online social networks, and we explore the stable and objective information (such as domain) for inferring trust.

A simulation model that includes network characteristics and network participant's characteristics is run using parameter sweeping, yielding 1450 simulation cases. The notion of coalitions was used to denote partnerships in networked innovation. Coalitions compete against each other and several variables were observed for winning coalitions. Close analysis of the variations and their influence on the average power per winning coalition was analysed using stepwise multiple regression analysis. The analysis brought forward two main conclusions. First, as average betweenness centrality per winning coalition increases, the average power per winning coalition decreases. This implies that having high betweenness centrality as a network participant makes it easier to build a successful coalition, as a coalition needs lower average power to succeed. Second, as the number of network participants increases, the average power per winning coalition decreases. This implies that in a larger network, it may be easier to form a successful coalition. The results form the basis for the development of a utility-based recommendation system that helps people choose optimal partners in an innovation network.",2014"Houshmand, Marjan; Seidel, Marc-David L.; Ma, Dennis G.","BENEFICIAL ""CHILD LABOR"": THE IMPACT OF ADOLESCENT WORK ON FUTURE PROFESSIONAL OUTCOMES",ADOLESCENT EXPERIENCES AND ADULT WORK OUTCOMES: CONNECTIONS AND CAUSES,"Purpose - Theories of income inequality frequently cite child and adolescent labor as a societal problem. In contrast to such theories, we propose that path dependency coupled with enhancement of human and social capital enables some adolescents who work to find more attractive jobs later in life. Methodology - Using the longitudinal Youth in Transition Survey (YITS) spanning over 10 years, we find support for a positive relationship between adolescents' number of work hours and future desirable professional outcomes such as being employed, income, person-organization fit, knowing where to look for a job, and career networking. Findings - The positive relationship, in many instances, is curvilinear and highlights the downfall of working excessive hours. We also explore whether adolescent work for a stranger or family member leads to different outcomes, and find that working in a family business leads to enhanced later life utilization of career networks as well as better person-organization fit. Social implications - While we find that adolescent work intensity is linked to positive later life outcomes such as higher income, better fitting jobs, and better career networks, we also find maxima whereby additional hours worked have a diminishing effect on the outcomes. This suggests the need for societal norms and/or laws to avoid excessive adolescent work. Value of chapter - The findings in this chapter shed light on the role of early life work experiences in future professional outcomes. We show that certain types of adolescent employment can enhance future career prospects, counter to much of the established literature on the detrimental impact of youth labor.",2014"Casciaro, Tiziana",AFFECT IN ORGANIZATIONAL NETWORKS,CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVES ON ORGANIZATIONAL SOCIAL NETWORKS,"I draw on psychological and sociological theories of affect to depict the relatively stable set of moods and emotions that an individual experiences in social interactions with a given person (relational affect) as a fundamental engine of social action influencing both how and with whom employees perform assigned tasks.

This idea builds upon the observation that creative ideas are ""often the result of the assemblage of different perspectives and approaches people are exposed to via social interactions."" (Baer, 2010, p 592) When the suspicions and doubts inherent in these different perspectives are prematurely pruned, known facts and low-risk understanding replace innovation and breakthrough KM activity. This is a problem that plagues Japan today. An aversion to interactions with people outside of a small in-group impedes knowledge sharing in Japan, and now manifests itself through ""KM anxieties"" as an obstacle to innovation, economic competitiveness, and understanding of the outside world. KM anxieties are not unique to the Japanese, but they are perhaps more prevalent due to Japanese reluctance to establish or explore what Granovetter (1973) called ""weak ties."" This situation largely exists due to confidence issues involved in dealing with strangers and unverified knowledge, and could be rectified if software agents were used to establish acceptable trust situations with previously unknown actors and information. With these ideas in mind, this paper considers three main themes. The first theme, addressed in section two of this paper, explores the importance of weak ties for knowledge sharing. In section three we examine the reasons for the pervasive condition of limited trust situations in Japanese society. We then probe the need and role for software agents in mitigating the trust problem in section four. It is expected that these discussions will contribute to the extant literature on and our understanding of the importance of weak ties in KM, the future role of software agents in facilitating communications and interaction between strangers, and the means by which Japan may once again engage the world in KM activities and regain its innovative edge.",2014"Denoo, Lien; Clarysse, Bart; Smith, Celina",THE IMPACT OF FOUNDERS' PROACTIVE PERSONALITY ON TIE STRENGTH TO ACQUIRE STARTUP RESOURCES,"ADVANCING EUROPEAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP RESEARCH: ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A WORKING ATTITUDE, A MODE OF THINKING AND AN EVERYDAY PRACTICE","We investigate the impact of entrepreneurs' personality orientations on their ability to exploit the benefits of social capital. The results reported here indicate that proactive entrepreneurs are more likely to search beyond their existing networks to access cognitively distant opportunities, and to access these via weak ties. This is the case even when they already have a strong tie network. Non-proactive personality types, in contrast, are more predisposed to search close at hand and to rely upon strong network ties to access opportunities. We draw on a database of 100 new high technology entrepreneurs based in Belgium between 2006 and 2011.

Although academic interest in isolation is long-standing, recent years have seen an explosion of research on the topic.

To do this, we use a theoretical multidisciplinary perspective of scientific collaborations, which combines the approach of networking and resource sharing (Granovetter, 1973, Lin, 2001) with a sociological approach to power relations (Bourdieu, 1997). Following the intuition of Nan Lin (2001), we conclude that the positions of researchers in institutional hierarchies are crucial to the way they access resources. Occupying an elevated position represents a sure and steady exchange of resources.

In the two industries examined, strong ties are associated with exploitation whilst mixed features of strong and weak ties benefit exploration. This is in contrast to the findings of Gilsing and Nooteboom (2005) and suggests that tie strength associated with exploitation and exploration differs according to the industrial context in which firms operate. The findings also suggest different streams of capabilities are required to manage supplier relationships. In exploitation strong ties facilitate capabilities to identify new opportunities, to form a collective to pool resources and to work across organisational boundaries. In exploration weak ties are conducive to the search for new ideas but impede firms' capability to realise potential innovations.

Design/methodology/approach - A single case study was conducted within a business unit at a multinational medical technology company. Data were collected through a mixed method. Findings - The results show that many R&D employees lack social networks through which they can acquire information about the users' needs. However, some R&D employees establish cost-efficient relationships to people with a direct experience of using the company's products. These relationships are established over time and are often used in a rather informal way to acquire user information. Moreover, the results show how R&D employees are purposefully complementing these relationships with more occasional interactions with people who hold direct and indirect use experiences. Research limitations/implications - As with most single-case studies, it will be important to replicate this investigation in other contexts to clarify the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications - The article shows how important it is that management provides R&D employees with opportunities to establish, nurture and utilize relationships conducive to information about the users' needs. The article provides some advice on how this can be accomplished.

The results of empirical study show that when opposite e-WOM messages from strong ties, consumers will be more influenced by the later e-WOM message. Hence, consumer attitude will be more positive in negative-positive e-WOM order than positive-negative order. However, when consumers receive opposite e-WOM messages from weak ties, consumer attitude will be more influenced by negative e-WOM instead of e-WOM presentation order.

More companies in recent years have reduced their advertising expenditures on traditional media. Instead, they focus more on word-of-mouth marketing to reach their potential customers. Design/methodology/approach - A2 (high/low utilitarian message context) x 2 (high/low hedonic message context) x 2 (message source: strong/weak tie strength) x 2 (channel: e-mail/blog) between-subjects experiment was conducted. A total of 363 completed questionnaires were collected in Taiwan. Findings - The findings are fourfold. First, the greater the tie strength between the sender and the receiver, the more actively they share information. Second, an audience is more willing to share a message with others when the message contains higher degrees of utilitarian or hedonic values. Third, those who are highly involved with the products are more willing to share information than those who are less involved. Fourth, those who access the information via blogs are more willing to share information with others.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors draw on social capital theory to conceptually derive propositions on the role of social capital with regard to the antecedents of opportunism in service triads. Findings - Based on literature, the authors show how social capital between service buyer and partner firm decreases the service buyer's opportunism risk regarding the provider's behavior. Structural capital enhances information flows, thus reducing ambiguity. Relational capital reduces ambiguity as well as the service buyer' dependence. Cognitive capital enhances the mitigating effect of relational norms. Research limitations/implications - The authors extend the conceptual perspective on social capital and opportunism risk to triadic environments. Besides empirical validation, a resulting research program could follow three avenues: interdependencies between other relationships in service triads, the impact of social capital on effects other than opportunism as well as the role of relationships between individual boundary-spanners. Practical implications - When deciding upon service outsourcing in triads, service buyers should assess their resulting opportunism risk, considering not only the service provider but also their relationship to the partner firm.

Design/methodology/approach - Social network and general attribute survey responses from 331 employees were analyzed through hierarchical linear modeling to verify the study's multi-level research model and hypotheses. Findings - A recipient's trust in colleagues positively influences knowledge transfer and company tenure has a negative impact. At a dyadic level, the perceived expertise of a source, in addition to strength of ties, exerts a positive effect on knowledge transfer. Additionally, a recipient's network centrality moderates the effects of dyadic relationships on knowledge transfer. Research limitations/implications - This study deepened the current understanding of the role of social capital in knowledge transfer from a recipient's perspective. Three dimensions of a recipient's social capital respectively showed significant, but different types of influence on knowledge transfer. Interaction effects between individual and dyadic level antecedents should be considered as well. Practical implications - Both a strong tie at a dyadic level and a diverse network at an individual level should be nurtured to facilitate knowledge transfer. In addition, bi-directional knowledge transfer between seasoned employees and new employees should be promoted.

This creativity can attract audiences and generate commercial success for blog service providers (BSPs). Thus to obtain competitive advantage, such providers should stimulate their bloggers to produce creative content. The purpose of this paper is to adopt social embeddedness and creativity theory to explore factors influencing blogger creativity. Design/methodology/approach - An online questionnaire and an online embeddedness system are used to collect data from 353 bloggers, including data on their motivation, integration ability, structural and relational embeddedness and creativity. Hierarchical regression is applied for statistical analysis. Findings - Analytical results show that structural embeddedness and relational embeddedness affect blogger creativity. Additionally motivation negatively moderates the relationship between structural embeddedness and creativity, and integration ability negatively moderates the relationship between relational embeddedness and creativity.

The Diffusion of Tactical Innovation in Social Movement Networks, the Case of Suffragette Militancy",SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES,"This paper explores the diffusion of a tactical innovation - militancy - within the British Suffrage Movement, 1905 - 1914. It concentrates upon the influences that arise from personal social networks and which affect ego's decision about whether to adopt the new tactic. UCINET is used to map and visualise the activist networks of two suffragettes who made different adoption decisions. This reveals that 'weak ties' to 'innovation champions' (i. e. suffragette 'travelling organisers') connected both women to opportunities to learn about, observe and adopt militancy. In order to explain why one suffragette adopted the tactic and the other did not, however, there is a need to link structural and cultural analyses of social networks together. Here, I do this by following up empirically what Fuhse [Fuhse, J. (2009). The meaning structure of social networks. Sociological Theory, 27, 51-73] has called the 'meaning structure of the network' consisting of interpersonal expectations and network culture. I propose that the 'meaning structure' of the network is linked to the structural patterning of social ties - and the subjective meanings of ego - through the communicative interaction in which they both are rooted [Mische, A. (2003). Cross-talk in movements: Rethinking the culture-network link. In M. Diani & D. McAdam (Eds.), Social movements and networks: Relational approaches to collective action (pp. 258 - 280). Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press]. Focusing on communicative interaction and intersubjective meanings indicates that there is value in approaching personal networks as socio-cultural 'lifeworlds' [Habermas, J. (1987).

Design/methodology/approach - Descriptions of networking are reviewed and an integrated definition of networking in organizations is presented. Approaches for measuring and studying networking are considered and the similarities and differences of networking with related constructs are discussed. A theoretical model of the antecedents and outcomes of networking is presented with the goal of integrating existing networking research. Mechanisms through which networking leads to individual and organizational outcomes are also considered. Findings - Networking is defined as goal-directed behavior which occurs both inside and outside of an organization, focussed on creating, cultivating, and utilizing interpersonal relationships. The current model proposes that networking is influenced by a variety of individual, job, and organizational level factors and leads to increased visibility and power, job performance, organizational access to strategic information, and career success. Access to information and social capital are proposed as mechanisms that facilitate the effects of networking on outcomes. Originality/value - Networking is held to be of great professional value for ambitious individuals and organizations. However, much of the research on networking has been spread across various disciplines. Consequentially, consensus on many important topics regarding networking remains notably elusive.

So, determining factors that may influence knowledge sharing within an organization or among organizations has become an important area of research. This paper aims to review determinant factors influencing inter- and intra-organizational knowledge sharing in order to offer a framework. Design/methodology/approach - The present paper proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, the published literature on knowledge sharing has been reviewed extensively with consideration of their empirical applications. Next, based on the understanding gained from the previous stage, a conceptual framework of successful factors for effective inter- organizational knowledge sharing has been proposed. In the third phase, the proposed framework has been developed and finalized towards its maturity. Findings - Based on the literature, the authors have developed a framework for understanding factors which influence inter- organizational knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing among organizations appears theoretically sound, but it is a difficult task due to some complexities. Research limitations/implications - This paper attempts to set a theoretical framework for inter- organizational knowledge sharing as a foundation to address the gap in current literature though it does not claim to be comprehensive. Originality/value - A few attempts have been made to investigate success factors for inter- organizational knowledge sharing empirically or even theoretically, but this is the first of its kind that provides a theoretical framework to arrange success factors for the knowledge sharing based on inter- organizational collaborations.

However, less attention is paid to their robustness against either noise or irrationality of a link which exists in almost all of real networks. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of several typical node-similarity-based algorithms and find that these algorithms are sensitive to the strength of noise. Moreover, we find that it also depends on the structure properties of networks, especially on network efficiency, clustering coefficient and average degree.

Related studies to border relations observe the weakness of these informal border contacts and relations. However, weak ties represent an opportunity for interaction, and little has been said about how they might play in the construction and performance of institutional cross-border cooperation (CBC). In this work, we examine the nature of personal border networks of professionals working in CBC and how they are interconnected with the institutional CBC. This paper is based on a mainly qualitative research of two different border regions: Andalusia, Algarve and Alentejo (AAA) and South Finland and Estonia (SFE). Nevertheless, the methodology is multi-method, using semi-structured interviews, with specific questions for applying a social network analysis. Conclusions point out different patterns of border relations in both border regions. In AAA, most of the cross-border relations are weaker and related to their professional involvement in institutional CBC. In SFE, border relations rely both on working and personal reasons.

It is reasonable that both social relationships-strong or weak-may have domestic position in employment decisions because different cultural backgrounds may lead to several of behavior patterns. On one hand, strong ties are important for positions which are crucial and scarce, especially when one's personality is not distinctive.

Interpartner trust develops through the mechanisms of trust transfer and trust conversion, and managing both is an important management issue. The research question to be answered in this chapter is, How to manage trust-building processes and methods in public-private strategic alliances? The five processes of connection, communication, direction, temporary groups, and resource-sharing are found to build trust in interpartner contexts. Moreover, the processes of connection, communication, and temporary groups are found to contribute to the mechanism of trust transfer, while the process of direction appears to contribute to the mechanism of trust conversion. Although the process of resource-sharing is found to contribute mostly to the mechanism of trust transfer, when the managers get their employees to share resources with their alliance partners, this process may also contribute to trust conversion. Moreover, managing these processes consciously constitutes top-down processes that contribute to trust conversion. This chapter discusses in depth these five trust-building processes both theoretically and practically, and develops an outline of how the processes might be managed in practice. Furthermore, several methods or tools that entail one or more of the trust-building processes are presented; and four cases from public private settings further illustrate how the processes and methods can be used, or not used, in practice. The findings show that applying and managing the trust-building processes and methods has a positive influence on trust-building in public private alliances.",2014"Chollet, Barthelemy; Geraudel, Mickael; Mothe, Caroline",Generating Business Referrals for SMEs: The Contingent Value of CEOs' Social Capital*,JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT,"We examine how small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) chief executive officers' (CEOs) social capital (as measured by strength of ties and structural holes) can help them bring business to their firms through the spread of positive referrals.

Design/methodology/approach - The study develops and tests a theoretical model whereby groupings include project team, community of practice (CoP), community of interest (Col), and knowledge network (KN). Organizational performance is supported on financial, process, internal, and cultural aspects. Based on a questionnaire, data was obtained from a sample of 142 companies in North America. The measurement model was tested and confirmed by using structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings - The results confirm the positive effects of knowledge networks and communities of interest. However, the impact of project teams turned out to be negative, and communities of practice were not shown to affect corporate performance. Additionally, the results underscore the importance of organizational networks in creating conditions favorable to a firm's success.

The empirical data demonstrate that participants note higher levels of dissatisfaction when they are in the company of social companions than when they are alone. Moreover, the presence of strong ties would have an inhibitory effect on the expression of dissatisfaction relative to the presence of weak ties, whereas the effects of weak ties would depend on the group size and consumption goals. With hedonic consumption goals, the weak tie customer expresses higher dissatisfaction when the group size is small rather than when it is large. In contrast, with utilitarian consumption goals, the weak tie customers' dissatisfaction is higher when the group size is larger than when it is small.

We test this interpretation using two Italian parties of the 1970s that played major roles in shaping political and social life of the country: the Christian Democrats, or DC, and the Communists, or PCI. The 1970s saw the culmination of the DC and PCI's two-party dominance of the Italian state. Further, it was during this same period that the economic and social contradictions of Italy's tumultuous post-World War II process of industrialization became apparent, making social cleavages easy to grasp. We use cosponsoring of bills between parliamentary members as a measure of formal and informal relationships within each party. We deem this appropriate in the context of a pure proportional electoral system and highly polarized audiences. Data comes from the lower chamber of the Parliament during the Sixth Legislative cycle (1972-1977). We use HLM to model dyadic interactions between MPs and distinguish between repeated cosponsoring of bills (strong ties) and single occurrences of cosponsoring (weak ties). Our results show that within each party, national cleavages significantly increased the likelihood of strong ties but were not relevant in structuring weak ties. We conclude that the party has an internal structure made of a network of MPs informed by external social cleavages and held together by the common goal of being reelected. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

They are caused by two or more groups of machines that are interconnected by weak ties. To damp out the inter-area oscillations, this paper proposes the new application of wide area stability control for robust centralized power oscillation dampers (PODs) design of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbines. The POD with 2nd-order lead/lag compensator structure for each DFIG wind turbine is located at the control center. To stabilize the target inter-area mode effectively, the geometric measures of controllability and observability are used to choose the suitable DFIG wind turbine for stabilizing the target oscillation mode, the proper input signal of POD, and the location of phasor measurement units (PMUs). The input signal of each POD is obtained from PMU while the output signal is transmitted to the rotor side converter voltage controller of DFIG. As a result, the reactive power output of DFIG can be modulated to damp out inter-area oscillations. In the POD parameters optimization, the wide range of power output levels of DFIGs and synchronous generators, time delays due to wide area communication, and unstructured system uncertainties model are taken into account so that the damping of inter-area modes and the system robust stability margin against uncertainties can be guaranteed. Solving the problem by the firefly algorithm automatically, the optimal parameters of PODs can be achieved. The stabilizing performance and robustness of the proposed robust centralized POD are evaluated in the IEEE New England 39 bus system by eigenvalue analyses and nonlinear simulation in scenarios with severe short circuits, N-1 outage contingencies, heavy power flows, and line tripping.",2014"Oatley, Giles; Crick, Tom",Exploring UK Crime Networks,2014 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM 2014),"This paper describes our experiences with three different crime networks in the UK: burglary, 'gun' gangs and retail theft.

In this essay, we make the case for rediscovering the inherent interplay between formal organization and informal social structure given their common basis of interactions in organizations.

Researchers conventionally assume these conceptualizations are interchangeable as social ties, and some employ composite measures that aim to capture more than one dimension. Even so, important discrepancies often appear for non-ties (as dyads where a specific role relation or sentiment is not reported, a specific form of interaction is not observed, or exchange is not possible). Methodology/approach - Investigating the interplay across the four definitions is a step toward developing scope conditions for generalization and application of theory across these domains. Research implications - This step is timely because emerging tools of computational social science - wearable sensors, logs of telecommunication, online exchange, or other interaction - now allow us to observe the fine-grained dynamics of interaction over time. Combined with cutting-edge methods for analysis, these lenses allow us to move beyond reified notions of social ties (and non-ties) and instead directly observe and analyze the dynamic and structural interdependencies of social interaction behavior.

Three factors increase the odds of individual ownership: (a) the extent to which the resources valued by alters belong to the individual (rather than the organization), (b) the degree to which alters feel greater indebtedness to the individual than to the organization, and (c) the extent to which relationships involve emotional attachment.

Bridging social capital refers to ""weak ties''-loose connections between individuals who may provide useful information or new perspectives; bonding social capital is accumulated through ""strong ties""-relationships with family and close friends; maintaining social capital refers to the ability of getting assistance from a previously inhabited community. Research shows that social relationships with friends and neighbors as well with Facebook friends are related to indices of psychological well-being, such as self-esteem and satisfaction with life. These social relationships and well-being of the participants may be affected by their willingness to disclose personal. In addition, self-disclosure itself might be affected by personality traits and privacy concerns of the participants. This study examines the impact of e-privacy management and personality traits on the extent of disclosing personal information on social network Facebook, which in turn is related to bonding and bridging social capital and to the participants' well-being. The research crosschecks a quantitative online surveying 115 Facebook users (age 18-37, 40% male) with a qualitative investigation of 12 participants revealing their personal experience in the network. The online survey included 5 parts. (1) Participant e-privacy management was assessed as ""public account"", ""account open to friends only"" and ""custom account"". (2) Introversion-extraversion personality trait was measured based on the Big Five personality model (Costa & McCrae, 1992). (3) Self-disclosure was assessed by online self-disclosure questionnaire (Leung, 2002). (4) Social capital was measured by the Social Capital Scale adapted to the Facebook context (Ellison et al., 2007). (5) Psychological well-being was assessed by the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener et al., 1985) and by Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1989). In the qualitative part of this study face-to-face semi-structured interviews explored participants' experiences and reasons for a particular preference of e-privacy management, as well as their perceptions of social and psychological benefits and costs of disclosing personal information through the social networking platform. The analyses of variance indicated that managing privacy settings affects the depth, honesty, and the intent of self-disclosure on Facebook. However, participant extroversion-introversion trait affected the intent of self-disclosure, but not its depth and honesty. These results are consistent with the impact of social networking on introverts according to the ""poor get richer"" claim. Pearson correlations indicate that people revealing personal information in an honest way, tend to be satisfied with their lives, and people who have high awareness of exposure of personal information on the social network value themselves positively. In addition, high social capital is associated with a high level of life satisfaction. The results of the qualitative analysis raised five main themes of personal experiences on Facebook: (1) reference to reasons for sharing information, (2) expressing privacy concerns, (3) sharing of selective information in order to address privacy concerns, (4) accumulation of social capital as a benefit of social networking and (5) diminishing a negative consequence of online information sharing - information overload.",2014"Stam, Wouter; Arzlanian, Souren; Elfring, Tom",Social capital of entrepreneurs and small firm performance: A meta-analysis of contextual and methodological moderators,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING,"Despite a surge of studies examining the role of social capital in the entrepreneurial process, no quantitative assessments exist of the empirical evidence to date. To resolve seemingly conflicting results, we conducted a meta-analysis of the link between entrepreneurs' personal networks and small firm performance and identify new moderators affecting this relationship. Analyses of 61 independent samples indicated that the social capital-performance link was positive and significant (r(c)=.211). Effect sizes of weak ties were smaller than those of structural holes, while network diversity had the largest positive effect on performance. Results also showed that the social capital-performance link depends on the age of small firms, the industry and institutional contexts in which they operate, and on the specific network or performance measures used.

Design/methodology/approach - This research conducts multiple case studies on the organizational knowledge paths of six companies in the multiple industries through social network analysis (SNA) tool developed by the authors of this paper. Findings - This study provides four major findings which shed a new light on how to comprehend the features of knowledge flow and the role-specific nodes in knowledge networks in organizations: the within-business unit knowledge flows are more dominant over the inter-business units knowledge flow; the downward knowledge flows are dominant over the horizontal and upward knowledge flows in the management levels; distributions of knowledge owners and providers are like L-shape and the gap between knowledge owing and providing expands as the management levels go up; and the top 20 percent people in an organization dominate over a large portion of the knowledge brokerage activities.

Individuals and organisations are becoming increasingly involved in collaboration networks to share knowledge and generate innovation. SC theory has been adopted in several areas of study to explain how individuals, groups and organisations manage relationships to generate innovation. Design/methodology/approach - This review covers studies of SC in organisational behaviour, strategy and management over a period of 20 years. Findings - The literature review shows that knowledge types and knowledge transfer processes are the missing links in the relationship between structural SC and innovation. Moreover, the paper demonstrates that seemingly opposite configurations of SC are complementary to each other (structural holes vs dense networks; strong vs weak ties) and that contextual factors should be considered when discussing the effects of SC on knowledge transfer and innovation. In addition, it is the balance of different configurations of SC which enables an individual or a company to explore, access, assimilate and combine different knowledge types, which will lead to improved innovation outcomes.

Findings - As the article's major theoretical contribution, the results demonstrate that CID is more efficient in a network of weak ties than in a network of strong ties, and that the spread of CID has a positive correlation with the believability of the information disseminated and the dissemination tendency coefficient. Furthermore, the difference of dissemination speeds between strong and weak tie networks varies regularly with information believability and the dissemination tendency coefficient.

One of the important properties of this network structure is referred to as social capital, which is the network of contacts and the associated values attached to these networks of contacts. This study provides empirical evidence of the influence of social capital and performance within the context of academic collaboration (coauthorship) and suggests that the collaborative process involves social capital embedded within relationships and network structures among direct coauthors. Association between scholars' social capital and their citation-based performance measures is examined. To overcome the limitations of traditional social network metrics for measuring the influence of scholars' social capital within coauthorship networks, the traditional social network metrics is extended by proposing two new measures, of which one is non-weighted (the power-diversity index) and the other (power-tie-diversity index) is weighted by the number of collaboration instances. The Spearman's correlation rank test is used to examine the association between scholars' social capital measures and their citation-based performance. Results suggest that research performance of authors is positively correlated with their social capital measures.

Extant research has paid extremely attention to the effect of both geographic cluster and industrial network on firms' performance; however, little studies have delineated the relationship between geographic cluster, industrial network, and competitive advantage. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that firms within the same cluster that have established idiosyncratic network resources have stronger competitive advantages than firms that have not. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical study of two prominent geographic clusters from Taiwan is analyzed by structural equation modeling. Findings - The results indicate that the degree of networking does play a mediating role between geographic cluster and competitive advantage, which may help resolve the conflicting results obtained by researchers on the influence of clusters on competitive advantage. The results also find that both degree of networking and betweenness position are conducive to the pursuit of competitive advantage. Practical implications - The research shows that firms merely locate themselves in the right cluster does not guarantee they can outperform their rivals. Rather, developing of network relationship with other firms proximate to the same cluster will strengthen a firm's competitive advantages. Originality/value - In the theoretical perspective, this paper attempts to fill the gap in the links between clusters, networks, and competitive advantage by providing that the networking as a mechanism for firms in a cluster to improve their competitive advantage.",2014"Chiu, Terry Hui-Ye; Chen, Chien-Chou; Joung, Yuh-Jzer; Chen, Shymin",A study of blog networks to determine online social network properties from the tie strength perspective,ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW,"Purpose - Most studies on tie strength have focused on its definition, calculation and applications, but have not paid much attention to how tie strength can help analyse online social networks. Because ties play different roles in a network depending on their strength, the purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between tie strength and network behaviours. Design/methodology/approach - The authors propose a simplemetric for tie strength measurement and then apply it to an online social network extracted from a blog network. These networks are massive in size and have technology for efficient data collection, thereby presenting the possibility of measuring tie strength objectively. From the results several key social network properties are studied to see how tie strength may be used as a metric to explain certain characteristics in social networks. Findings - The online networks exhibit all the structural properties of an actual social network, not only in following the power law but also with regard to the distribution of tie strength. The authors noted a strong association between tie strength and reciprocity, and tie strength and transitivity in online social networks.

Typically, a population is characterized by its community structure and the heterogeneity in the weak ties among nodes bridging over communities. We propose and study an effective algorithm that searches for bridge hubs, which are bridge nodes with a larger number of weak ties, as immunizing targets based on the idea of referencing to an expanding friendship circle as a self-avoiding walk proceeds. Applying the algorithm to simulated networks and empirical networks constructed from social network data of five US universities, we show that the algorithm is more effective than other existing local algorithms for a given immunization coverage, with a reduced final epidemic ratio, lower peak prevalence and fewer nodes that need to be visited before identifying the target nodes. The effectiveness stems from the breaking up of community networks by successful searches on target nodes with more weak ties. The effectiveness remains robust even when errors exist in the structure of the networks.",2013"Chalmers, Adam W.",With a lot of help from their friends: Explaining the social logic of informational lobbying in the European Union,EUROPEAN UNION POLITICS,"This article examines the informational advantages of interest group networking strategies and how these relate to the provision of policy-relevant information to EU decision-makers.

INTRAORGANIZATIONAL NETWORKS, KNOWLEDGE, AND FIRMS' ABILITY TO INNOVATE THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL RECOMBINATION",STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,"A firm's innovativeness is driven by its ability to recombine existing technologies. Elaborating on this argument, we contend that there exist two distinct types of recombinant capabilities. First, firms may innovate through recombinant creation, i.e., by creating technological combinations new to the firm. Second, they may innovate through recombinant reuse; i.e., by reconfiguring combinations already known to the firm. We study what drives each type of capability by examining two factors: the degree of integration of a firm's intraorganizational network and the diversity of its knowledge base. We test our theoretical predictions using data on 126 semiconductor firms between 1984 and 2003. Our analyses indicate that factors that favor recombinant creation generally hinder recombinant reuse and vice versa; however, combining an integrated collaboration network and a diverse knowledge base may concurrently enhance both recombinant capabilities.

The explosive growth of open innovation intermediary networks, such as InnoCentive or Linked-in, enables the rapid pairing of firms seeking knowledge to address a wide range of business challenges (seekers) with other firms or individuals who already have relevant knowledge (solvers or knowledge brokers). These intermediary networks allow procurement departments to source codified and un-codified knowledge from firms or individuals outside their traditional supplier networks using one-off transactional relationships. Although sourcing ideas in this way theoretically poses problems for knowledge search and transfer, we have found that companies can draw on processes and integration mechanisms developed by procurement and design engineering to develop effective organizational learning routines.

However, some have critiqued the public sphere on grounds of equal access and portrayed civil society as a guise for first-world imperialism. These critiques have implications for the role of public relations in the public sphere and civil society. This article suggests the normative role of public relations in democracy is best perceived as creating the social capital that facilitates access to spheres of public discussion and in maintaining relationships among those organizations that check state power. To that end, the paper argues that social capital does much to advance public relations theory and prescribe the role of public relations in democracy. Several implications for public relations from a social capital perspective are offered, including the creation of generalized societal trust, the building of cross-cutting or ""weak"" ties, the engagement of media on behalf of subaltern counterpublics, and the (re)creation of community or a fully functioning society.

With a focus on both Japanese expatriate and host national employees in a Japanese organisation in Indonesia, this ethnographic study examines the ways in which they worked in unfamiliar circumstances, managed differences and provided essential support for each other. Their transnational connections, characterised by what Granovetter calls the strength of weak ties', function to diffuse information and knowledge effectively.

This paper attempts to demonstrate the vital roles of expatriate and host national employees as mediators, by using network analysis as a framework.

This research effort contributes to a growing stream of research in social network theory suggesting that the contradictory theories of the strength of weak ties and weak network structures on the one hand and the theory of strong ties and closed network structures on the other have a mutually reinforcing effect on innovation outcomes if combined rather than considered separately. An in-depth exploratory single case study approach within an innovatively organized national R&D collaboration allowed giving further evidence for such a superior innovation performance and for this research to contribute to theory by demonstrating why and how such a combination may lead to higher innovation output and how this effect can be actively reinforced. It is suggested that the combination of strong and weak ties should occur at the individual rather than at the project or firm level. The authors distinguish between the additive effects of the respective innovation benefits of strong and weak ties, a positive interaction effect in the portfolio of dyadic ties of an individual and a second multilevel interaction effect of weak ties embedded in the ambidextrous network structure. Referring to previous empirical findings, intellectual property regulation and structural interdependency between network members showed a higher impact than trust with regard to leveraging weak ties and are important sources for achieving the multilevel interaction effect. Managerial implications of this research are that a large network will outperform several smaller, independent networks given that the right structure and processes are in place.

To solve this puzzle, we clarify the distinction between having social capital and using contacts as a search method. We present theoretical reasons to suggest that the lack of an association between a job seeker's social capital and whether or not she uses social networks to search for a job should not be taken to imply that job seekers who use social networks to search for jobs do not benefit from using contacts. We exploit a strategic research setting, the school-to-work transition of 291 university graduates who engaged in 3,112 contemporaneous job searches, to show that although a job seeker's social capital may not affect whether or not she uses contacts to search for a job, using contacts as a job-search method does improve her job-search outcomes.

In using Facebook, pupils acquire bridging and bonding social capital; they maintain an extensive network of weak ties that are a source of bridging capital, and deeper relationships that provide them with emotional support and a source of bonding capital. Key differences between the participants were found in the expression of emotional support.

Two measures of social capital are used: the size of friendship network with native Koreans and the prestige score of occupational categories of the network contacts. Multilevel analysis reveals that while controlling for a host of individual- and contextual-level factors, ethnicity-based networks are significant in allowing foreign wives to build social capital in the host society.

Young people in Egypt and the larger Middle East have been disproportionately disadvantaged by neoliberalism and a demographic youth bulge. They were economically excluded by high unemployment and insecure jobs in the informal sector; they were politically excluded by authoritarianism and state repression; and they were socially excluded by the limbo of ""waithood,"" or prolonged adolescence as marriage and entry into adulthood was delayed, in part due to the high cost of marriage. Yet, at the same time, these commonly shared grievances facilitated weak ties linking diverse constituencies together, as creative leaders built a ""movement of movements."" The April 6 movement, and Kefaya before it, creatively adopted a non-hierarchical model of collective action that was organically suited to the vast informal and subterranean networks already dominant within Egyptian life. Young women and men risked their lives pursuing regime change, and one of the master frames of the uprisings, that demanded ""dignity"" may provide particular opportunities for the women's movement. A gendered concept, dignity suggests that the state must respect the integrity, safety, and autonomy of the body.

While the knowledge management literature extensively considers the significant impact of relationships and trust on sharing knowledge, the underlying reasoning behind individual choices to share knowledge and expertise largely remains an underexplored area. Bourdieu's conception of the habitus is used as an alternative tool to interpret individual dynamics and their propensity for sharing knowledge given their personal relationships. Data are drawn from in-depth interviews conducted across the organization and presented as a narrative indicative of relationship dynamics of individual actors. The findings suggest that individual predisposition towards knowledge sharing is influenced by experiences in sustained relationships, coupled with awareness of knowledge sources, expectations of reciprocity in relationships, and acceptance into social groups. Particularly, the predisposing nature of the habitus serves as guide to location and utilization of knowledge sources as well as on choices to share personal knowledge.",2013"Chua, Vincent",Categorical sources of varieties of network inequalities,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,"Dominant gender and ethnic groups do have more social capital than their less dominant counterparts, but there are variations in the types of social capital to which they have access. This study of Singapore finds that men have greater access than women to forms of social capital such as ties to men, weak ties, and non-kin. By contrast, Chinese Singaporeans have greater access to forms of social capital such as ties to university graduates, private housing dwellers, Chinese, and weak ties, than do other ethnicities. These distinctive patterns of network inequalities are bound up with distinctive patterns of access to organizations such as schools, workplaces, and voluntary associations. The paper finds that network inequalities among gender and ethnic groups have more to do with barriers of entry to those organizations and less to do with social capital being added more efficaciously for some members. The paper underscores a need to better understand the complex intersections between ascriptive social categories, organizations, and social capital. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate when business knowledge obtained from interpersonal ties in more-developed countries is more useful than locally sourced knowledge. Using a sample of South African managers, we find that knowledge from more-developed countries is not always more useful. Rather, overseas knowledge is preferable when novel and accessible: that is, when new-to-the-industry knowledge is needed, when there is already a strong tie, and when the knowledge does not involve a long discussion. Conversely, local knowledge is preferable when new-to-the-industry knowledge is not needed, when the interpersonal tie is a weak tie, and when a longer discussion is warranted.

In addition to data on demonstration participation in general, we also use the data on the Rose Marches that were organized after the 22/7 terror events as a critical case. Our results show that the type of participant mobilized via the social media is characterized by lower socioeconomic status and younger age than those mobilized via other channels.

There has not been any systematic empirical study of the dynamics of emerging coordination behaviour and knowledge transfer process during a disease outbreak. In this paper, we first introduce our approach for the analysis of multi-agency intervention during a disease outbreak using the study of social networks. Using social networks and its analytic framework, we explore questions such as: How does the multi-agency coordination emerge for supporting the complex knowledge transfer process during different phases of disease outbreak? How effective are these formal and informal coordination mechanisms in achieving a robust outcome in response coordination through effective knowledge transfer process during the outbreak? What are the key lessons learned by studying the emerging coordination and knowledge transfer process during past disease outbreak in improving the multi-agency preparedness for dealing with future outbreaks? The discussion is supported by a qualitative study of the implementation of the results of the analysis. We reveal that profound understanding of social network behaviour and emerging coordination concepts are pivotal to the optimisation of knowledge transfer process which is a prerequisite for successful outbreak intervention.

Based on merged objective and survey data from 255 surgeons in 18 medical universities and hospitals in the U.

Creative city to Tech City in east London,CITIES,"This paper presents an initial analysis of a creative digital cluster which emerged in east London in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Drawing on spatial analysis of sector and firm level data, the eastward trajectory of a new wave of digital creative activity, and its particular mix of co-located sectors, is placed within the wider context of the geography of London's creative and digital economies. The particular dynamics of this cluster - its sector combinations, markets and firm organisation - are creating a localised spike of economic vitality. The relative strength of this new cluster is contrasted with the faltering position of longstanding local craft and arts based creative industries. Analysis of a sample of 261 firms suggests that the current vitality of this cluster emerges from risky experimentation across co-located sectors in which hitherto unrelated knowledges and activities are being combined. A core role for hybrid firms - creative digital agencies - is suggested. These firms show many of characteristics already identified for creative SMEs, including their tendency to agglomerate in and benefit from specialised clusters within urban economies. However, these firms also appear to have internalised the sector and skill diversity commonly identified as the primary positive externalities of urban economies. It is also noted that this self-organising creative digital cluster is producing spatially embedded 'noisy' networks with a multitude of weak ties. This cluster arrangement appears therefore to be a mechanism for mediating the high degrees of uncertainty and risk in London's creative digital sector, currently exacerbated by the recessionary conditions of London's post 2008 economy.

Firms can post wage offers in the regular job market, alternatively they can save on advertising costs and rely on word-of-mouth communication. Wages are then negotiated ex-post between the firm and the applicant, so the model can generate wage premiums or penalties depending on the parameter of bargaining power. Moreover, this paper shows that the traditional Hosios (1990) condition continues to hold in an economy with family contacts but it fails to provide efficiency in the economy with weak ties. There are two reasons for the inefficiency. First, workers bargaining over wages do not internalize the positive external effect on their contacts, originating from a higher probability of finding a job. This network externality puts an upward pressure on wages so the market tightness in the referral market is distorted downwards. Second, weak ties do not act in full interest of the unemployed worker so their search intensity is inefficiently low. Finally, this paper shows that a combination of a hiring subsidy and a referral bonus can decentralize the efficient allocation in the economy with weak ties. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Nearly all previous empirical research has ignored friendship ties and has largely neglected extended-family ties. Using longitudinal data from the Migration between Africa and Europe project collected in Africa (Senegal) and Europe (France, Italy, and Spain), this article tests the robustness of network theory-and in particular, the role of weak ties-on first-time migration between Senegal and Europe. Discrete-time hazard model results confirm that weak ties are important and that network influences appear to be gendered, but they do not uphold the contention in previous literature that strong ties are more important than weak ties for male and female migration. Indeed, weak ties play an especially important role in male migration. In terms of network resources, having more resources as a result of strong ties appears to dampen overall migration, while having more resources as a result of weaker ties appears to stimulate male migration. Finally, the diversity of resources has varied effects for male and female migration.",2013"Chen, Wenhong","Internet Use, Online Communication, and Ties in Americans' Networks",SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPUTER REVIEW,"Drawing on nationally representative survey data, this article examines the implications of Internet use and online communication for strong and weak ties in Americans' social networks.

Studying three cases of solution providers which involve external service partners for solution delivery, we find that solution customer centricity - the degree to which the focal firm focuses on solution customers in the joint delivery of solutions - moderates the relationship between partner networks and open business model performance. For open business models with low solution customer centricity, a network configuration characterized by many weak ties to service partners leads to superior performance. Conversely, for open business models with high solution customer centricity, few but strong ties to partners lead to superior performance. Based on these findings, three ideal configurations of networks for open business models are derived: the controlled, the Joint, and the supported model. The findings of this paper are especially relevant for managers of product-focused firms who seek guidance in evolving their business models into solution providers. The paper also contributes to business model research by linking extant insights from network research to open business model performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Our hypothesis testing and bootstrap resampling show that when a diary keeper initiates a contact, weak ties result in more gains. In contrast, when the other party starts the contact, it is strong rather than weak ties that turn out to be more beneficial to the diary keeper. Such effects vary by other contextual factors, however, particularly the purposes of contacts. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that our proposed definition better reflects theorized effects of the important third tie in the social network literature. We also develop new methods for estimating triplet, local and global clustering.

In doing so, we also test the effects of these variables on improved adaptive behavior. Our results show high positive correlation between social connectedness for team members and coordination quality and also adaptive behavior.

Yet new advances in measures and methods related to bipartite networks in the fields of sociology, physics, and biology may make such tactics unnecessary.

For nearly thirty years, social network researchers have argued that the network is composed of ego's closest or most important alters. This assumption, however, has not been tested empirically. Using original data on an online representative quota survey of 2000 respondents, I find that 45% of the core discussion network is composed of people whom respondents do not consider important to them. In fact, the core discussion network includes doctors, co-workers, spiritual leaders, and other alters whom ego confides in without feeling emotionally attached to. I examine what respondents consider important matters and why they approach weak ties to discuss these. Placing emphasis on the process through which ego mobilizes alters, I develop two theoretical perspectives, which focus on how people identify those appropriate to a topic and how they respond to opportunities in interactional contexts. Findings suggest that ego discusses important matters with non-close alters at times because they are known to be knowledgeable (targeted mobilization) and at times because they are available when important issues arise (opportune mobilization). Results suggest that recent findings about changes in the core discussion network of Americans are consistent with several different possibilities about the nature of strong ties, including those in which there has been no change at all.

We focus on nonredundancy in their networks and on the influence of the strength of ties to nonredundant contacts in both business and private aspects.

The networks of women in abusive relationships were smaller in size, but more efficient in their ability to reach their members, than those of nonabused women. Proportionally, networks of abused women had more women but fewer in-laws than those of comparison women. The women in these abusive relationships had higher measures of centrality, suggesting that they were more critical in holding their networks together. Yet, they had fewer social contacts, and provided more support than they received with fewer reciprocated ties.

Yet, the scope and mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unclear. I propose a general theoretical framework that initially takes the stand-alone favor, rather than reciprocity, as a mode of economic allocation and identifies its institutional support structures. Markets and hierarchies shape favor-doing alongside social networks, often as a byproduct of their other functions. I find empirical evidence for social networks and market pricing as support structures for favors in the Russian post-socialist labor market of the 1990s. The mechanisms behind social networks are prior history and the general norm of reciprocity, while market pricing induces favors by those employers positioned in the middle of the wage distribution and thus exhibiting simultaneously two qualities: a willingness to do favors, because the jobs they have to offer are not sufficiently lucrative to attract the very best talent, and an ability to ask for favors, because nevertheless those jobs remain attractive enough for job seekers at large. Overall, this study shows how labor market institutions, originally set up to support competitive exchanges, affect the likelihood of favors in hiring, in tandem with the traditional support structure, social networks. Favor-doing in emerging markets is understood better as a broadly conceived institutionalized process having a variety of support structures, not just networks, that must be explored from the bottom up in each specific setting.",2013"Perkins, Molly M.; Ball, Mary M.; Kemp, Candace L.; Hollingsworth, Carole",Social Relations and Resident Health in Assisted Living: An Application of the Convoy Model,GERONTOLOGIST,"Purpose: This article, based on analysis of data from a mixed methods study, builds on a growing. body of assisted living (AL) research focusing on the link between residents' social relationships and health.

In the second model, individuals interact with both strong and weak ties and decide how much time they spend with each of them. As in Granovetter, this model stresses the strength of weak ties in finding a job because they involve a secondary ring of acquaintances who have contacts with networks outside ego's network and therefore offer new sources of information on job opportunities.

To this end, it draws on the diffusion events of individual blog-posts in an online social community over a one-month period from 1 June to 30 June 2006. This study finds that an idea is likely to diffuse to remote contacts as the proportion of strong ties held by the source; that is, the idea originator, increases or as the social relations surrounding the source become dense.

At present, there are a wide variety of alternatives for managing quality in organisations, such as ISO standards and the European Foundation for Quality Management model. Thus, different alternatives will influence the external social networks differently, affecting strategic flexibility and organisational learning, as the literature on external social networks suggests that they can affect strategic flexibility and organisational learning positively. Through a comparative analysis of variance and stepwise regressions, we observed that external social networks affect strategic flexibility and organisational learning positively, primarily based on the greater size of the networks. On the other hand, we found that depending on the kind of QM initiative implemented in the organisation, other effects vary. For example, in organisations without QM, the range of external social networks influences strategic flexibility negatively, whereas in organisations with ISO standards, this negative effect disappears. In organisations with TQM, we found the positive effect of both size and strength of relations on the networks. For organisational learning, a negative relationship was found between organisational capability and network range for the non-QM firm group. These relationships turned out to be positive for the TQM firm group.

As United States demographics shift and the nation continues to recognize the value of workplace diversity, engineering education stakeholders continue to seek ways to increase participation of women and minority students. Purpose Our research examines the following question: For Hispanic women whose parents have limited educational attainment, what available sources of potential social capital do they identify, and by what means do they access and activate these resources in their decisions to select and persist in engineering as a college major? We hope to provide insights for United States institutions that serve Hispanic students, as well as those seeking to diversify their student body. Design/method Utilizing Lin's network theory of social capital as a framework, we employed semi-structured interviews in a multiple case study research methodology, taking a constructivist epistemological view. Results Three major findings are that (1) lack of available family social capital was supplemented mostly by school personnel; (2) delayed recognition or identification of available resources slowed access and activation of resources, leading to difficult university transitions; and (3) if accessed and activated, peer groups and institutional support systems provided sources of social capital. Conclusions Even single instances or weak ties can be effective in bridging gaps in engineering-related social capital.

This paper aims to fill this gap by looking at social capital as propensity towards civicness and prosocial behaviour that facilitates the circulation of nonredundant knowledge among otherwise disconnected groups. The quantitative analysis of the innovative performance of Italian provinces shows that social capital proxied by blood donations and participation into voluntary associations is an important predictor of innovative performance after controlling for 'traditional' knowledge inputs (R&D and human capital). In addition, instrumental variable analysis makes it possible to identify clear causal links between social capital and innovation, suggesting that social norms play an important role in shaping the incentives for knowledge generation, circulation, and accumulation.",2013"Quinn, Kelly",WE HAVEN'T TALKED IN 30 YEARS!: Relationship reconnection and internet use at midlife,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,"The phenomenon of reconnection of dormant ties using internet communication technologies has been identified as having salience in the use of social media forms by midlife and older adults. Dormant ties, as distinguished from those that are merely inactive, are those that were once operational, but which have lapsed under the stressors of time, distance and circumstance, such as relationships between former college friends, neighbors or work colleagues. Reconnection is the process by which these dormant ties become active again, and is an activity which is supported in unique ways by internet communication technologies. This study presents findings from interviews with midlife adults on how the use of email, social network sites and search engines is leveraged to enhance and support the reconnection of dormant relationships and maintain weak ties. Grounded in a life course perspective, it examines how the experiences of longevity and the life course alter perceptions of the attributes and drawbacks that these technologies offer.

Little empirical research examines how these two types of variables are in fact related: how do extrinsic and intrinsic motivation explain the position that an employee entertains in a knowledge sharing network within an organization? Much is to be gained from a better understanding of how, empirically, psychological variables and an organization's network interrelate (Burt et al., 1998; Kalish and Robins, 2006; Moch, 1980; Teigland and Wasko, 2009). Still, this line of enquiry is not pursued much (Foss et al., 2009). This paper integrates the structural characteristics known to be implicated in knowledge transfer typically focused on in the social network literature on the one hand, with the motivational perspective commonly identified in the organization literature. This study examines how motivation - extrinsic (expected organizational rewards, reciprocal benefits) and intrinsic (knowledge self-efficacy, enjoyment in helping others) - might explain how employees may be better connected in the full knowledge transfer network or might be engaged more in inter-unit knowledge transfer. Connectedness (closeness centrality) and inter-unit ties are well-known to contribute to knowledge transfer. Analyzing data from a survey at two large European organizations, this study, counterintuitively, shows that neither intrinsic nor extrinsic motivation explain an individual's favorable position in a knowledge transfer network.

We develop hypotheses for three determinants of leadership: professional, networks, science ability, and gender. We test the resulting model on the likelihood of holding three different types of academic science leadership-research center leadership, university administrative leadership, and discipline leadership. Findings show that while science productivity and reputation are strongly associated with having either a center or discipline leadership position, they are less strongly associated with administrative leadership. Also, larger and more dense collaboration networks predict having a center leadership position, but the opposite is true for holding an administrative leadership position. Women are more likely to be in discipline leadership positions and less likely to be a leader of a research center or have an administrative university leadership position. Finally, having more women in the network reduces the likelihood of holding discipline or center leadership positions. Interpretations of findings and conclusions explore the potential implications for theory, practice and policy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We argue that strong ties to potentially influential organization members who are ambivalent about a change (fence-sitters) provide the change agent with an affective basis to coopt them. This cooptation increases the probability that the organization will adopt the change. By contrast, strong ties to potentially influential organization members who disapprove of a change outright (resistors) are an effective means of affective cooptation only when a change diverges little from institutionalized practices. With more divergent changes, the advantages of strong ties to resistors accruing to the change agent are weaker, and may turn into liabilities that reduce the likelihood of change adoption. Analyses of longitudinal data from 68 multimethod case studies of organizational change initiatives conducted at the National Health Service in the United Kingdom support these predictions and advance a relational view of organizational change in which social networks operate as tools of political influence through affective mechanisms.",2013"Kindler, Marta; Szulecka, Monika",The Economic Integration of Ukrainian and Vietnamese Migrant Women in the Polish Labour Market,JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES,"Through an analysis of Ukrainian and Vietnamese migrant women in Poland, we study the extent to which their economic integration is influenced by the legal frameworkfor example, the visa regimeand migrants' possession of, or access to, different forms of capital.

Diverse social connections in an IS project team,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT,"Although research has shown that knowledge sharing among project team members is crucial for project performance, achieving knowledge sharing is still challenging. This problem is especially salient in IS project teams. Such teams are temporary organizations that may not progress through the necessary team formation cycle, yet are expected to produce intangible outcomes in a limited time. In this paper, we investigate how bonding and bridging social capital influence knowledge sharing and project performance. Bonding could facilitate cohesiveness within a team and lead a team to achieve project goals. Bridging could facilitate access to various beneficial resources beyond the boundary of a project team, increasing creativity and innovation. However, bridging is costly and can obstruct project performance. Our findings suggest that team members with high bonding social capital are more likely to share their knowledge with their team. Bonding and intention to share knowledge also positively affect project performance. Conversely, bridging social capital can contribute to project performance only through the mediating effect of bonding. This research contributes to theory by empirically examining the two types of social capital and their interdependence, as predictors of knowledge sharing and subsequently project performance. Project managers should form teams composed of members with diverse social connections and consider the balance between bonding and bridging within a team to control the potential disadvantageous effects of bridging social capital.

Trade union strategies are captured under three analytical fields: spaces of transnational unionism, modes of interaction, and frames of reference. The paper's objective is to understand how national trade unions articulate the local and the global, and identify the factors that push and pull them into the transnational space. While trade unions in both countries have undergone a process of union renewal, their transnational strategy differs: Ghanaians are engaged in capacity building and Mexicans in coalition building. Strategies of transnational unionism are shaped by national contingencies. First, the Ghanaian trade union intervenes mainly at the African regional level through education and training programs for the rank and file, while the Mexican trade union is present at both the North-American regional and transnational levels, particularly through solidarity campaigns. Second, while Ghanaians maintain weak ties with other trade unions, the Mexicans are engaged in a wide repertoire of action with the North-American trade unions and international federations. Third, Ghanaians conceive their interests on the basis of a strong clan-based identity and see transnational unionism as a mean to increase their resources, while Mexicans build broader coalitions based upon class identity. In both cases, strategies of transnational unionism go beyond the dichotomy of the local and the global. They are socially constructed, locally embedded and are shaped by the dynamics of the political economy in which the trade unions are rooted and the supranational structures of opportunity available to them.",2013"Dahlander, Linus; McFarland, Daniel A.",Ties That Last: Tie Formation and Persistence in Research Collaborations over Time,ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY,"Using a longitudinal dataset of research collaborations over 15 years at Stanford University, we build a theory of intraorganizational task relationships that distinguishes the different factors associated with the formation and persistence of network ties. We highlight six factors: shared organizational foci, shared traits and interests, tie advantages from popularity, tie reinforcement from third parties, tie strength and multiplexity, and the instrumental returns from the products of ties. Findings suggest that ties form when unfamiliar people identify desirable and matching traits in potential partners. By contrast, ties persist when familiar people reflect on the quality of their relationship and shared experiences. The former calls for shallow, short-term strategies for assessing a broad array of potential ties; the latter calls for long-term strategies and substantive assessments of a relationship's worth so as to draw extended rewards from the association. This suggests that organizational activities geared toward sustaining persistent intraorganizational task relationships need to be different from activities aimed at forging new ones.",2013"Peter, Sascha; Drobnic, Sonja",Women and their memberships: Gender gap in relational dimension of social inequality,RESEARCH IN SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND MOBILITY,"Women tend to have fewer memberships in voluntary associations than men. Since voluntary associations create opportunity structures for the establishment of interpersonal contacts, memberships are considered to have beneficial ramifications by generating access to social resources. Using the European Social Survey 2002/2003, we examine variations in the gender gap in associational involvement in a cross-national context. We find systematic variation in the gender gap that cannot be explained solely by individual attributes. Using multilevel Poisson regression models and employing a gendered version of the theory of social origins of civil society (Salamon & Anheier, 1998), we find that women in the social democratic countries have the highest participation rates, followed by women in conservative and liberal regimes. In Mediterranean and post-socialist countries, women face a dual disadvantage. Their average number of voluntary association memberships is low, both in absolute terms and in comparison to their male counterparts. This study reveals a complex relationship between societal context and the gender gap in associational involvement. Inequality in voluntary association participation between the genders may be another piece in the jigsaw puzzle of overall gender inequality in contemporary societies.

I propose that cultural variety, as given by the number of cultural activities that the person engages in, is tied not only to static properties of social networks (such as range), but also to the likelihood of having benefited from this connectivity (social capital). Taking the classic example of finding a job via a network contact as the main outcome, I show that persons who have a propensity to engage in a wide variety of cultural activities have a higher likelihood of having found out about their current job via a weak tie and that different types of weak tie activation are selectively correlated with distinct cultural taste profiles.

Dissemination of such strategies, a necessary precursor to implementation, occurs through networks of relationships and can be facilitated by weak network ties, whereas implementation is associated with strong network ties. Purpose: To identify LHD characteristics associated with weak and strong ties in the national network of LHDs. Methods: Data on the structure and functions of participating LHDs (n=2107) were taken from the 2010 National Association of County and City Health Officials Profile of Local Health Departments (Profile Study). The 2010 Profile Study was the first to include a question on communication links across the national network of LHDs. Descriptive network analysis and exponential random graph modeling were used to identify LHD characteristics associated with weak and strong communication ties. Analysis was conducted in 2012. Results: The LHD network was relatively sparse overall, indicating that dissemination across the entire network would be difficult. Few strong nationwide ties were found, indicating a lack of structural influences encouraging implementation. Several LHD characteristics were associated with a higher likelihood of weak and strong ties. In bivariate analyses, larger health departments were more likely to have strong ties. Weak ties were more likely among LHDs sharing jurisdiction and organizational characteristics. The only network predictor of strong ties was being in the same state. Conclusions: Public health efforts aimed at broad dissemination and implementation of evidence-based programming may benefit from strengthening partnerships in each state. The largest jurisdictions within each state may be identified as partners in order to facilitate implementation, whereas identification of partners with differing levels of staffing, funding, and leadership is key to ensuring widespread dissemination across LHDs.

Building on Granovetter's idea that weak ties are superior to strong ties for providing support in getting a job, we develop a model in which workers who live far away from jobs choose to have less connections to weak ties. Because of the lack of good public transportation in the US, it is costly (both in terms of time and money) to commute to business centers to meet other types of people who can provide other source of information about jobs. If distant minority workers mainly rely on their strong ties, who are more likely to be unemployed, there is then little chance for them of escaping unemployment. It is therefore the separation in both the social and physical space that prevents ethnic minorities from finding a job. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Contrary to the notion that network positions are difficult to alter, I show that social media can induce a change in network structure, one from which individuals can derive economic benefits. In addition, I consider two intermediate mechanisms by which an informationrich network is theorized to improve work performance-information diversity and social communication-and quantify their effects on productivity and job security. Analysis shows that productivity, as measured by billable revenue, is more associated with information diversity than with social communication. However, the opposite is true for job security. Social communication is more correlated with reduced layoff risks than with information diversity.

We test our hypotheses using longitudinal KMS usage data on over 80,000 employees of a management consulting firm. Our approach infers the presence of identification and internalization from associations between actual system use behaviors by a focal individual and prior system use by a range of reference groups. Evidence of these kinds of associations between system use behaviors helps construct a more complete picture of social influence mechanisms, and is to our knowledge novel to the technology diffusion literature.

This study makes three theoretical predictions: (a) propensity to gossip online leads to greater information value, entertainment value, and friendship value; (b) upon exposure to a high-involvement product, online gossipers are more willing to spread such information through electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) in search of prestige or fame as a knowledge expert; and (c) this tendency will be more pronounced when they are connected with strong ties (rather than weak ties) and belong to a large network (rather than a small network).

A multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) provides empirical support for prediction (1). With regard to predictions (2) and (3), a series of three-way and two-way between-subjective ANOVAs were performed. When a high-involvement product is promoted, gossipers, rather than nongossipers, are more willing to participate in eWOM on an SNS. Furthermore, a significant interaction effect indicates that online gossipers' willingness to particiapte in eWOM would be more pronounced if they belonged to a large network rather than a small network.

Specific hypotheses on whether the importance of external personal networks varies for job positions, knowledge functions and sources of competitiveness are examined. The study is based on a survey and interviews with 105 R&D workers in 46 information technology (IT) firms in the Greater Cambridge Region (UK). The results show that alternative sources of knowledge are considerably more important than external personal networks. Specifically, the results confirm the hypothesis that the lower the job position, the less important are external personal networks. The most frequent type of knowledge that is uniquely available through personal networks concerns business knowledge of senior managers rather than technological knowledge. Furthermore, the analysis supports the view that external personal networks are most important for exploratory keeping up-to-date than for problem solving. Finally, the paper shows that external personal networks are more important for firms whose competitiveness is primarily driven by being cutting-edge in technology. Overall, the results suggest that academic theorising and R&D management/policy on external personal networks needs to be more context-sensitive and would benefit from differentiating between job positions, knowledge functions and types of firm competitiveness.

Due to commercialization, privatization and liberalization, the traditional role of German airport organizations as merely providers of infrastructure gives way to a more market-oriented understanding. Airport service quality and the ability to constantly innovate are important variables that contribute to overall airport attractiveness. Despite that airports are becoming increasingly aware of the need for customer-orientation, the majority of airports still suffer from a lack of genuine customer (passenger) insights. This due to the fact that airlines and tour operators own the passenger relationship and data. The emergence of public social software platforms (SSP), such as the online social network Facebook, is now enabling airport organizations to enter into a dialogue with the passenger and gain a deeper understanding of passenger needs while leveraging social capital. The research paper examines, if airports are able to increase their operational efficiency when entering into a collaborative communication with their customers on SSP. Design/methodology/approach. Based on a social capital / network approach to organizational work, the paper discusses the convergence of social and technological networks and the underlying motives of customers and organizations for joining social software platforms. Findings. The paper proposes a theoretical model to describe how a mutually beneficial relationship between organizations and customers on Facebook can help airports to reach economic goals. As a next step, the theoretical model will be operationalized and empirically tested in 2012 using qualitative and quantitative research. Originality/value. Social capital research as well as the adoption of SSP by organizations is still mainly scoped within organizational boundaries. The paper broadens the research focus to the focal actors organization and customer. From a practitioners' point of view, airport managers might find it useful to learn what organizational challenges arise when engaging with customers on social software platforms.",2013"Sliskovic, Tanja; Tipuric, Darko; Hruska, Domagoj",Understanding the Process of Managerial Entrenchment: The Role of Managerial Social Capital in Corporate Governance of a Post-Socialist Economy,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON MANAGEMENT LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE,"The aim of our qualitative study of managers in private and state owned companies is to understand how managers use their social capital to entrench themselves, taking into consideration different ownership structures of the companies they govern. We hold that the phenomenon of managerial entrenchment should be observed through social capital theory lens, looking into the type and nature of the relationship between the manager and the entity holding corporate. We identified mechanisms that influence the creation and mobilization of managers' social capital with regard to the specific context of the Croatian transition economy and the large stake of state-owned companies present in the Croatian business sector. The primary cause why managers dominantly entrench themselves through their social ties is the fact that Croatian economy is characterized with concentrated ownership and, thus, they have an easier time to create relationships with the shareholders. Secondly, because of the strong bond between the manager and the owner(s), managers strongly identify themselves with the company. We argue that, in the context of Croatian economy, managers don't necessarily work towards entrenching themselves as a strategic and conscious entrenchment act. That claim is in contrast with the majority of research on managerial entrenchment which implies the agency problem between managers and the entity holding corporate control, which makes our research results unorthodox, but pertinent to contemporary corporate governance literature.",2013"Ollington, Nickolas; Gibb, Jenny; Harcourt, Mark",Online social networks: an emergent recruiter tool for attracting and screening,PERSONNEL REVIEW,"Purpose - The increased popularity in using online social networks by recruiters has received much positive attention, particularly in the popular press.

Design/methodology/approach - The semi-structured interview approach is used to gather data from 25 recruitment specialists. Findings - The connector role is identified as a specific attraction mechanism recruiters use to create numerous weak ties, where some are so weak they barely constitute ties at all. The authors then identify branding, transparency and data specificity as three mechanisms recruiters use to strengthen these ties when performing the attracting and screening functions.

Although it has been investigated by a number of works lately, so far still little has been known about how people interact with each other in order to satisfy their information needs in social Q&A. With the aim to understand the patterns of user interactions in the social Q&A context, as well as factors that may affect such kind of back-and-forth communications, in this work we collect over 1,000 question and answering dialogues from Sina Weibo. Statistical analyses including ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, linear regression and independent t-test are performed in order to answer our proposed research questions. Our results demonstrate the importance of studying the interactions in social Q&A given that about half of our collected question-answer pairs are of interactive nature. From the quantity perspective, we observe that questions within more complicated topics, such as ""Healthcare"" and ""Education"" generate more interactions. Significantly positive correlation is also noticed between social tie strength and the number of interactions. By manually annotating all interactive answers, we also indicate the importance of weak ties in providing high quality answers and interactions.

This chapter discusses access to 'cultural resources' facilitated by digital media from a wide perspective (e. g. learning resources, health information, cultural events, employment opportunities, etc.). The purpose of the chapter is to reclaim the notion of 'cultural resources' for educational discourse as it seems powerful to us in the context of discussions about social mobility and fairness of access. Following a practical example which underscores the motivation of our discussion, key concepts are defined, particularly forms of 'capital' through the lens of the following question: how can we enable learning activities in formal and informal contexts undertaken by individuals and groups to become linked through scaffolding as a bridging activity mediated by network and mobile technology? As this is a large problem space, the literature is selectively reviewed in order to provide an overview of the current state of the art in terms of using network and mobile technology for bridging what we call 'social capital' (which emphasises the informational benefits of a heterogeneous network of weak ties).

However, not many studies investigate the factors that may help blog service providers to retain current bloggers from the perspectives of switching costs and social embeddedness. This study fills this gap and examines the antecedents of customer retention intention on the Wretch, a popular blog website in Taiwan. Three hundred and nine sets of valid data are gathered. Analytical results indicate that switching costs positively affect customer retention intention. Structural embeddedness of blogger-blogger and structural embeddedness of blogger-message positively affect switching costs. Relational embeddedness of blogger-blogger and relational embeddedness of blogger-message negatively affect switching costs. This study demonstrates that switching costs function as an important mediator between embeddedness and customer retention intention.

As knowledge becomes more and more specialized, intensive communication between researchers from various disciplines is required. Communication is a key factor for process coordination and organisational creativity. Although new channels of communication are now available, personal face-to-face meetings remain essential. Physical movement during work has been neglected in research and management: Physical movement not only influences cognitive performance, learning ability and individual creativity, it also affects the attitude to a task, work habits and the mood. It is a communication medium in and of itself. Triggered by the environment, it affects the characteristics of chance encounters, which in turn influences communication. This study is based on a single-case case study of a research team (n=27) of a multinational pharmaceutical company. It examines the communication patterns and the physical movement behaviour during communication of natural scientists before and after moving from a traditional cell space research and work environment into a modern multi-space building. This radically new work environment offers a wide range of open and closed workspaces as well as individual and communal work areas. The findings show that in an open multi-space work environment, the conversation lengths are immediately adjusted to the new environment, whereas the movement behaviour during conversation is adapted only after some time. Sitting during conversations has increased regarding the number of events whereas physical movement during conversations has decreased. In the multi-space work environment the lengths of communication events - distinguished by different behavioural patterns during communication - are timewise shorter than before the move. The duration of conversation while sitting has declined, it is now less than half as long as before the move. Previously they were by far the longest conversations.

We provide an integration of the current conceptualizations of social capital as they pertain to job performance outcomes by taking a multi-dimensional view of job performance. We break down job performance into creativity, decision-making, task execution, and teamwork, and distinguish the effect of structural holes within and across the organizational boundary on these four job performance domains. In an analysis of 318 managers, we find that networks rich in structural holes that cross the organizational boundary had a positive association with creativity and decision-making, whereas networks with few structural holes within the organization had a positive association with task execution and teamwork. We discuss the theoretical implications for integrating the social capital, boundary spanning, and network structure literatures, as well as the practical benefits of giving much more precise advice to managers and employees regarding how to use networks to improve performance at work.

In this context, similarity-based algorithms have become the mainstream. However, most of them take into account the contributions of each common neighbor equally to the connection likelihood of two nodes. This paper proposes a model for link prediction, which is based on the node centrality of common neighbors. Three node centralities are discussed: degree, closeness and betweenness centrality. In our model, each common neighbor plays a different role to the node connection likelihood according to their centralities. Moreover, the weak-tie theory is considered for improving the prediction accuracy. Finally, extensive experiments on five real-world networks show that the proposed model can outperform the Common Neighbor (CN) algorithm and gives competitively good prediction of or even better than Adamic-Adar (AA) index and Resource Allocation (RA) index.

The findings support the importance of maintaining instrumental (a technical/rational argument) rather than homophilous ties for acquisition of evidence-based practice knowledge.

The amount of work dedicated to studying information diffusion in OSNs has increased in recent years. Past research has clearly shown that diffusion of information in social networks depends on both the nature of the information and the structure of the network. In this study, we focus on one of the structural properties, tie strength, in the flow of information through social networks. Several studies have shown that weak ties can act as bridges, linking disconnected groups in the network, which, in turn, allows information to diffuse between subgroups. However, not all weak ties are ""good"" weak ties in the network. In this study, we want to prove that a weak tie helps in the spread of information, when a ""good"" weak tie is selected.

However, from a practical perspective, the case that individual whether or not be infected by the neighbor spreader greatly depends on the trustiness of ties between them. In order to solve this problem, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model of the rumor diffusion, in which the infectious probability is defined as a function of the strength of ties. Moreover, we investigate numerically the behavior of the model on a real scale-free social site with the exponent gamma = 2.2. We verify that the strength of ties plays a critical role in the rumor diffusion process. Specially, selecting weak ties preferentially cannot make rumor spread faster and wider, but the efficiency of diffusion will be greatly affected after removing them. Another significant finding is that the maximum number of spreaders max(S) is very sensitive to the immune probability mu and the decay probability nu. We show that a smaller mu or nu leads to a larger spreading of the rumor, and their relationships can be described as the function ln(max(S)) = Av + B, in which the intercept B and the slope A can be fitted perfectly as power-law functions of mu.

Design/methodology/approach - With a grounded theory approach, this research begins with an exploratory study of the page maintained by a large retailer for six months, followed by a qualitative study featuring in-depth individual interviews and focus groups with 26 members of the CSN. Findings - The results highlight differences between CSNs and other types of online communities (OCs). Members rely on the company to help them achieve their goals; few count on their CSN peers, with whom they maintain weak ties. Unlike in brand communities (BCs), most members are not enthusiasts but instead engage in a pragmatic relationship with the brand. Practical implications - CSNs can create value for both the host company and its members; active management is necessary to unlock that potential. The implications for CSN management include strategies to foster participation and increase value for companies and members. Originality/value - Although the previous research has studied OCs, specific research on CSNs is scarce. This study characterizes CSNs and provides details regarding participation factors in this new context, as well as relevant implications for CSN management and service research.",2013"Li, Wan; Veliyath, Rajaram; Tan, Justin",Network Characteristics and Firm Performance: An Examination of the Relationships in the Context of a Cluster,JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT,"The study examined the impact of spatial relationships on firm performance.

The sample comprised 252 firms located in a mold industry cluster in the Zhejiang province of China. Both in-cluster ties and extra-cluster ties positively impacted performance. However, the effects of distant ties were more pronounced. Tie stability had a positive effect whereas tie quality had a negative effect on performance. Network centrality, tie strength, and tie stability strengthened the relationship between in-cluster ties and performance. By contrast, all network tie characteristics weakened and changed the form of the relationship between extra-cluster ties and performance. The findings suggest the need for cluster firms to consciously cultivate distant linkages in their network ties in order to neutralize the tendencies for lock-in and to arrest entropic deterioration in their respective clusters.",2013"McDonald, Steve; Gaddis, S.

During the mentoring periods accelerator management is actively involved with the portfolio firms and provides extensive networking support. The 2012 publication U.S. Seed Accelerator Rankings identified 71 U.S. accelerators and noted that their numbers are growing rapidly. In the U.S. alone it is estimated that more than 1,400 start-up companies are mentored annually by such firms. Accelerators are also growing rapidly and have become critical nodes in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Understanding relative accelerator performance and the characteristics driving superior performance can have a multiplier effect on overall start-up success. To that end, we consider two research questions in this paper: Do top-ranked accelerator portfolio firms display similar survival rates? And, what accelerator characteristics correlate with variations in portfolio firm survival? Network theory informs the hypotheses investigated in this study. In this study we compare the survival performance of accelerator portfolio firms in Silicon Valley and Ireland to those of other leading geographically dispersed accelerators. An analysis of the node characteristics in these ecosystems suggests that Silicon Valley portfolio firms will experience higher failure rates and Irish accelerator portfolio firms will experience lower failure rates then other regions. In contrast, network theory also suggests that hubs, such as accelerators, can help embed nodes, such as start-ups, in preferred networks and that such networking can enhance firm outcomes, such as survival. Network theory also suggests that establishing network ties comes at a cost, and that accelerator and start-up resources must be adequate to enable useful network connections. Smaller cohort sizes and larger capital investments are evaluated to determine if the additional resources resulting from these practices benefit firm survival. The resulting hypotheses are evaluated via t-tests and regression analyses on data from the portfolio firms of 18 top-ranked accelerators. Our results suggest that Irish accelerator portfolio firms experience lower failure rates than portfolio firms from other regions. Interestingly these results demonstrated only modest absolute differences in regional outcomes despite significant differences in the outcome objectives of the regional funding sources in Silicon Valley and Ireland which were considered in detail. Variation in accelerator practice on funding levels and cohort size were not found to significantly impact firm outcomes although accelerator experience was found to be significant to portfolio firm survival.",2013"Riverola, Carla; Miralles, Francesc",Understanding Entrepreneurial Performance in a Networked Social Environment,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP, VOL 2","Several theories have been trying to identify the entrepreneur's success factors in order to improve new venture performance (Simpeh 2011). From a managerial point of view, the Resource-Based Theory considers that the founder's access to resources is an important mean for entrepreneurial performance (Bordieu 1983; Alvarez and Busenitz, 2001). Build under the Resource-Based Theory, the social capital of the entrepreneur studies how the individual's social network may provide external resources (such as knowledge, skills, capital, information...) to enhance its venture performance (Bordieu 1983; Aldrich and Zimmers 1986; Coleman 1990; Lee and Jones 2010). Concretely, strong ties (such as family or friends) are good for accessing finance and other resources (Lowik et al 2012); whereas weak ties are good for accessing information about structural holes and generating creative ideas (Burt 1992, 2004; Shane and Venkataraman 2000). It then seems clear that when increasing the entrepreneur's social capital, its performance should increase. Contrarily, some researchers identified that entrepreneurs working in a networked social environment - where they have more opportunities to develop and maintain ties through new IT - are having difficulties to identify structural holes (Teece 2009). Moreover, studies found that entrepreneurs may be fortifying the embeddedness of their social network rather than building on their weak ties (Newbert and Tornikoski 2012). In this sense, we hypothesize that the new ways of communicating are driving entrepreneurs to build embeddedness within their strong ties; leaving unattended the importance of developing weak ties to identify structural holes. This research work aims to approach this existing gap through identifying how the entrepreneur's strong and weak ties have been affected by this networked social environment, and what's the specific effect on entrepreneurial performance. Therefore, the contribution of this research may be for both academics and practitioners; through providing an accurate perspective of the entrepreneur's social capital on entrepreneurial performance.",2013"Wessner, Daniel",Inverted Humanitarian Service and Learning: The CSI Haitian Pilot Examined in Doodles and Parables,PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRD 2013 IEEE GLOBAL HUMANITARIAN TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE (GHTC 2013),"While engineers are eminently qualified as logical, mathematical, and precise problem-solvers who work creatively with energy, soil, water, metallurgy, and chemical elements, they often slam into illogical walls. diverse cultural, political, linguistic, psychological stress, and economic contexts way beyond their professional training and practice.

Demographic and social characteristics are used to explain differences in local preparedness. Communities were chosen to represent three historical regions with different levels of bonding and bridging social capital. The results indicate the importance of strong ties (bonding social capital) in local flood preparedness and participatory risk management.

Most of prior studies adopt patent citation data to indicate the traces of knowledge flows. However, patent citation is a noisy indicator in reflecting technology diffusion and has limitation in identifying knowledge flows induced by personal contacts. In this paper. we propose a method for the construction of international knowledge spillover networks by incorporating patent citations with co-inventors information so as to detect the change of network structure induced by social ties of co-inventors and reflect both explicit and tacit knowledge diffusions across national frontiers. We apply the proposed method to a sample of power system related patents granted to Chinese assignees by USPTO during 2000-2007. Our results confirm that patent citation is not an adequate indicator of knowledge flows since it reflects very few knowledge exchanging channel. However, co-invented relationships which provide trace of tacit knowledge flows can complement the patent citation data to produce a fuller picture of international knowledge spillover. The incorporation of co-inventors data helps produce a Sino-American spillover network with a structure changed from extremely loose to loosely-tied in whole but cohesive locally. The cohesive subgroups contribute much to knowledge spillover from U.S. to China and dissipate internally among Chinese firms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Based on the contact process, we study numerically how weak ties influence the predictability of epidemic dynamics. We first investigate the effects of the degree of bridge nodes on the variabilities of both the arrival time and the prevalence of disease, and find out that the bridge node with a small degree can enhance the predictability of epidemic spreading. Once weak ties are settled, the variability of the prevalence will display a complete opposite trend to that of the arrival time, as the distance from the initial seed to the bridge node or the degree of the initial seed increases. More specifically, the further distance and the larger degree of the initial seed can induce the better predictability of the arrival time and the worse predictability of the prevalence. Moreover, we discuss the effects of the number of weak ties on the epidemic variability. As the community strength becomes very strong, which is caused by the decrease of the number of weak ties, the epidemic variability will change dramatically. Compared with the case of the hub seed and the random seed, the bridge seed can result in the worst predictability of the arrival time and the best predictability of the prevalence.

The results indicated that three factors that relate to three dimensions of social capital in the VC - familiarity with members in the VC from the structural dimension, perceived similarity with other members from the cognitive dimension, and trust in other members from the relational dimension - are all positively related to the sense of belonging, which affects intentions to get and share knowledge and mediates the relationships between social capital factors and a VC member's intentions to participate.

Further, while a majority of the journals in the STS network are connected by weak ties, about half of the history of science network consists of strong ties. The history of science network is thus more cohesive than the STS network. The relatively strong cohesion within the history of science network is associated with comparatively high degrees of intra-disciplinary communication, but comparatively weak ties to only a few related disciplines.

Combining field data from a global Consulting firm with an agent-based model, we examine how efforts to supplement one's knowledge from coworkers interact with individual, organizational, and environmental characteristics to impact organizational performance. We find that once cost and interpersonal exchange are included in the analysis, the impact of knowledge transfer is highly contingent. Depending on specific characteristics and circumstances, knowledge transfer can better, matter little to, or even harm performance. Three illustrative studies clarify puzzling past results and offer specific boundary conditions: (1) At the individual level, better organizational support for employee learning diminishes the benefit of knowledge transfer for organizational performance. (2) At the organization level, broader access to organizational memory makes global knowledge transfer less beneficial to performance. (3) When the organizational environment becomes more turbulent, the organizational performance benefits of knowledge transfer decrease. The findings imply that organizations may forgo investments in both organizational memory and knowledge exchange, that wide-ranging knowledge exchange may be unimportant or even harmful for performance, and that organizations operating in turbulent environments may find that investment in knowledge exchange undermines performance rather than enhances it. At a time when practitioners are urged to make investments in facilitating knowledge transfer and collaboration, appreciation of the complex relationship between knowledge transfer and performance will help in reaping benefits while avoiding liabilities.",2012"Daly, Alan J.","Data, Dyads, and Dynamics: Exploring Data Use and Social Networks in Educational Improvement",TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD,"Background: In the past decade, there has been an increasing national policy push for educators to systematically collect, interpret, and use data for instructional decision making. The assumption by the federal government is that having data systems will be enough to prompt the use of data for a wide range of decision making. These policies rely on inducements to inspire local level changes; however, they leave the processes related to data use largely undefined. Objective: In this article, I argue that many of the studies on data use either invoke or directly assess network-related concepts and, as such, network theory and analysis provides a useful analytic and complementary framework and methods for examining the social infrastructure in the use of data for educational improvement. Research Design: This article reports on a literature review of the data use and social network literatures and the utility of intersecting both literatures for studies on data use for educational improvement. Conclusions: Many data use studies report that the interpretation and use of data takes place both within and between individuals who, through social interaction, are both co-constructing and making sense of data and their use. Given the increasing role of social relationships in data use studies better theorizing and understanding the dynamics of social influence and processes on the interpretation and use of data is needed.

Our results are based on the analysis of a full calendar year of data for 22,696 mobile phone users (53.2 million call logs) in Lisbon, Portugal. The results suggest that different weather parameters have correlations to the level and character of social interactions. We found that although weather did not show much influence upon people's average call duration, the likelihood of longer calls was found to increase during periods of colder weather. During periods of weather that were generally considered to be uncomfortable (i.e., very cold/warm, very low/high air pressure, and windy), people were found to be more likely to communicate with fewer social ties. Despite this tendency, we found that people are more likely to maintain their connections with those they have strong ties with much more than those of weak ties.

Settlement in the deconcentrated spaces that currently constitute the new urban spaces of U.S. metropolitan areas potentially offers more opportunities to interact with ethnically diverse people than the traditional ethnic enclaves of inner cities. However, these spatial structures also increase dependency on cars and road systems. Findings from ethnographic fieldwork in Orange County, California, show that the social networks of affluent first generation immigrants from Taiwan are not comparable to the densely knit broadly based ties linking neighbors and kin group members traditionally attributed to immigrants. Instead, the social networks of immigrants with high levels of human and economic capital are based on loosely bounded, sparsely knit, and dynamic specialized ties. At the local level networks involve few ties to extended relatives, but a substantial amount of relationships with former classmates and members of recreational associations. However, despite good English skills and employment in diverse workplaces the number of interactions with nonimmigrants outside of work and school environments is rather small. These circumstances are experienced differently by men and women. Female immigrants consider living in the deconcentrated spaces of master-plan communities beneficial for achieving personal contentment. They welcome the changed conditions for social interaction and enjoy the decrease in network size and frequency of contacts that result in less obligations and responsibilities compared to life back in their country of origin. Male immigrants, however, mourn the loss of opportunities to gain reputation and social recognition. They would prefer to live in areas with close spatial proximity of immigrant residences.

Over the last decade, the concept of adaptive governance has rapidly gained prominence in the scientific community as a new alternative to the traditional predict-and-control regime. However, many policy makers and practitioners are struggling to apply adaptive governance in practice. Drawing on an extensive, critical literature review of adaptive governance, network management and institutional analysis, we argue that the constraints to the uptake of adaptive governance relate to a large extent to the inability of practitioners and policy makers to cope with complexity and various uncertainties: (i) ambiguous purposes and objectives of what should be achieved with governance; (ii) unclear contextual conditions in which governance takes place; and, (iii) uncertainty around the effectiveness of different governance strategies. To address such practical challenges, this paper introduces a ""fit-for-purpose"" framework consisting of three key ingredients for developing a diagnostic approach for making adaptive governance operational. We introduce the concept of fit-for-purpose governance to be used as an indication of the effectiveness of governance structures and processes and define it as a measure of the adequacy of the functional purposes that governance structures and processes have to fulfil at a certain point in time. In other words, are existing and proposed governance structures and processes fit for their purpose? While adaptive governance focuses on responding to (potential) change, fit-for-purpose governance is specifically considering the (future) functions that the social and physical components of a particular system, such as an urban water system, have to fulfil. As such, the fit-for-purpose governance framework provides an alternative starting point for developing the much sought-after guidance for policy and decision makers to evaluate the effectiveness of established governance arrangements and to predict the likelihood of success of institutional reform.

While prior studies tended to favor higher network centrality (i.e., larger volume of network ties), in this study, the researchers argue that centrality can reduce communication efficiency if the diversity of the ties is low. Research question: Which characteristic of communication ties, volume or diversity, has more influence on knowledge workers' performance? Literature review: Using social network analysis (SNA) as the theoretical framework, a review of the literature shows that social network ties have important performance implications because they can enhance an individual's access to valued resources. Studies have also examined the performance impact of ""hindrance network centrality,"" or how frequently a person is described by other network members as a hindrance to their performance. However, current research has overlooked the possible negative communication consequences of centrality in regards to redundant information, which may negatively affect job performance. Methodology: The current study employs a quantitative approach, using the standard SNA method of a ""name generator"" questionnaire to collect network data. Participants were 98 people in the IT department at a large defense company. We identified 3905 relationships and analyzed them with the UCINET software. Subsequently, social network variables, as well as performance and human capital variables were analyzed in logistic regressions. Results and discussion: Results showed a significant relationship between constraint, a measure of tie diversity, and performance. Centrality, the measure of tie volume, however, was not significantly related to performance. Our findings about the volume versus diversity of communication ties have important implications for professional communicators in the age of fast-growing social network media.

Empirical studies through this model on various real-world online social network data sets reveal three interesting findings. First, it is the adoption of the information pushing mechanism that greatly facilitates the information propagation in OSNs. Second, some global but cost-intensive strategies, such as selecting the ties of higher betweenness centralities for information propagation, no longer have significant advantages. Third, the random selection strategy is more efficient than selecting the strong ties for information propagation in OSNs. Along this line, we provide further explanations by categorizing weak ties into positive and negative ones and reveal the special bridge effect of positive weak ties.

Due to developments in IT, new collective human behavior, new dimensions of data sources are beginning to open up. Here we report on a complete data set of an entire society, consisting of over 350,000 human players of a massive multiplayer online game. All actions of all players over three years are recorded, including communication behavior and social ties. In this work we review the first steps undertaken in analyzing this vast data set, focusing on social dynamics on friend-, enemy-and communication networks. This new data-driven approach to social science allows to study socio-economic behavior of humans and human groups in specific environments with unprecedented precision. We propose two new empirical social laws which relate the network properties of link weight, overlap and betweenness centrality in a nonlinear way, and provide strong quantitative evidence for classical social balance assumptions, the weak ties hypothesis and triadic closure.

Most of the available algorithms are based on the assumption that dense subgraphs correspond to complexes, failing to take into account the inherence organization within protein complex and the roles of edges. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the possibility of discovering protein complexes using the topological information hidden in edges. Results: To provide an investigation of the roles of edges in PPI networks, we show that the edges connecting less similar vertices in topology are more significant in maintaining the global connectivity, indicating the weak ties phenomenon in PPI networks. We further demonstrate that there is a negative relation between the weak tie strength and the topological similarity. By using the bridges, a reliable virtual network is constructed, in which each maximal clique corresponds to the core of a complex. By this notion, the detection of the protein complexes is transformed into a classic all-clique problem. A novel core-attachment based method is developed, which detects the cores and attachments, respectively. A comprehensive comparison among the existing algorithms and our algorithm has been made by comparing the predicted complexes against benchmark complexes. Conclusions: We proved that the weak tie effect exists in the PPI network and demonstrated that the density is insufficient to characterize the topological structure of protein complexes. Furthermore, the experimental results on the yeast PPI network show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. The analysis of detected modules by the present algorithm suggests that most of these modules have well biological significance in context of complexes, suggesting that the roles of edges are critical in discovering protein complexes.",2012"Dunbar, R.

These bonded relationships, which provide the basis for coalitions, are underpinned by an endorphin mechanism mediated by social grooming. However, bonded relationships of this kind impose constraints on the size of social groups that are possible. When ecological pressures have demanded larger groups, primates have had to evolve new mechanisms to facilitate bonding. This has involved increasing the size of vocal and visual communication repertoires, increasing the time devoted to social interaction and developing a capacity to manage two-tier social relationships ( strong and weak ties). I consider the implications of these constraints for the evolution of human social communities and argue that laughter was an early evolutionary innovation that helped bridge the bonding gap between the group sizes characteristic of chimpanzees and australopithecines and those in later hominins.",2012"Eklinder-Frick, Jens; Eriksson, Lars Torsten; Hallen, Lars",Effects of social capital on processes in a regional strategic network,INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT,"Understanding the role of social capital is vital for implementing cluster policies as regional strategic networks and cluster initiatives are influenced by the local socio-economic context and its social capital.

Archival and survey data were obtained from 294 small-business organizations, with survey responses obtained from both the small-business leader and an HR consultant assigned to the small business. Findings suggest that leader perceptions of HR effectiveness are positively related to the use of HPWSs and that this relationship is moderated both by the communication patterns between the small-business leader and the HR consultant assigned to the firm and the small-business leader's HR knowledge.

We hypothesized that part of the problem may lie in how we conceptualize the integration process and the complex systems within which integrated care is enacted. This study aims to contribute to discourse regarding the relevance and utility of a complex-adaptive systems (CAS) perspective on integrated care. Methods: In the Canadian province of Ontario, government mandated the development of fourteen Local Health Integration Networks in 2006. Against the backdrop of these efforts to integrate care, we collected focus group data from a diverse sample of healthcare professionals in the Greater Toronto Area using convenience and snowball sampling. A semi-structured interview guide was used to elicit participant views and experiences of health systems integration. We use a CAS framework to describe and analyze the data, and to assess the theoretical fit of a CAS perspective with the dominant themes in participant responses. Results: Our findings indicate that integration is challenged by system complexity, weak ties and poor alignment among professionals and organizations, a lack of funding incentives to support collaborative work, and a bureaucratic environment based on a command and control approach to management. Using a CAS framework, we identified several characteristics of CAS in our data, including diverse, interdependent and semi-autonomous actors; embedded co-evolutionary systems; emergent behaviours and non-linearity; and self-organizing capacity. Discussion and conclusion: One possible explanation for the lack of systems change towards integration is that we have failed to treat the healthcare system as complex-adaptive. The data suggest that future integration initiatives must be anchored in a CAS perspective, and focus on building the system's capacity to self-organize. We conclude that integrating care requires policies and management practices that promote system awareness, relationship-building and information-sharing, and that recognize change as an evolving learning process rather than a series of programmatic steps.",2012"Michailova, Snejina; Mustaffa, Zaidah","Subsidiary knowledge flows in multinational corporations: Research accomplishments, gaps, and opportunities",JOURNAL OF WORLD BUSINESS,"Research on knowledge flows in multinational corporations has grown considerably over the last 15 years or so.

Here, we use the concept of social innovation, which is relatively new in innovation research, to explain the mechanisms that facilitate educational reform, and emphasise the relationship between interaction and the perception of change.

In terms of their travel scope, people are geographically closer to their weak ties than strong ties. Specifically, they are 15% more likely to be at some distance away from their weak ties than strong ties. The likelihood of being at some distance from social ties increases with the population density, and the rates of increase are higher for shorter geo-social radii. In addition, we find that area population density is indicative of geo-social radius where denser areas imply shorter radii.

Hence, knowledge management (KM) has been extensively researched. Prior knowledge management research has recognized the importance of making individual knowledge available throughout the organization. Most KM research, however, has thus far focused on a technology-based KM strategy with relatively little discussion on how knowledge can be effectively shared using organizational social relationships. This paper focuses on how knowledge-intensive organizations can design and use ""knowledge flow networks (KFNs)"" in order to facilitate knowledge sharing. Designing and using KFNs to maximize knowledge sharing is a complex problem. We formulate a mixed integer programming model (MIP), and present a heuristic in order to facilitate systematic analysis and understanding of effective KFNs. We consider organizations that support multiple skills and have workers with varying levels of competence who are connected through IT-facilitated organizational social relationships. Our results, based on computational experiments, provide several interesting insights and intelligence into the design of an effective KFN. First, our results highlight that average workers play a vital bridging role in knowledge sharing. Second, social networking concepts of ties and cohesiveness are used to better understand the dynamics of knowledge sharing. The importance of indirect relationships between expert workers and the network effects due to indirect relationships are illustrated. For effective KM, we also illustrate how organizations can reduce the total number of ties required in a multi-skill environment. In our model extensions, we study the impact of worker turnover and knowledge depreciation on the design and use of effective KFNs. Managerial implications of these results are discussed. The model and solution procedure proposed in this paper can serve as a managerial benchmarking framework for effective management of KFNs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Consistent with the ""strength of weak ties"" argument, larger online networks and weak-tie discussion frequency are associated with online participation.

We contribute to the literature by showing that in the MNC context, cultural and functional similarity can become more powerful sources of bias than more commonly assumed demographic characteristics such as gender or seniority. This may be driven by the salience of such boundaries in the MNC: while demographic characteristics are more broadly distributed, cultural and functional barriers create more defined and observable faultlines, often coinciding with unit boundaries. We further argue that it may not be similarity as such that matters but rather its positive impact on different dimensions of social capital, which mediate the relationship between similarity and knowledge sharing.

Our model relies on a pairwise Hamiltonian for decision-maker interactions which naturally extends the multi-populations approaches by shifting and biasing the pattern definitions of a Hopfield model of neural networks. Once introduced, the model is investigated through graph theory (to recover Granovetter and Watts-Strogatz results) and statistical mechanics (to recover Mac-Fadden and Brock-Durlauf results). Due to the internal symmetries of our model, the latter is obtained as the relaxation of a proper Markov process, allowing even to study its out-of-equilibrium properties. The method used to solve its equilibrium is an adaptation of the Hamilton-Jacobi technique recently introduced by Guerra in the spin-glass scenario and the picture obtained is the following: shifting the patterns from [-1,+1] -> [0. + 1] implies that the larger the amount of similarities among decision makers, the stronger their relative influence, and this is enough to explain both the different role of strong and weak ties in the social network as well as its small-world properties. As a result, imitative interaction strengths seem essentially a robust request (enough to break the gauge symmetry in the couplings), furthermore, this naturally leads to a discrete choice modelization when dealing with the external influences and to imitative behavior a la Curie-Weiss as the one introduced by Brock and Durlauf.

METHODS: We surveyed representatives from agencies that serve children with CCCs in Forsyth County, North Carolina, about their agencies' existing and desired collaborations with other agencies in the network. We used Social Network Analytical (SNA) methods to describe gaps in the network. Mean out-degree and in-degree centrality (number of collaborative ties extending from or directed toward an agency) and density (ratio of extant ties to all possible ties) were measured. RESULTS: In this network with 3658 possible collaborative ties, care-coordination agencies and pediatric practices reported the highest existing collaborations with other agencies (out-degree centrality: 32 and 30, respectively). Pediatric practices reported strong ties with subspecialty clinics (density: 73%), but weak ties with family support services (density: 3%).

Each layer increases relationship numbers by an approximate multiple of 3 (515-50150) but decreasing levels of intimacy (strong, medium, and weak ties) and frequency of interaction. To account for these regularities, we draw on both social and evolutionary psychology to argue that relationships at different layers serve different functions and have different cost-benefit profiles. At each layer, the benefits are asymptotic but the costs of maintaining a relationship at that level (most obviously, the time that has to be invested in servicing it) are roughly linear with the number of relationships. The trade-off between costs and benefits at a given level, and across the different types of demands and resources typical of different levels, gives rise to a distribution of social effort that generates and maintains a hierarchy of layered sets of relationships within social networks. We suggest that, psychologically, these trade-offs are related to the level of trust in a relationship, and that this is itself a function of the time invested in the relationship.",2012"Marin, Alexandra","Don't mention it: Why people don't share job information, when they do, and why it matters",SOCIAL NETWORKS,"Network-based job search is especially likely to foster workplace segregation and limit status attainment when information flows through homophilous ties. This paper takes the perspective of information holders and examines how the use of strong versus weak ties - which tend to be homophilous and heterophilous, respectively - differs with characteristics of labour markets in which jobs are located. Using in-depth interviews with entry-level white collar workers I show that information holders with opportunities to mention specific jobs to specific people do so only 27% of the time. Because they hesitate to share information if they are uncertain the information is specifically sought, information flows more commonly to strong ties, whose career goals are more likely to be known. Information is more likely to be shared with weak ties if it concerns occupations for which one may be specifically credentialed, since receiving relevant training serves as signal of interest in such jobs. These finding suggest that the homophily of referrals and their inequality-generating effects may vary across occupations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To resolve this confusion, we need to theorize how specific characteristics of ties are related to the mechanisms that make job search through contacts effective. We have reasons to expect that, while a contact's motivation influences the likelihood that a job seeker receives an offer, her homophily with the job seeker on occupation and other job-relevant attributes influences the quality of the offer. The use of strong ties among university students to find jobs in China provides a unique opportunity to empirically isolate the relationship between contact characteristics and the mechanisms through which contacts benefit the job seeker. I tested my hypotheses with data on both the successful and unsuccessful job searches of 478 graduates of China's flagship universities, who, as first-time job seekers, primarily used strong ties. Survey results are consistent with my hypotheses: job seekers who used strong ties to look for jobs had more offers-but not better offers-than those who used only formal methods.

This paper particularly focuses on a key concept of social network analysis (SNA), the concept of tie strength, in an inter-organisational knowledge transfer context. Tie strength describes the strength of a social relationship. In the past, SNA literature with a knowledge management context has often emphasized the importance of strong and/or weak ties rather than of intermediate (medium strong) ties in a social network. Nevertheless, in this study, intermediate ties are identified as the dominant links among key groups of organisation in a social network. Intermediate ties also help connect otherwise weakly linked organisations. Moreover, a definition of intermediate ties in the context of knowledge management is introduced. With the help of cluster analysis and an investigation into the levels of reciprocity, intermediate ties can be clearly defined in a social network. Due to their importance for knowledge transfer in a social network, intermediate ties should be primarily supported, for example by appropriate ICT.",2012"Lowik, Sandor; van Rossum, Daan; Kraaijenbrink, Jeroen; Groen, Aard",Strong Ties as Sources of New Knowledge: How Small Firms Innovate through Bridging Capabilities,JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT,"While extant literature assumes an inverted U-shaped relationship between tie-strength and new knowledge acquisition, our study suggests a positive, curvilinear relationship.

One of the main characteristics of networks is the coexistence of different kinds of relationships, personal and professional among these. The presence of multiple types of relationships modifies inter-firm dynamics, creating a space where traditional innovation activities take place in an unusual way. The present paper investigates the role played by personal relationships within networks, addressing the following research questions: how do different types of relationships existing in a network of SMEs favour the development of economic activities? And do personal relationships play a role in supporting innovative activities? To answer our research questions, we analyzed qualitative data using content analysis methodology. Content analysis allows researchers to obtain an objective, systematic, and quantitative description of the manifest content of a communication. Based on this analysis, we conclude that the coexistence of personal and professional relationships shapes a unique context that alters the usual dynamics of innovation diffusion.

Numerous recent acquisitions priced at enormous amounts have illustrated this development and revealed the need for adequate business valuation models. The value of an online social network is largely determined by the value of its users, the relationships between these users, and the resulting network effects. Therefore, the interconnectedness of a user within the network has to be considered explicitly to get a reasonable estimate for its economic value. Established standard business valuation models, however, do not account for these aspects sufficiently. Thus, we propose an economic model for the valuation of online social networks, which takes into account the users' interconnectedness within the network.

An example of such triad is a social structure comprising two producers connected via horizontal relationships and a customer connected to producers via vertical ties. Multiplex triads are important drivers of network evolution, but their dynamics remains poorly understood. Although conventional wisdom suggests that horizontal ties between producers are driven solely by their prior interactions, we find that vertical ties drive the formation of horizontal relationships in a multiplex triad. We also find that these triads are affected by the agency of the customers who (a) force producers into horizontal relationships with those producers that have protected the customers' interests in the past and (b) prevent closure in triads containing strong horizontal relationships because of the divergent objectives of these triads' members. By drawing attention to the existence of multiplex triads and their underlying dynamics, this paper advances a novel view on transitivity incorporating conflicting interests and agencies of actors within social systems.",2012"Mariotti, Francesca; Delbridge, Rick",Overcoming Network Overload and Redundancy in Interorganizational Networks: The Roles of Potential and Latent Ties,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,"This paper builds on Granovetter's distinction between strong and weak ties [Granovetter, M.

A longitudinal empirical study conducted with companies operating in the European motorsport industry reveals that firms take strategic actions to search for potential ties and reactivate latent ties in order to solve problems of network redundancy and overload. Examples are given, and their characteristics are examined to provide theoretical elaboration of the relationship between the types of tie and network evolution. These conceptual and empirical insights move understanding of the managerial challenge of building effective networks beyond static structural contingency models of optimal network forms to highlight the processes and capabilities of dynamic relationship building and network development.

Results suggest that network social capital is associated with self-rated health after adjustment for social support. Because different social classes have access to different sets of resources, resources of friends and family from the intermediate and higher service classes are beneficial for self-rated health, whereas resources of friends and family from the working class appear to be rather detrimental for self-rated health.

Such an organization presents a basic conundrum: Modules ought to be sufficiently independent to guarantee functional specialization and sufficiently connected to bind multiple processors for efficient information transfer. It is commonly accepted that small-world architecture of short paths and large local clustering may solve this problem. However, there is intrinsic tension between shortcuts generating small worlds and the persistence of modularity, a global property unrelated to local clustering. Here, we present a possible solution to this puzzle. We first show that a modified percolation theory can define a set of hierarchically organized modules made of strong links in functional brain networks. These modules are ""large-world"" self-similar structures and, therefore, are far from being small-world. However, incorporating weaker ties to the network converts it into a small world preserving an underlying backbone of well-defined modules. Remarkably, weak ties are precisely organized as predicted by theory maximizing information transfer with minimal wiring cost. This trade-off architecture is reminiscent of the ""strength of weak ties"" crucial concept of social networks.

The advantages of this method are its simplicity, accuracy, and low computational cost.

In this work, we focus on Twitter, one of the most popular online social networks, and find that the network formed by the basic type of connections is organized in groups. The activity of the users conforms to the landscape determined by such groups. Furthermore, Twitter's distinction between different types of interactions allows us to establish a parallelism between online and offline social networks: personal interactions are more likely to occur on internal links to the groups (the weakness of strong ties); events transmitting new information go preferentially through links connecting different groups (the strength of weak ties) or even more through links connecting to users belonging to several groups that act as brokers (the strength of intermediary ties).",2012"Bogolyubov, Pavel",The Strength of Ties on Social Networks: An Examination of Demographic Determinants,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, VOLS 1 AND 2","The paper is dedicated to assessing the factors influencing the number of strong, weak and potential ties an individual has on social networking sites, such as gender, age and the country of origin, the latter related to Hofstede's view that collectivism should manifest itself as a preference for stronger ties.

Such ties are formed irrespective of the organizational boundaries and formal structures and known as ego-centered networks of professionals. Ego-centered knowledge networks have not been recognised as efficient means of acquiring work-specific knowledge in the knowledge management literature. Research is needed to understand how ego-centric knowledge networks provide ready access to work-specific knowledge that can help professionals to solve complex problems and improve performance at work.

The level of specialization has increased in many branches, necessitating an emphasis on integrating the knowledge of many people with diverse backgrounds. Communication is key for both creative tasks and the coordination of processes. Despite the introduction of a variety of different IT-mediated communication systems in the last decades, the critical importance of face-to-face communication has remained untouched. Direct encounters enable people to gain trust in one another and to transfer more than just the spoken language. An encounter between people who were not planning to meet may be especially fruitful. Such coincidental meetings, so-called chance encounters, lead to the creation of weak ties, i.e. loose relationships. These facilitate access to new knowledge while keeping the diversity of opinions high. Encounters also catalyze the transformation of loose relationships into strong ties. Strong ties are especially important for efficient coordination. Workspace design may help to coordinate work, reveal conflicting opinions to a greater or lesser degree, help management steer knowledge creation and support company-wide projects. Chance encounters especially are vital for knowledge sharing, knowledge creation and the development of new and innovative ideas.

A holistic view of the design of the working environment, including its influence on the interactions between the employees and the barriers to and enablers of the flow of information, is presented. The findings show that the architecture of a building and the design of a workplace are important factors in increasing the number of face-to-face chance encounters. Another important, yet subordinate, factor which influences the number of chance encounters is the physical proximity to other researchers and companies. However, IT is the sphere of interaction in which most of the chance encounters take place. The findings of this study can help innovation managers and architects to shape innovative activities consciously. The framework and the figures which are presented in this paper finally help us to understand where chance encounters take place.",2012"Isomaki, Hannakaisa; Pohjamo, Ulla; Silvennoinen, Johanna",Ethnographic Sensibility: A Method for Studying Lurking as eLearning,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON E-LEARNING,"At present lurking is regarded as a notable eLearning strategy due to its frequency as a member strategy in online communities. Perspectives to lurking in eLearning vary in terms of activity, passivity, participation and contribution in relation to learning efficiency and outcomes. To enhance the notion of lurking as eLearning, a suitable research method is needed to provide conceptual means for shedding light to the specific discrete cultural nature of lurking and facilitate in bridging the relevant concepts and researchers' experiences in a way that fulfills the demands of valid inquiry. Particular methodological focus is then on the subtleties of interplay between researcher and interacting subjects in eLearning settings. In this conceptual-theoretical paper we propose online ethnographic sensibility as a research method for detecting weak ties involved in lurking as an eLearning approach.

Traditional neighborhood based methods such as Common neighbors, Jaccard Coefficient and Adamic/Adar are well studied in link prediction. However, the concept of structural holes does not receive significant attention in link prediction. As a preliminary work in studying structural holes, we focus on bipartite social networks, which is a special class of social networks that consists of two distinct roles for the users, and links are between users of different roles. In this study, a few implementations of structural holes are proposed, which are then validated with extended neighborhood based methods on a real dataset derived from IMDb network(1).

Conversely, strong ties are the people we really trust, people whose social circles tightly overlap with our own and, often, they are also the people most like us. Unfortunately, the majority of social media do not incorporate explicitly tie strength information in the creation and management of relationships, and treat all users the same: friend or stranger, with little or nothing in between. In the current work, we address the challenging issue of detecting on online social networks the strong and intimate ties from the huge mass of such mere social contacts. In order to do so, we propose a novel multidimensional definition of tie strength which exploits the existence of multiple online social links between two individuals. We test our definition on a multidimensional network constructed over users in Foursquare, Twitter and Facebook, analyzing the structural role of strong and weak links, and the correlations with the most common similarity measures.",2012"Grigoriou, Antonia",TYPOLOGY OF RELATIONS IN FACEBOOK FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS OF CYPRUS UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,"5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI 2012)","Online Social Networks attract more and more people every day. The most famous and popular social network is Facebook. Through obtaining an account in Facebook a person is able to create his own space and have his own personal audience. This is called 'Friends' in Facebook. What do students believe about the people they add to that list? What groups do they create according to their interpersonal relationships in their everyday lives? How the contact does occur between the student and every group of people? Why are the online social networks of students much larger than their social networks in real life? These questions were answered through qualitative and quantitative research focusing on students of the Cyprus University of Technology (C. U. T.). Data sources included online and paper-based questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. 339 students started the questionnaire but only 292 students completed it. The response rate of students was 16.2%. The confidence level of results of the questionnaire was 96% with a margin of error of 5.5%. The results showed that the undergraduate student of C. U. T. is connected to Facebook for a long period of time. Social capital is a network of people who are connected with strong or weak ties. The students create four groups of the people who are in their list on Facebook. The largest group is the social network of the individual. Depending on the relations between the student and each group can be characterized as bridging (relaxed) or bonding (strong). As mentioned in the results the number of people with whom the student maintains a strong relationship is very small compared with the 'friends' who have in their profile. By analysing the results, it was found that when someone has 200 friends two to nine are the closest, 10 to 90 are known and more than 90 are complete strangers. The student feels a need to increase its social capital by including even unknown people in that list. The reasons vary and they are described in detail in the paper. The paper has implications for students on social networking and directions for future research. Research in this field focused on the term of friendship in social network, and the reasons why a person adds friends to his list. However, no studies exist that a student can use categorization to separate his friends depending on their mediated interpersonal relationships.",2012"Hong, Dao Cheng; Ling, Hong; Zhang, Cheng Hong",An Exploration of Individual Level Tacit Knowledge Integration,"INTELLIGENT DECISION TECHNOLOGIES (IDT'2012), VOL 2","With the advanced knowledge economy, much attention has been placed on knowledge integration because of human beings' cognitive limits.

The social network approach examines how the structure of the network and players who hold important positions within it constrain or enable function. This information can be used to guide network management and optimise its operations. The aim of this study was to describe the structure of a translational cancer research network (TCRN) in Australia over its first year, identify the key players within the network and explore these players' opportunities and constraints in maximising important network collaborations. Methods and analysis: This study deploys a mixed-method longitudinal design using social network analysis augmented by interviews and review of TCRN documents. The study will use network documents and interviews with governing body members to explore the broader context into which the network is embedded as well as the perceptions and expectations of members. Of particular interest are the attitudes and perceptions of clinicians compared with those of researchers. A co-authorship network will be constructed of TCRN members using journal and citation databases to assess the success of past pre-network collaborations. Two whole network social network surveys will be administered 12 months apart and parameters such as density, clustering, centrality and betweenness centrality computed and compared using UCINET and Netdraw. Key players will be identified and interviewed to understand the specific activities, barriers and enablers they face in that role. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approvals were obtained from the University of New South Wales, South Eastern Sydney Northern Sector Local Health Network and Calvary Health Care Sydney. Results will be discussed with members of the TCRN, submitted to relevant journals and presented as oral presentations to clinicians, researchers and policymakers.",2012"Tipuric, Darko; Sliskovic, Tanja; Hruska, Domagoj",The Role of Managers' Social Capital in Acquiring New Knowledge with Regard to the Ownership Structure of the Firm,"IFKAD - KCWS 2012: 7TH INTERNATIONAL FORUM ON KNOWLEDGE ASSET DYNAMICS, 5TH KNOWLEDGE CITIES WORLD SUMMIT: KNOWLEDGE, INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY: INTEGRATING MICRO & MACRO PERSPECTIVES","Purpose - With our qualitative study of managers in private and state owned companies we wanted to see how the ownership structure of the firm influences the manner social capital affecting knowledge transfer within organizations is used and created. We anticipated that different mechanisms and different stakeholders seem to be important when forming the management's social capital. We observed the phenomena with an emphasis on the fact that Croatia is still in the early phase of development of good corporate governance practices and is characterized with a closed system of corporate governance. Also, we wanted to offer some practical implications considering the necessity of changing unconventional corporate governance practices in Croatia. Considering that this type of research has never been undertaken in this region, our study opens up new research horizons to be investigated with regard to idiosyncrasies of (post) transition economies. Design/methodology/approach - Due to the constructivist theoretical framework and the way research questions were set up, we used qualitative research methodology. Research methods used were open interviews (interview guide approach). We researched within 12 major Croatian companies where we interviewed 19 managers, in order to determine important categories and codes that helped us build a model of managerial entrenchment through their social capital. Originality/value - Even though social capital and its effect on knowledge transfer have been researched on numerous occasions, we have determined that the topic hasn't been researched in post-socialist economies. Considering that different cultural practices affect the nature of manager's social capital (Chua, Morris, Ingram, 2009), we saw an opportunity to show that social capital is used in a different manner in the South-east Europe region then in the established free-market economies with regard to ownership structure of the company. First, we expected that in state-owned firms social capital will turn out to be more underdeveloped than is the case in private enterprises. We also determined that no matter what the nature of the business, state-owned companies didn't use its social capital in a most productive manner if society's benefits as a whole are taken into account. As a matter of fact, social capital was used in order for managers to entrench themselves through political connections in all state owned companies we examined. Thus, our research provides a completely new insight on the effect of ownership structure on manager's social capital. Practical implications - As our research results show positive effects of social capital in terms of transferring and acquiring knowledge needed for problem solving, policy recommendations should be brought in Croatia in order for boards to support collaboration inside and outside organizations. Also, the negative consequences of social capital used in state owned companies regarding managerial entrenchment should be avoided for the benefit of making companies' business practices more transparent and accountable. The issue of state owning a large part of Croatian companies (over one third) carries many problems within the development of Croatian corporate governance. Knowing that state owned companies in transition countries have many obstacles that prevent them from doing business effectively, our research explicitly warns about one of the treats to obtaining lucrative business results within state owned companies. We suggest that future research in this track should determine how the phenomenon of different ownership structures affects the way social capital is nurtured.",2012"Patacchini, Eleonora; Zenou, Yves",Urban Crime and Ethnicity,REVIEW OF NETWORK ECONOMICS,"Using spatial data analysis techniques, we compare the spatial distribution of crime and the black population density across the London boroughs.

Then, we examine whether weak ties hypothesis holds in these interaction graphs and analyze the impacts on information diffusion. Furthermore, we model the temporal patterns of user interactions and cluster users based on the temporal patterns. Our findings demonstrate that although users in the two platforms share some common interaction patterns, users in Sina Weibo are more popular and diverse.

And the embeddedness of industrial cluster is a fundamental characteristic of social networks. According to the principle of Granovetter's ""weak ties"", the tie strength of the individual and the extent of the heterogeneity of the located network indirectly affect the validity of the information that the individual in the network obtains. Therefore, the strong ties and weak ties play a unique role in cluster network trade and innovation.

Design/methodology/approach - In this study, samples were selected from the legislative election of 2008 conducted in Taiwan, and focused on the candidates' competition strategies in the five major cities with the highest population density in Taiwan. Findings - The findings in this study indicate that the relationship among the three main external networks supports the curvilinear effect for gathering fundraising activities/contributions for the election. However, the impact of the number of votes obtained only reveals positive statistical significance on the part of individuals, not of firms and groups, despite the indication of a positive relationship. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study is that only the election of members for the Legislative Yuan in Taiwan is used. The study could be further extended to look into other types of elections, such as the election of representatives and councilors for the counties and also the presidential election. A comparative analysis for different types of elections could also be performed to find out whether there are any other different implications for the election strategies. Practical implications - It is realized only through members' levels of collective goal orientation and shared trust, which create value by facilitating successful collective action.

This paper addresses this issue by examining the role of spatial, social and cognitive proximity of personal knowledge relationships in the Cambridge information technology cluster. It is shown that distinguishing between sub-dimensions of cognitive proximity can clarify the 'proximity paradox'. Moreover, the results highlight that local relationships enable access to cognitively more diverse knowledge than non-local ones.

The objective of this paper is to address this gap in the literature, ultimately enhancing understanding of the link between the structural configuration of social capital and individual learning. Design/methodology/approach - An online questionnaire survey was administered to employees affiliated to 22 pharmacies in Sweden to gather attributional and relational data on the individual level. Social network analysis techniques were used to describe salient structural characteristics of individuals' social capital. The impact of social capital on individual learning was explored through ordinal logistic regression models based on maximum likelihood estimations. Findings - The presence of structural holes initially increases the degree of individual learning, then reaches a maximum and begins to gradually decrease. Practical implications - The results of the study provide valuable input for the development and management of networks within firms, in order to improve learning and innovation. In addition, given the close proximity between learning, as conceptualized in this study and other job attitudes, human resource management practices in general could benefit greatly from the results.

The interviews were analysed using a comparative cross-case analysis. A distinction was made between 'strong' (long-term and intimate), 'weak' (short-term and non-intimate) and 'formal' (e.g., professional counsellors) relations. Findings showed that strong and formal relations were rather influential on people's engagement in biographical learning while weak relations were important to the straightforward career. Since transitions in late modern society has become not only a passage but also a learning option, the different sources and functions of social relations should be considered a vital part of outplacement counselling.

An original viewpoint is presented in this chapter - the thinking is novel to integration literature and thought, and to social networks - that advances both research and practice of PMI. Since the network-view may be a new topic to many PMI researchers, the central discussion is preceded by a brief introduction to the concepts and techniques of social network analysis. The author offers that the organizational members' pre-existing social network can become disrupted by integration processes, which creates pressures on the individuals' previously stable social network. The individual members will therefore strive for a restabilization of their localized social network towards a specific pattern that is somewhat unique to each individual. During this social realignment there is an opportunity for integration managers to embrace this ""social reconciliation."" By recognizing the individuals' imminent stabilization point of this natural process, integration managers can proactively guide the social network toward an optimal, or productive, resting space that provides organizational benefit. This chapter puts forward the particulars of this phenomenon and offers exploratory suggestions for how a practitioner might influence the re-establishment of the organizational social network in a manner consistent with individuals' preferences and simultaneously beneficial to the organization overall.

Firms would be proactively asking for the complementarity between the activities of internal knowledge creation and the assimilation of external knowledge from different sources, forming strategic alliances between them. Specifically, innovation can be regarded as resulting from research opportunities focused on how knowledge creation and diffusion processes would benefit from localized knowledge spillovers between firms colocated within industrial clusters, defined as a network of personnel, or an interorganizational and institutional network. However, the literature has not yet well understood how these processes benefit from both these localized knowledge spillovers and networks within the cluster or whether their effects are consistently positive. This chapter, grounded in the resource-based view, the Scandinavian Approach to the industrial district, and the social capital perspective, and with a multilevel analysis, presents a synthesis of the existing theory on the knowledge creation and transfer processes within industrial districts, and proposes a theoretical framework by studying in depth the relationships between district-level and firm-specific capacities, as well as the effects of the in tracluster networks on both the firm's knowledge-generative and absorptive capacities, and its skill in facing both incremental and radical technological innovation.

However, much of the literature on networks is characterized as associative, considering them only as cumulative constructs through the constant enrollment of additional actors. Through the lens of social capital and a discussion of the limitations of the networking paradigm in economic geography, this article aims to move beyond this associative nature and introduce variance in network practices in the form of nonworking and not working. By presenting a hypothetical example of a project-based network, we introduce the concepts of nonworking and not working as latency and disassociation as dimensions of network practices. In doing so, we present a more nuanced approach to the networking paradigm in relational economic geography, one that moves beyond a purely associative understanding to incorporate nonworking and not working.",2012"Messias, DeAnne K.

The findings illustrated both the role of social networks in gathering information, making decisions and accessing resources, and how these existing social networks were disrupted and strained by overwhelming needs. Broader structural issues, including poverty and a lack of transportation, combined with marginalised status as immigrants, further constrained access to essential information and resources. In response, new, if temporary, social networks emerged, based primarily on shared nationality, language, and a sense of collective commitment.

Theories about social interaction, such as Granovetter's (1973) theory of weak ties and Burt's (1995) theory of structural holes, are used to understand how large, diverse networks may impact not only information exchange, but information and skills necessary for entrepreneurship. Also, Wilkinson's (1991) interactional field theory is presented as a way to understand how not only network ties, but the content that flows over those ties in the form of a common community purpose, can equally structure behavior around entrepreneurship. Hypotheses are generated from these social theories and tested empirically using a six-community case study involving both entrepreneurs and institutional actors/representatives in both high- and low-entrepreneurship communities.

There are, however, a growing number of new-generation migrants whose prospects of integration cannot be gleaned from the experience of their predecessors the old-generation migrants. The reconstruction of migrant network is a lens through which one can examine the extent and pattern of their integration. In this paper, using quantitative data derived from a survey of eight urbanized villages in Guangzhou, we examine the socio-spatial pattern of migrant networks and the role of receiving neighborhoods in social interactions, with a focus on inter-generational differences. The findings show that new-generation migrants are more likely to draw on cross-class, non-kin, and non-territorial networks when seeking social support, but that hometown-based bonds and the urbanite-migrant divisions remain central to their social networks. For the role of receiving neighborhoods, although new-generation migrants have weak neighborly interactions, they construct numerous colleagues and friendship ties that transcend the boundaries of neighborhoods. Moreover, educational attainment, income level, and occupation structure are important determinants of the nature of new-generation migrant networks. The results suggest that generational factors should be highly considered when studying the integration of migrants into Chinese urban society. Accordingly, the integration of migrants into the urban society will be a conflictual and contradictory process. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that paisanos are important in providing lodging to those from rural areas, and family members are more likely to assist those from urban settings. Paisanos are more likely to help at the beginning of the migratory flow of the community (rural or urban), and family members to do so once the flow has matured. Also, paisanos are more likely to help those in rural areas during more difficult times, such as after the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Results show that informal labour market in Serbia follows the structure of the secondary labour market and signals vulnerability on part of youths employed there. Education dropouts are largely channelled to the informal sector, whereas favourably educated Serbian graduates are less attracted to it. Job search via social networks facilitates entry to unregistered employment, but slows down entry to registered employment for job seekers. Whereas stratification of labour market entry by education largely follows patterns of primary and secondary labour market attainment in any industrialized society, the effects of contacts might exhibit traces of inefficiencies peculiar to the transformation countries.

This article examines the comparative effectiveness of different types of social ties used by a job seeker and proposes an explanation for the inconsistency in empirical evidence for strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis. Methods. Granovetter's strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis predicted that in a job search, weak ties (acquaintances) are a more valuable source of information as compared to strong ties (close friends or relatives). However, subsequent empirical research has provided ambiguous support for this hypothesis. To sort out the conflicting results, a mathematical model of the transmission of job information through a contact network has been constructed. Along with the strength of tie, a widely used characteristic of contact, the model also incorporates the work relation of tie. Results. The model has numerous implications with strong empirical support, as well as propositions going beyond the findings of prior empirical work, which can be evaluated in subsequent studies. It is shown that the effectiveness of a certain type of contact depends on both the ego's status (weak and work-related contacts are more advantageous for higher-status workers) and the composition of the ego's network (work-related contacts promote the effectiveness of weak ties, while strong-tie contacts hinder the effectiveness of work-related ties). In particular, it implies that the inconsistency in empirical evidence for the strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis can be explained by the differences in status or the proportion of work-related contacts in the samples examined. Conclusion. Work-related ties play a significant role in the analysis of informal job-search methods; their incorporation into the model allows one to account for a number of previously unexplained empirical results.",2011"Wuchty, Stefan; Uzzi, Brian",Human Communication Dynamics in Digital Footsteps: A Study of the Agreement between Self-Reported Ties and Email Networks,PLOS ONE,"Digital communication data has created opportunities to advance the knowledge of human dynamics in many areas, including national security, behavioral health, and consumerism. While digital data uniquely captures the totality of a person's communication, past research consistently shows that a subset of contacts makes up a person's ""social network"" of unique resource providers. To address this gap, we analyzed the correspondence between self-reported social network data and email communication data with the objective of identifying the dynamics in e-communication that correlate with a person's perception of a significant network tie. First, we examined the predictive utility of three popular methods to derive social network data from email data based on volume and reciprocity of bilateral email exchanges. Second, we observed differences in the response dynamics along self-reported ties, allowing us to introduce and test a new method that incorporates time-resolved exchange data. Using a range of robustness checks for measurement and misreporting errors in self-report and email data, we find that the methods have similar predictive utility.

For example, SNS (social network service) companies now sell customers digital decorative products for the adornment of online avatars. Not only do individual customers consume these digital products, but they also exchange them as gifts in their local neighborhoods. While previous studies on customer valuation (e.g. CLTV, RFM, etc.) focus on some important issues for identifying valuable customers, the literature does not resolve issues related to the effects on customer value of products purchased as gifts for another person. This study attempts to verify empirically the effects of two representative social network properties (tie strength and the number of ties) on customer monetary value. This study selects 2615 customers from a South Korean SNS website who enrolled on the site on the same day. Data include diverse purchase-related information, social network properties in terms of gift-giving for six months, and demographic information. The primary results of this study are as follows. First, the proposed model, which includes social network properties, has a great deal more explanatory power than the baseline model - the RFM-based customer value model. Second, tie strength and the number of ties in a gift-giving network increase customer value. Third, tie strength has a more profound impact on customer value than does the number of ties. The results of this study theoretically expand the domain of customer valuation studies due to the inclusion of social network properties, and suggest important practical implications for some online SNS companies in their efforts to find valuable customers and improve customer value.

This paper focuses on the potential for strong ties to facilitate, rather than prohibit, innovation. It is based in a 7-year longitudinal research project with Adidas, a global sporting goods company. From the case, we find that the paradox of tie strength results from an overly simplified view of the nature of company-customer relationships. Contrary to the established literature, we find that strong ties in the Adidas case supported significant innovation. In fact, the involvement resulted in the development of a new product with a radically different product architecture and led to one of the most successful product launches in the company's history.

Results from fixed effects regression on panel data from the NLSY show that experience is related to informal entry into new jobs, though in a very specific way. The odds of being informally recruited into a new job improve as work experience in related occupations rises, but this relationship holds only among men.

Collective MMORPG play is conceptualized as the frequency of joint gaming actions and garners' assessment of the experience in MMORPG guilds and groups. Social capital at the individual level refers to the resources and support provided by bonding and bridging social networks; collective-level social capital refers to people's civic engagement. A two-wave online survey was conducted to collect data from 232 Chinese MMORPG players. Two structural equation models were developed to test whether collective play influences offline social capital via the mediation of online social capital; the results did not demonstrate the existence of mediation effects. Specifically, collective play positively influences garners' online bonding social capital, online bridging social capital and online civic engagement. The effect of collective play on offline bonding and bridging social capital is not significant; the effect of online bonding/bridging social capital on offline bonding/bridging social capital is not significant either. The study finds a significantly positive impact of collective play on offline civic engagement. The effect of online civic engagement on offline civic engagement is not significant. In contrast with collective play, the time of gaming is found to negatively influence online and offline social capital. This study contributes to the knowledge of social capital because it tests the effects of new media on online and offline social capital in the Chinese culture. In addition, this study provides empirical evidence for the positive effects of online games and highlights the social experience in MMORPG play and how it influences gamers' social networks and collective participation.

As expected, we found a significant relationship between the centrality of a network and individual performance. When network centrality was decomposed into three types (advice centrality, influence centrality and idea centrality), however, the relative strength of each type changed significantly based on performance type. We also found that the number of weak ties had a significant positive effect both on innovative and managerial performance. When considered together with network centrality and absorptive capacity, however, weak ties turned out to be nonsignificant as predictors of managerial performance, but the strongest predictors of innovative performance. In contrast, absorptive capacity had a positive effect on both types of individual performance, while its strength as a determinant of individual performance was weaker than that of network centrality and weak ties.

Through tight bonds of trust and reciprocity, these networks are considered to be sources of social capital, providing a counter-balance to the disadvantages that migrants may encounter in the destination society. This paper argues that more attention is needed to the ways in which migrants access, maintain and construct different types of networks, in varied social locations, with diverse people. I suggest that the often simplistic dichotomy of bonding and bridging capital needs to be re-appraised and instead offer an alternative way of thinking about these social ties. The distinction between them tends to be understood on the basis of the ethnicity of the people involved-bonding involves close ties with 'people like us' while bridging involves links beyond 'group cleavages'. Insufficient attention has been paid to the actual resources flowing between these ties or the kinds of relationship developing between the actors involved. The nature of these social networks may be better understood by focusing on the relationship between the actors, their relative social location, and their available and realisable resources.

We extend this literature by connecting alcohol use, dating, and peers to understand the diffusion of drinking behavior in school-based friendship networks. Drawing on Granovetter's classic concept of weak ties, we argue that adolescent romantic partners are likely to be network bridges, or liaisons, connecting daters to new peer contexts that, in turn, promote changes in individual drinking behaviors and allow these behaviors to spread across peer networks. Using longitudinal data of 449 couples from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate Actor-Partner Interdependence Models and identify unique contributions of partners' drinking, friends' drinking, and friends-of-partners' drinking to daters' own future binge drinking and drinking frequency. Findings support the liaison hypothesis and suggest that friends-of-partners' drinking have net associations with adolescent drinking patterns. Moreover, the coefficient for friends-of-partners' drinking is larger than the coefficient for one's own peers and generally immune to prior selection. Our findings suggest that romantic relationships are important mechanisms for understanding the diffusion of emergent problem behaviors in adolescent peer networks.",2011"Chauvet, Vincent; Chollet, Barthelemy; Soda, Giuseppe; Huault, Isabelle",The contribution of network research to managerial culture and practice,EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,"Although research on social networks has gained significant influence in the academic world, several factors seem to have lowered its echo in the business world.

We used a longitudinal approach and collected data through interviews and observations to identify the creative contributions and the actors who were involved at different time periods for each project. We mapped the relationships between actors who contributed to the development of each idea through creative thinking and/or helped it to become accepted both internally and externally over three-year windows. This method generated data on network evolution. We also carried out a qualitative analysis and identified four main factors explaining why actors turn to others during the idea-development process: (1) to gain access to information; (2) to enhance credibility; (3) to exercise one's influence; and (4) to gain access to knowledge through people or objects. We demonstrate that different types of ties or network structures are relied upon to reap different kinds of benefits. This may partially explain network evolution as an idea progresses through different development stages. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Accessing social capital in gendered and racialized networks",SOCIAL NETWORKS,"Network processes have long been implicated in the reproduction of labor market inequality, but it remains unclear whether white male networks provide more social capital resources than female and minority networks. Analysis of nationally representative survey data reveals that people in white male networks receive twice as many job leads as people in female/minority networks. White male networks are also comprised of higher status connections than female/minority networks. The information and status benefits of membership in these old boy networks accrue to all respondents and not just white men. Furthermore, gender homophilous contacts offer greater job finding assistance than other contacts. The results specify how social capital flows through gendered and racialized networks.

In other words, what role can an outside party-such as a government or state actor-play in constructing social capital when it is not a permanent fixture of the existing interrelationships within a community? Taking a network perspective, this exploratory research examines community-level social capital outcomes of a government-led intervention. Operationalized as social networks, social capital is measured as an increase to the strength of weak ties and reduction in redundancy among exchange relationships. Findings suggest that state-society synergy has the potential to increase bridging social capital in communities. In addition, communities with higher levels of cohesion and connectivity pre-intervention results in greater increases to social capital, and although trust plays a crucial role in development of social capital, the influence organizations are perceived to have does not.",2011"Agliari, E.; Cioli, C.; Guadagnini, E.",Percolation on correlated random networks,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,"We consider a class of random, weighted networks, obtained through a redefinition of patterns in an Hopfield-like model, and, by performing percolation processes, we get information about topology and resilience properties of the networks themselves. Given the weighted nature of the graphs, different kinds of bond percolation can be studied: stochastic (deleting links randomly) and deterministic (deleting links based on rank weights), each mimicking a different physical process. The evolution of the network is accordingly different, as evidenced by the behavior of the largest component size and of the distribution of cluster sizes. In particular, we can derive that weak ties are crucial in order to maintain the graph connected and that, when they are the most prone to failure, the giant component typically shrinks without abruptly breaking apart; these results have been recently evidenced in several kinds of social networks.",2011"Freeman, Kendralin J.; Condron, Dennis J.",SCHMOOZING IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL CAPITAL TO FIRST GRADERS,SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,"Sociologists have investigated the importance of social capital for many outcomes, but the influence of various types of social capital-particularly intergenerational closure-on inequality in students' academic skills remains unclear.

However, empirical evidence of the relationship between social linkages and innovation in education is scarce. Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the impact of social network structure on schools' innovative climate, as mediated by teachers' involvement in decision-making. Setting: This article reports on a study among 775 educators in 53 elementary schools in a large educational system in the Netherlands.

Conclusions/Recommendations: Findings indicated that the more densely connected teachers were in regard to work-related and personal advice, the more they perceived their schools' climate to be supportive of innovation. Highly dense work-related network structures also typified teams that perceived strong teacher involvement in decision-making.

The data also suggest that these multiple engagements and overlapping activisms effectively provide linkages to and integration within social movement networks.

Recently, it has also been identified in regional studies as a factor behind regional development and consensus building. Policies are therefore needed to support such knowledge acquisition. The approach is based on the concepts of knowledge as a 'club good', and of social capital, where the latter is seen as a set of assets which can overcome obstacles to knowledge exchange. A taxonomy of social capital and knowledge is proposed and relationships among the considered dimensions are hypothesized. A multivariate analysis at the individual level is applied to data collected in the Republic of Latvia, including a sensitivity analysis with regard to socio-demographic dimensions.

However, as universities are becoming increasingly diverse in their staff composition, new problems for the social climate may develop. Organisations where members are open to diversity are known to be better integrated and to perform better. While the relation between a positive social climate and group functioning is well documented, we know much less about antecedents for such a climate. Purpose: The aim of this study is to examine the effect of internal learning and knowledge sharing engagement (sharing informal knowledge of a personal nature and the staffs application of each other's knowledge to task relevant problems) on diversity climate (openness to linguistic, visual, value and informational diversity) among university teachers. Sample: The study used questionnaire responses from 489 teachers in multicultural Danish university departments. Design and methods: To study antecedents for a good diversity climate, statistical analysis including hierarchical multiple regressions was applied. Conclusions: Results showed that group members' engagement in: (1) sharing informal knowledge of a personal nature; and (2) their application of each other's knowledge to task relevant problems had strong positive associations with openness to linguistic, visible, value and informational diversity.

We examine how access to valuable knowledge available to firms via organizational relationships creates learning opportunities necessary for the development of complex technological capabilities. Using a sample of 852 observations of emerging economy firms from the Indian software industry between 1992 and 2000, we find that developing strong domestic intra-organizational relationships, through affiliation with a moderately diversified business group or operating in a related industry, promote more complex technological capabilities. In the case of foreign inter-organizational relationships, we find that greater foreign client contact enhances the complexity of firm technological capabilities. However, accessing knowledge from domestic inter-organizational relationships appears to hinder the development of firm complex technological capabilities. An interesting result from our research was that having greater access to knowledge from foreign intra-organizational relationships, embedded within foreign subsidiaries, did not lead to the development of complex firm technological capabilities. The results of our study highlight that for emerging economy firms wanting to improve their complex technological capabilities, there may be diminishing benefits to learning from and acquiring knowledge available within specific types of formal organizational relationships.

In a sample of 157 Dutch business-to-business innovation relationships, they observe that embedded ties weaken how much suppliers benefit from customer innovation knowledge because of worries about customer opportunism (the dark side of embedded ties). However, they uncover three moderating relationship and governance features that allow suppliers to overcome these dark-side effects and even increase innovation (the bright side of embedded ties).

However, there is a certain amount of confusion about network theory-for example, what it is, what is distinctive about it, and how to generate new theory. This paper attempts to remedy the situation by clarifying the fundamental concepts of the field (such as the network) and characterizing how network reasoning works. We start by considering the definition of network, noting some confusion caused by two different perspectives, which we refer to as realist and nominalist. We then analyze two well-known network theories, Granovetter's strength of weak ties theory [Granovetter, M. S. 1973. The strength of weak ties. Amer. J. Sociol. 78(6) 1360-1380] and Burt's structural holes theory [Burt, R. S. 1992. Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition.

We argue that both theories share an underlying theoretical model, which we label the network flow model, from which we derive additional implications. We also discuss network phenomena that do not appear to fit the flow model and discuss the possibility of a second fundamental model, which we call the bond model. We close with a discussion of the merits of model-based network theorizing for facilitating the generation of new theory, as well as a discussion of endogeneity in network theorizing.",2011"Jo, Hang-Hyun; Pan, Raj Kumar; Kaski, Kimmo",Emergence of Bursts and Communities in Evolving Weighted Networks,PLOS ONE,"Understanding the patterns of human dynamics and social interaction and the way they lead to the formation of an organized and functional society are important issues especially for techno-social development. Addressing these issues of social networks has recently become possible through large scale data analysis of mobile phone call records, which has revealed the existence of modular or community structure with many links between nodes of the same community and relatively few links between nodes of different communities. The weights of links, e.g., the number of calls between two users, and the network topology are found correlated such that intra-community links are stronger compared to the weak inter-community links. This feature is known as Granovetter's ""The strength of weak ties'' hypothesis. In addition to this inhomogeneous community structure, the temporal patterns of human dynamics turn out to be inhomogeneous or bursty, characterized by the heavy tailed distribution of time interval between two consecutive events, i.e., inter-event time. In this paper, we study how the community structure and the bursty dynamics emerge together in a simple evolving weighted network model. The principal mechanisms behind these patterns are social interaction by cyclic closure, i.e., links to friends of friends and the focal closure, links to individuals sharing similar attributes or interests, and human dynamics by task handling process. These three mechanisms have been implemented as a network model with local attachment, global attachment, and priority-based queuing processes. By comprehensive numerical simulations we show that the interplay of these mechanisms leads to the emergence of heavy tailed inter-event time distribution and the evolution of Granovetter-type community structure. Moreover, the numerical results are found to be in qualitative agreement with empirical analysis results from mobile phone call dataset.",2011"Eklinder-Frick, Jens; Eriksson, Lars-Torsten; Hallen, Lars",Bridging and bonding forms of social capital in a regional strategic network,INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT,"Research on networks emphasizes the importance of bonds between actors.

The findings also indicate that rather than being proactive, family SMEs respond reactively to opportunities that emerge coincidentally.

Understanding the functional building blocks of social media,BUSINESS HORIZONS,"Traditionally, consumers used the Internet to simply expend content: they read it, they watched it, and they used it to buy products and services. Increasingly, however, consumers are utilizing platforms such as content sharing sites, blogs, social networking, and wikis to create, modify, share, and discuss Internet content. This represents the social media phenomenon, which can now significantly impact a firm's reputation, sales, and even survival. Yet, many executives eschew or ignore this form of media because they don't understand what it is, the various forms it can take, and how to engage with it and learn. In response, we present a framework that defines social media by using seven functional building blocks: identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. As different social media activities are defined by the extent to which they focus on some or all of these blocks, we explain the implications that each block can have for how firms should engage with social media. To conclude, we present a number of recommendations regarding how firms should develop strategies for monitoring, understanding, and responding to different social media activities.

An organizational embeddedness perspective,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES,"We apply an organizational embeddedness perspective to examine international assignees' retention with the organization. Specifically, we hypothesize that assignees' social ties within and their perceived fit with the host unit positively relate to two sacrifices on leaving the organization: their firm-specific learning during the assignment, and their perceived career prospects in the organization. Perceived career prospects are expected to predict subsequent retention, moderated by firm-specific learning. These hypotheses are tested using a sample of 143 inpatriates in 10 German multinationals, with retention measured 2 and 4 years later. We show that inpatriates' trusting ties with HQ staff and their fit with the HQ positively relate to their firm-specific learning and their perceived career prospects, and that the latter predicts their retention 2 and 4 years later. Perceived career prospects mediate the direct relationship between inpatriates' fit with the HQ and inpatriate retention, and the indirect relationship between inpatriates' trusting ties with HQ staff and their retention. Furthermore, inpatriates' firm-specific learning mitigates the effect of perceived career prospects on retention decisions 2 years later. We contribute to the organizational embeddedness, careers, and international business literatures by explaining when and how facets of organizational embeddedness relate to assignee retention.

Although Coleman focused on the quality of relationships, Burt argued that the structural configuration of relationships was more important. I argue that, instead of being alternative substitutes. Burt's social capital theory complements Coleman's theory. More precisely, I demonstrate that, in the presence of strong ties, weak network architectures (structural holes or a peripheral network position) leverage the strength of strong ties in the creation of innovation. This implies that weak network architectures have no value without strong ties, whereas strong ties have some value without weak network architectures but are leveraged by this type of structure. The findings indicate that innovation research tends to overestimate the impact of weak network architectures in the creation of innovation. By pointing to the necessity of strong ties, the results may be of particular interest for research on open innovation. They suggest that open innovation will not work if closed innovation principles are pushed back. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

With advances in information and communication technology, sharing information across organizations has become more feasible. In the public sector, government agencies are also aware of the importance of information sharing for addressing policy issues such as anti-terrorism and public health. However, information sharing can be a complex task. Identifying factors that influence information sharing is critical. In the literature, research in information sharing focuses on the interpersonal, intra-organizational, and inter-organizational levels. This paper reviews the current information-sharing research, discusses the factors affecting information sharing at the three levels, and provides summative frameworks.

This theoretical framework originates from Fiske's (1991, 1992) Relational Models Theory (RMT). The RMT distinguishes four relational models: communal sharing, authority ranking, equality matching and market pricing. We conducted two case studies and investigated how people use different relational models for their knowledge sharing activities. Based on case studies of a governmental organization and an industrial research group, we describe how the relational context guides knowledge sharing behavior. We show that the willingness to share knowledge is rooted in different relational models and that people only share knowledge when they share similar relational models. Furthermore, effective knowledge sharing takes place when incentive systems and knowledge management systems are appropriated to the relational model in use. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Given that organizational attitudes and behaviors are often socially constructed, this article argues that employees' affective commitment is influenced by their social networks in an organization. What are the social network configurations that lead to affective organizational commitment? This study attempts to answer this question by focusing on nonlinear relationships between several network dimensions (i.e., network centrality, tie strength, and structural holes) and affective commitment. These relationships are empirically tested by using both social network data and employee survey data collected from two local governments in South Korea. Results of the study show that employees' network centrality has an inverted U-shaped relationship with affective commitment and structural holes have a U-shaped association with affective commitment, controlling for certain organizational rewards and individual attributes.

Furthermore, taken together, tie strength and network range significantly enhance TE venture performance.

Moreover, for those nurses who did not include the NUM in their workplace network, their position appears even worse.

The first objective of the study relates to providing new insights into the international market development activities through the application of a network perspective. The chapter reviews the international business literature to ascertain the development of thought, the research gaps, and the shortcomings. This review shows that the network perspective is a useful and popular theoretical domain that researchers can use to understand international activities, particularly of small, high technology, resource-constrained firms. The second research objective is to gain a deeper understanding of network capability. This chapter presents a model for the impact of network capability on international performance by building on the emerging literature on the dynamic capabilities view of the firm. The model conceptualizes network capability in terms of network characteristics, network operation, and network resources. Network characteristics comprise strong and weak ties (operationalized as foreign-market entry modes), relational capability, and the level of trust between partners. Network operation focuses on network initiation, network coordination, and network learning capabilities. Network resources comprise network human-capital resources, synergy-sensitive resources (resource combinations within the network), and information sharing within the network. The third research objective is to determine the impact of networking capability on the international performance of SMEs. The study analyzes 11 hypotheses through structural equations modeling using LISREL. The hypotheses relate to strong and weak ties, the relative strength of strong ties over weak ties, and each of the eight remaining constructs of networking capability in the study. The research conducts a cross-sectional study by using a sample of SMEs drawn from the telecommunications industry in Ireland. The study supports the hypothesis that strong ties are more influential on international performance than weak ties. Similarly, network coordination and human-capital resources have a positive and significant association with international performance. Strong ties, weak ties, trust, network initiation, synergy-sensitive resources, relational capability, network learning, and information sharing do not have a significant association with international performance. The results of this study are strong (R-2 = 0.63 for performance as the outcome) and provide a number of interesting insights into the relations between collaboration or networking capability and performance.

In response to the need for speedy knowledge collaboration, professionals often rely on their ego-centered (i.e. personal) knowledge networks. Ego-centered knowledge networks are ties that develop through work-related interactions and/or professional associations. Such ties exist irrespective of the organizational boundaries and formal structures and create when people work together, carry out projects mutually; attend joint trainings or workshops, participate in the activities of professional communities, and so on and so forth. Studies have indicated positive contribution of personal knowledge networking in fostering cooperative learning and improving problem-solving capabilities of individuals. Nonetheless, literature on information and knowledge sharing widely discussed such knowledge sharing activities in collocated teams and within organizational boundaries. Many contemporary knowledge management researchers, however, are of the view that knowledge cannot be constrained within boundaries and structures and that most new knowledge lies outside organizational boundaries. In search of non-redundant and specialist knowledge, employees develop ad-hoc knowledge collaboration with colleagues, in their relevant professions and knowledge domains, regardless of the time and space constraints. Knowledge can be defined as the know-how or expertise that is mainly possessed by humans. The way to knowledge is via connecting to people who know or who know whom to contact for a specific problem solution. In today's knowledge economy, there is a crucial need to pay attention to the fast, reliable, and economic sources of knowledge that can help knowledge workers to quickly resolve complex problems at work. While addressing this need, knowledge management research has largely discussed knowledge sources that exist within organizational boundaries and that can be arranged through formal structures and organizational mechanisms. So far, little is known how knowledge is mediated through personal interactions and informal communication between knowledge workers who belong to similar professions but work in different organizations and work settings. In fact, evidence from some of the knowledge-intensive professions, such as, bio-technology, information and communication technology, software development, and so on, suggest that personal connections between knowledge workers provide significant opportunities to access specialized knowledge. In these professions, interactions between knowledge workers are not constrained by the boundaries and formal structures. Although social networking studies have highlighted the significance of informal knowledge sharing, little is known about how professionals deal with the opportunities and complexities of knowledge collaboration that exist within their ego-centered knowledge networks. Knowledge management scholars have discussed the use of transactive memory (i.e. who knows what) in determining the locus of expertise to solve a problem. Information and knowledge sharing literature focus on trust to manage individual concerns and the risks involved in informal information or know-how exchange. Informal know-how trading literature highlighted reciprocity to foster useful knowledge exchange relationships; in the absence of formal knowledge sharing structures and mechanisms. Combining these, this paper argues that transactive memory, trust, and reciprocity can provide necessary conditions to allow knowledge workers to collaborate freely and share their know-how and expertise in their ego-centered knowledge networks.",2011"Schwab, Andreas; Miner, Anne S.",ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING IMPLICATIONS OF PARTNERING FLEXIBILITY IN PROJECT-VENTURE SETTINGS: A MULTILEVEL FRAMEWORK,PROJECT-BASED ORGANIZING AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT,"Project ventures are an increasingly prevalent organizational form in many industries.

This partnering flexibility creates opportunities to respond to new knowledge about characteristics of project tasks and project partners. Partnering flexibility, however, also creates learning challenges. The short-term nature of relationships between project partners and the disintegration of the project team after project completion challenges the accumulation and transfer of knowledge to future projects. Beyond the introduction of related learning opportunities and challenges, we identify potential contingency factors in the project context that shape when partner flexibility will have beneficial versus harmful effects. On the organizational level, we propose that project-governing permanent organizations can support project-venture learning. On the industry level, we highlight potential learning benefits of standardized partner roles and coordination practices. Thus, our chapter introduces a multilevel contingency framework for the evaluation of both learning opportunities and challenges of partnering flexibility in project-venture settings.

Since the inception of web 2.0 the popularity of social networks (SNS) has continued to increase. Some SNS are based on six degreess of separation (6SNS), and these have emerged as the most frequently visited WWW sites. Design/methodology/approach - Using a randomized control group pre-test-post-test experimental design, responses to a questionaire to test the differences among 6SNS users and non-users on 12 issues of benefit were analyzed. Findings - The tests show, first, that, compared with traditional virtual communities, SNS evoke higher ratings for ""trust in website,"" ""trust in other members,"" and ""quality of friends."" Second, SNS can provide users with entertainment and greater social involvement. People who use these sites express postive attitudes about them. Third, no significant differences were found between SNS and traditional internet media on ""meeting new friends,"" ""maintaining relationships,"" ""searching for friends,"" ""searching for information,"" and ""understanding and learning."" These results can be attributed to language differences. Originality/value - The value of 6SNS is recognized by the business world. In October 2007, Microsoft invested $240 million to buy 1.6 percent shares of Facebook. Today Facebook alone has more than 300 million users.

In large, complex organizations employees face multiple roles that compete for their time and may be conflicting. The paper seeks to analyze the interplay between the communities, the line organization, and the employees; specifically, to examine how the quality of management of the communities, the attitudes of line managers, and the employees' motivation for participating in the communities facilitate knowledge application. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted a survey in an organization with several specialized, horizontal knowledge communities. In total, 2,517 responses were obtained from members of 131 different communities. Findings - First, community management, line support and intrinsic motivation have a positive impact on knowledge application. Second, the effect of line support is stronger when employees are intrinsically motivated. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to one organization. Future research could study knowledge processes in matrix-like organization, as well as the role of community coordinators for knowledge sharing and application. Practical implications - To enhance knowledge sharing and knowledge application, commitment from both line managers and community coordinators is vital. In a matrix-like organization, dialogue and communication are important in order to reconcile supplementary goals and considerations.

In this context private and public consultancies should provide advice for the innovation management of SMEs. This is to some extent politically introduced but the offer of advisory service is seldom used. The integration of consultancies leads to weak relations in the cooperating innovation network and so the risk of losing the competitive edge increases. Based on a Danish- German dataset, this contribution addresses the question of which conditions initiate and impede the utilization of the consulting system from a business point of view.

Applying information processing theory and social network theory, this research explores three approaches that buyers can use to manage the interface between interdependent first-tier suppliers during product development. These are (1) using an interactive team, (2) making a supplier-supplier connection by encouraging first-tier suppliers to communicate, coordinate and mutually adjust and (3) using a modular design. Data were gathered in an online survey of buying firms in manufacturing industries and hypotheses were tested using hierarchical moderated regression.

Email communication datasets are typically transformed into networks in which nodes designate email users and ties connect nodes if an email has been exchanged between the corresponding users. Unfortunately, this method of extracting sender-recipient dyads from multiple recipient emails conceals information regarding the nature of affiliations and the process by which they come about. Specifically, the findings of this paper indicate that recipient lists of a user's outgoing emails are not arbitrary subsets of the user's contacts. Instead, recipient lists delineate meaningful organizational units so that being co-recipients of the same email(s) is a stronger indication of affiliation than being neighbors of the same node(s). Moreover, the number of recipients in an email reveals not only the nature of affiliations within the network but also the way in which these relationships are likely to unfold. Methodologically, this paper engages in a search for new ways to construct network models that extract more value from existing data. Theoretically, the findings could inform the debate between interaction approaches and network sciences.

Challenges of party institutionalization in a context of political and economic liberalization, where external international donors have become an active part of these political processes, are illustrated through a case study of Zambia. Zambia is chosen as a case because it in many ways presents a 'best-case scenario' for democratic consolidation in sub-Saharan Africa. The political transition in 1991 saw a new party coming to power as the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) won the parliamentary elections with a large majority-over the former one-party rule of the United Independence Party (UNIP). The electoral success of Zambia's pro-democracy movement was in part explained by its ties to civil society, most notably, the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions. The contribution will show that the combined effects of political and economic liberalization, and the political role played by external financial actors in these processes, have hindered the institutionalization of political parties in Zambia. The limited institutionalization, witnessed by weak ties to civil society, a limited membership and shallow organizational structures, provides a partial explanation for the executive dominance that has characterized Zambian politics after the 1991 democratic transitions.",2011"Baum, Scott",Social Capital in Australia: Understanding the Socio-Economic and Regional Characteristics,"DRIVERS OF INNOVATION, ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND REGIONAL DYNAMICS",,2011"McFarland, Daniel A.; Diehl, David; Rawlings, Craig",Methodological Transactionalism and the Sociology of Education,FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY OF EDUCATION,,2011"Verbeke, Willem; Belschak, Frank D.; Bagozzi, Richard P.; Wuyts, Stefan",Gaining Access to Intrafirm Knowledge: An Internal Market Perspective on Knowledge Sharing,HUMAN PERFORMANCE,"This study explores how account managers-employees who operate as entrepreneurial customer boundary spanners-obtain intrafirm knowledge (organizational and expertise knowledge) from diverse colleagues so as to develop tailor-made solutions for their customers.

To investigate this issue, the paper uses a survey inquiring about whether firms are aware of the ties that their main direct RD partners may (or may not) have between themselves. Our results show that responding firms are more informed about their partners' other collaboration projects when the partnership is more directly linked to intangible RD capital, when at least one partner is a public research organization or when the partnership is needed to access a new market. Network awareness is also higher when both RD partners are from the same type (e.g. public research organization, companies, technical centers).

Two dimensions of social capital are investigated-the degree (i.e. size) of individuals' networks of ideation relations, and the structural holes (i.e. gaps between nodes) of those relations. Previous research has presented different and even conflicting empirical results concerning the effect of structural holes on innovation activities, and has not dealt specifically with the ideation phase of the innovation process. By drawing upon an idea database from a Swedish company that has worked systematically with idea management for an extensive period, this study investigates the interrelationship between social capital and ideation. The empirical study reveals that the larger the size of an individual's ego network, the higher is this individual's innovative performance in terms of high-quality ideas, whereas the larger the number of structural holes in an ego network, the lower is the quality of ideas generated by the individual in question. These findings support the conclusion that social capital, in terms of individuals' relationships with fellow employees within firms, has a positive influence on idea-generating behavior. Moreover, the results reveal that the presence of structural holes is negative for ideation performance, thus providing important new input to the recent debate on the interrelationship between structural holes and innovation in general.",2011"Choi, Sejung Marina; Kim, Yoojung; Sung, Yongjun; Sohn, Dongyoung",BRIDGING OR BONDING?

Non-co-ethnic networks offer potentially different views on union formation compared to the families of origin and may thus be relevant for the choices young adults make in this domain. We distinguish between strong ties (close non-co-ethnic friends) and weak ties (ethnic composition of secondary school) and study the effects of these types of ties on four aspects of union formation, namely the timing of starting a first union, the timing of first marriage, the type of union (marriage versus cohabitation) and the ethnic origin of the partner. Using data from ""The Integration of the European Second Generation"" (TIES) survey for the Netherlands collected in 2007, we find that a higher level of embeddedness into non-co-ethnic networks, in particular having many close friends, influences each of the four union formation choices studied. Weak ties affect the timing of a first union and a first marriage. Effects of weak ties were not found for other aspects of union formation. These results points to the importance of social actors outside the family.

Using a computational model similar to earlier studies, we find that ties between clusters facilitate cultural convergence under the micro-level assumptions of assimilation and attraction to similar others. However, these assumptions also have negative counterparts-differentiation and xenophobia.

In contrast, organizations that network with markets and readers tend to adopt more substantial change. Factors shaping managers' decision-making are explored, with a particular focus on the role environmental uncertainty plays in news organizations pursuing connections within the news institution (strong ties) or with audiences (weak ties). Data from a survey of news organizations and an analysis of features on their websites suggest levels of innovation are low, and institutionalist tendencies dominate decision-making about product change. Where innovation occurs, it is due to corporate coercion and resources, and concrete evidence from the organization's market. Uncertainty about audiences and technologies tends to reinforce institutionalist tendencies by encouraging managers to follow present industry trends. Uncertainty does seem to fuel the news organization's internal capacity to innovate, but it does not lead to actual changes in website features.

The Role of Tie Content and Social Networks,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,"Understanding the determinants of creativity at the individual and organizational level has been the focus of a long history of research in various disciplines from the social sciences, but little attention has been devoted to studying creativity at the dyadic level. Why are some dyadic interactions more likely than others to trigger the generation of novel and useful ideas in organizations? As dyads conduit both knowledge and social forces, they offer an ideal setting to disentangle the effects of knowledge diversity, tie strength, and network structure on the generation of creative thoughts. This paper not only challenges the current belief that sporadic and distant dyadic relationships (weak ties) foster individual creativity but also argues that diverse and strong ties facilitate the generation of creative ideas. From a knowledge viewpoint, our results suggest that ties that transmit a wide (rather than narrow) set of knowledge domains (within the same tie) favor creative idea generation if exchanges occur with sufficient frequency. From a social perspective, we find that strong ties serve as effective catalysts for the generation of creative ideas when they link actors who are intrinsically motivated to work closely together. Finally, this paper also shows that dyadic network cohesion (i.e., the connections from the focal dyad to common contacts) does not always hinder the generation of creative ideas. Our empirical evidence suggests that when cohesion exceeds its average levels, it becomes detrimental to creative idea generation.

The focus in this literature has been on two primary outcomes: performance benefits and rewards (including promotion and compensation). These two types of outcomes have often been conflated, however, despite the fact that high levels of one do not guarantee high levels of the other. We examined the effects of job performance, network tie strength, and network structures on the size of the year-end bonuses received by 71 relationship officers in a major, multinational commercial bank. We found that in networks based on information acquisition, both strong ties and sparse networks are positively associated with high bonuses, as is the combination of the two. In networks based on approval and support for one's deals, neither tie strength nor density predicts bonus size, but the benefits of strong ties increase as network density increases. Our results demonstrate the importance of distinguishing networks based on collegial relations from those based on authority, as well as the importance of distinguishing the network factors that improve performance from those that generate favorable evaluations independent of performance.",2011"Matti, Simon; Sandstrom, Annica",The Rationale Determining Advocacy Coalitions: Examining Coordination Networks and Corresponding Beliefs,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,"The contemporary trend within natural resource governance sees a strong increase in collaborative management. A successful turnout of these arrangements is, however, dependent upon the formation and characteristics of advocacy coalitions. Uncovering the rationale determining coalitions is therefore a key undertaking in policy analysis and the advocacy coalition framework (ACF) has been widely applied for this purpose. This article aspires to test several important hypotheses regarding the nature of coordination networks and the formation of coalitions, treating the ACF both as an inspiration and as a framework in need of further refinement. This is done in the context of a complex and conflict-ridden policy subsystem: the Swedish carnivore-management subsystem. The results indicate, firstly, that perceived belief correspondence, and not perceived influence, is the driving mechanism behind coordination; and, secondly, that the catalog of beliefs shared by actors within a coalition is composed by policy core beliefs, in particular, with a more normative content, while no connection between deep core beliefs and coordination is found.",2011"Wadell, Carl; Bergendahl, Margareta Norell",ASSESSING THE CONDITIONS FOR DISSEMINATION OF END-USER AND PURCHASER KNOWLEDGE IN A MEDTECH CONTEXT,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENGINEERING DESIGN (ICED 11): IMPACTING SOCIETY THROUGH ENGINEERING DESIGN, VOL 6: DESIGN INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE","A challenge for many medical technology companies acting in a business-to-business (B2B) context is to develop innovative products that satisfy the sometimes differing needs and requirements of their end-users and purchasers. These companies have to exploit knowledge about both stakeholders in order to maintain an innovative edge. Research to date has largely focused on the acquisition of customer knowledge, in particular on formal methods to acquire customer knowledge in the search for new opportunities. Much less research has considered how companies acting in a B2B context handle and make use of end-user and purchaser knowledge internally. One fundamental prerequisite to disseminate and exploit knowledge about end-users and purchasers in a company is that employees carry out a continuous social interaction concerning these stakeholders. But what are the structures for these dual social networks concerning end-users and purchasers within a company acting in a B2B context? In this article we apply social network analysis to investigate, describe and compare the different patterns of social interaction of end-user and purchaser knowledge in a business unit within a large medical technology company acting in a B2B context. A survey questionnaire was designed and sent out to 115 employees within the business unit, resulting in 86 valid responses (response rate 75%). The aim of the survey was to map how conversations about end-users and purchasers had occurred within the organization over the last three years. The results indicate large differences, both in structure and content, between the social interaction concerning end-users and purchasers. Based on these findings, we argue that medical technology companies acting in a B2B context can, by adapting their approach to the way they communicate end-user and purchaser knowledge, release untapped potential to increase both their innovation performance and their competitive advantage.

This paper tests these hypotheses using data on co-authorship among economists. Our data supports the hypothesis of transitivity of strong ties, but it rejects the hypothesis that weak ties are more crucial than strong ties.

A systematic review",BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,"Background: Gaps are typically regarded as a problem to be solved. People are stimulated to close or plug them. Researchers are moved to fill deficits in the literature in order to realise a more complete knowledge base, health authorities want to bridge policy-practice disconnections, managers to secure resources to remedy shortfalls between poor and idealised care, and clinicians to provide services to patients across the divides of organisational silos. Despite practical and policy work in many health systems to bridge gaps, it is valuable to study research examining them for the insights provided. Structural holes, spaces between social clusters and weak or absent ties represent fissures in networks, located in less densely populated parts of otherwise closely connected social structures. Such gaps are useful as they illustrate how communication potentially breaks down or interactivity fails. This paper discusses empirical and theoretical work on this phenomenon with the aim of analysing a specific exemplar, the structures of silos within health care organisations. Methods: The research literature on social spaces, holes, gaps, boundaries and edges was searched systematically, and separated into health [n = 13] and non-health [n = 55] samples. The health literature was reviewed and synthesised in order to understand the circumstances between stakeholders and stakeholder groups that both provide threats to networked interactions and opportunities to strengthen the fabric of organisational and institutional inter-relationships. Results: The research examples illuminate various network structure characteristics and group interactions. They explicate a range of opportunities for improved social and professional relations that understanding structural holes, social spaces and absent ties affords. A principal finding is that these kinds of gaps illustrate the conditions under which connections are strained or have been severed, where the limits of integration between groups occurs, the circumstances in which social spaces are or need to be negotiated and the way divides are bridged. The study's limitations are that it is bounded by the focus of attention and the search terms used and there is yet to be developed a probabilistic, predictive model for gaps and how to connect them. Conclusions: Gaps offer insights into social structures, and how real world behaviours of participants in workplaces, organisations and institutions are fragile. The paper highlights the circumstances in which network disjunctures and group divides manifest.

However, the extant literature has paid limited attention to the interaction between them. This research draws on the literature on formal modeling of networks to examine the interaction between knowledge codification and knowledge-sharing networks. The analysis suggests that an increase in codification may damage existing network-sharing ties. Anticipating that, individuals may hoard their knowledge to protect their network ties, even when there are nontrivial rewards for codification. We find that despite the aforementioned tension between the codification and the network approach, a firm may still benefit from combining the two approaches. Specifically, when the future sharing potential between knowledge workers is high, a combination of the two approaches may outperform a codification-only or a network-only approach because the codification reward causes fewer network ties to break down, and the benefit from increased codification can offset the loss of some network ties. However, when the future sharing potential is low, an increase in codification reward can quickly break down the whole network. Thus, firms may be better off by pursuing a codification-only or a network-only strategy.",2010"Xu, Yunjie (Calvin); Kim, Hee-Woong; Kankanhalli, Atreyi",Task and Social Information Seeking: Whom Do We Prefer and Whom Do We Approach?,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS,"Employee information-seeking behavior shapes the formation of organizational communication networks and affects performance.

Deriving from the relational communication perspective, informational and relational motivations are modeled as the two main antecedents of source preference and sourcing frequency in dyadic information seeking. Through a survey of employee dyads, our findings indicate that perceived information relevance is a significant antecedent of source preference for both task and social information seeking, whereas perceived relational benefit is significant in the context of task information. The results also show that perceived relational benefit has a stronger effect on source preference in task information seeking than in social information seeking. Furthermore, preference for a source is a significant antecedent of the frequency of sourcing in both contexts.

By analysing 325 survey responses of eight research and development groups from five firms with structural equation modelling, we found that network centrality and organizational reward were influential only on open knowledge transfer while expected reciprocity was influential only on closed knowledge transfer.

This is due to tremendous difficulties in data acquisition of social systems. Massive multiplayer online games (MMOG) provide a fascinating new way of observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously socially interacting individuals engaged in virtual economic activities. We have compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players over a period of 3 years from a MMOG played by 300,000 people. This large-scale data set of a socio-economic unit contains all social and economic data from a single and coherent source. Players have to generate a virtual income through economic activities to 'survive' and are typically engaged in a multitude of social activities offered within the game. Our analysis of high-frequency log files focuses on three types of social networks, and tests a series of social-dynamics hypotheses. In particular we study the structure and dynamics of friend-, enemy- and communication networks. We find striking differences in topological structure between positive (friend) and negative (enemy) tie networks. All networks confirm the recently observed phenomenon of network densification. We propose two approximate social laws in communication networks, the first expressing betweenness centrality as the inverse square of the overlap, the second relating communication strength to the cube of the overlap. These empirical laws provide strong quantitative evidence for the Weak ties hypothesis of Granovetter. Further, the analysis of triad significance profiles validates well-established assertions from social balance theory. We find overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of complete (incomplete) triads in networks of positive ties, and vice versa for networks of negative ties. Empirical transition probabilities between triad classes provide evidence for triadic closure with extraordinarily high precision. For the first time we provide empirical results for large-scale networks of negative social ties. Whenever possible we compare our findings with data from non-virtual human groups and provide further evidence that online game communities serve as a valid model for a wide class of human societies.

Foreignness negatively affects the propensity to form inter-organizational relationships, and the impact of being part of a multinational organization is mixed, revealing complex relationships between inter-and intra-organizational interactions. The findings show the merit of the distinction between foreignness and multinationality, as two defining attributes of MNEs that differently shape their inter-organizational relationships.

The data that this study requires were collected from buyers responsible for supplier relationships in a Korean telecommunication service provider and from their partners.

Specifically, how does the density of informal networks affect an actor's ability to access and integrate diverse information and consequently that actor's innovation performance? The arguments are developed using the setting of 79 senior partners in a global management consulting firm and tested on a dataset of 1,449 informal relationships. I distinguish between internal, external, local, and global relations and find that this separation permits a more nuanced understanding of the effect of network structure on innovation performance. Specifically, I argue that the most effective network strategy is contingent upon the context in which the partners operate. The findings show that partners operating in homogeneous contexts, where the primary challenge is to access diverse information, benefit from low-density networks. In contrast, when crossing both firm and geographic boundaries, partners with dense networks have higher innovation performance. I argue that in such heterogeneous contexts, dense network interactions facilitate partners' ability to integrate the diverse information to which they are exposed.

However, due to its unique complexity, the mechanism of the diffusion in online social networks is different from the ones in other types of networks and remains unclear to us. Meanwhile, few works have been done to reveal the coupled dynamics of both the structure and the diffusion of online social networks. To this end, in this paper, we propose a model to investigate how the structure is coupled with the diffusion in online social networks from the view of weak ties. Through numerical experiments on large-scale online social networks, we find that in contrast to some previous research results, selecting weak ties preferentially to republish cannot make the information diffuse quickly, while random selection can achieve this goal. However, when we remove the weak ties gradually, the coverage of the information will drop sharply even in the case of random selection. We also give a reasonable explanation for this by extra analysis and experiments. Finally, we conclude that weak ties play a subtle role in the information diffusion in online social networks. On one hand, they act as bridges to connect isolated local communities together and break through the local trapping of the information. On the other hand, selecting them as preferential paths to republish cannot help the information spread further in the network. As a result, weak ties might be of use in the control of the virus spread and the private information diffusion in real-world applications.",2010"Farh, Crystal I.

We test this hypothesis in newly developing policy arenas expected to favor relationships that resolve low-risk dilemmas. A stochastic actor-based model for network evolution estimated with survey data from 1999 and 2001 in 10 U.S. estuaries finds that actors do tend to select popular actors as partners, which presumably creates a centralized bridging structure capable of efficient information transmission for coordinating policies even without any government mandate.

We investigate the association between ego-centric network properties (structure, position and tie) and information and communication technology (ICT) use of individuals in knowledge-intensive and geographically dispersed settings. Analysis from data collected using a reliable and validated questionnaire show that task-level ICT use is significantly associated with degree centrality and functional tie diversity; and communication-level ICT use is negatively associated with efficiency. The implications of these associations for knowledge-intensive work mean that it is important to consider the professional social network characteristics of potential users of the technology for designing ICE-enabled organizations. The greater the number and diversity of peers individuals interact with translates into more opportunities to use ICT for context-specific tasks. Results from this study also show that individuals who tend to isolate themselves from peers tend to be slow adopters or low users of ICT. Thus, an understanding of how network structure inter-relates with technology and its adopters proves beneficial in reaping benefits required at the organizational (macro) and individual (micro) levels.

In addition to increasing human capital, participation in such programs may lead to new professional networks and access to social capital. Although network development and social capital generation were not explicit program goals, we took advantage of a natural experiment and studied the social networks that developed in the first year of an executive-education Master of Hospital and Healthcare Administration (MHA) program in Jimma, Ethiopia. Case description: We conducted a sociometric network analysis, which included all program participants and supporters (formally affiliated educators and mentors). We studied two networks: the Trainee Network (all 25 trainees) and the Trainee-Supporter Network (25 trainees and 38 supporters). The independent variable of interest was out-degree, the number of program-related connections reported by each respondent. We assessed social capital exchange in terms of resource exchange, both informational and functional. Contingency table analysis for relational data was used to evaluate the relationship between out-degree and informational and functional exchange. Discussion and evaluation: Both networks demonstrated growth and inclusion of most or all network members. In the Trainee Network, those with the highest level of out-degree had the highest reports of informational exchange, X(2) (1, N = 23) = 123.61, p < 0.01. We did not find a statistically significant relationship between out-degree and functional exchange in this network, X(2)(1, N = 23) = 26.11, p > 0.05. In the Trainee-Supporter Network, trainees with the highest level of out-degree had the highest reports of informational exchange, X(2) (1, N = 23) = 74.93, p < 0.05. The same pattern held for functional exchange, X(2) (1, N = 23) = 81.31, p < 0.01. Conclusions: We found substantial and productive development of social networks in the first year of a healthcare management capacity-building program. Environmental constraints, such as limited access to information and communication technologies, or challenges with transportation and logistics, may limit the ability of some participants to engage in the networks fully. This work suggests that intentional social network development may be an important opportunity for capacity-building programs as healthcare systems improve their ability to manage resources and tackle emerging problems.",2010"Wright, Kevin B.; Rains, Steve; Banas, John","Weak-Tie Support Network Preference and Perceived Life Stress Among Participants in Health-Related, Computer-Mediated Support Groups",JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,"The study reported here examines characteristics of weak-tie support network preference among members of health-related computer-mediated support groups.

Bridging is calculated by systematically deleting links and calculating the resultant changes in network cohesion (measured as the inverse average path length). The average change for each node's links provides an individual level measure of bridging. We also present a normalized version which controls for network size and a network-level bridging index. Bridging properties are demonstrated on hypothetical networks, empirical networks, and a set of 100 randomly generated networks to show how the bridging measure correlates with existing network measures such as degree, personal network density, constraint, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and vitality.

A contrasting line of research demonstrates that triads in empirical social networks are well predicted by lower order graph features (density and dyads), accounting for around 90% of the variability in triad distributions when comparing different social networks (Faust, 2006, 2007, 2008). These two sets of results present a puzzle: how can substantial triadic tendencies occur when triads in empirical social networks are largely explained by lower order graph features? This paper provides insight into the puzzle by considering constraints that lower order graph features place on the triad census. Taking a comparative perspective, it shows that triad censuses from 159 social networks of diverse species and social relations are largely explained by their lower order graph features (the dyad census) through formal constraints that force triads to occur in narrow range of configurations. Nevertheless, within these constraints, a majority of networks exhibit significant triadic patterning by departing from expectation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reviews existing empirical studies on the relationship between social capital and innovation of the individual, team, organization, city and nation. Analyses were carried out to identify consensus, discordances and gaps in the social capital-innovation connection. The findings suggested that the structural components of social capital, including ego network size, structural holes, tie strength and centrality have a significant impact on innovation. Their impact, however, tends to be moderated by contextual and intellectual factors, such as the nature and type of innovation, internal vs external ties, costs of maintaining the ties and existing intellectual capital. The relational components of social capital, trust and cognitive norms, demonstrated a consistently positive relationship with innovation across contexts. The cognitive components of social capital have not sufficiently established their contribution to innovation apart from the other two dimensions.

We have adopted a social practice perspective, which we base within an interpretative world view, to better understand how organisational foresight is enacted. This offers a reading of the phenomena, of which the essential contribution is that organisational foresight is more than an organisational property: it is something that reflective people do as they engage with various inputs from the outside and as a result of the continuous interaction between activity systems and their constituting elements. A longitudinal case study illustrates the importance of understanding the construction of collective and individual meaning in working with organisational foresight. The study shows how the inherent rigidity of the existing activity system and the weak ties between these diverse subsets of the organisation may block the interaction between emerging social practices and organisational intentions resulting in ongoing failures of understanding and enactment. A model is developed to include these parameters in an augmented activity systems model. Based on this we have identified the linking of organisational levels as one of the key dimensions to be considered for which the social practice perspective holds significant explanatory strength.

We found a strong effect for network tie strength and no effect for the Teach-the-Teacher training course on the dissemination of the new structured feedback technique. This paper shows the potential that social networks have for disseminating innovations in health service delivery and organization. Further research is needed into the role and structure of social networks on the diffusion of innovations between departments and the various types of innovations involved. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The main objective of this research is to propose a literature-based framework based on innovation network theory and complemented with C-K theory, in order to analyze the invention/innovation process of inventors and the product concepts in a packaging industry context. Empirical input from three case studies of packaging inventions and their inventors is used to elaborate the suggested framework. The article identifies important gaps in the literature of innovation networks. This is addressed through a theoretical framework based on network theories, complemented with C-K theory for the product design level. The strength-of-ties dimension of the theoretical framework suggests, in agreement with the mainstream literature and the cases presented, that weak ties are required to access the knowledge related to exploration networks and strong ties are required to utilize the knowledge in the exploitation network. The transformation network is an intermediate step acting as a bridge where entrepreneurs can find required knowledge. The transformation network is also an intermediate step where entrepreneurs find financing and companies interested in commercializing inventions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It reconstructs the migration paths of eight Armenian migrant families who arrived in the Czech Republic as asylum seekers during the 1990s and the beginning of the twenty-first century. By examining the narrated stories of the Armenian migrants it shows that social networks formed an important context for employing various migration strategies in all phases of the migration process, and that the meaning and character of migrants' social networks changed over time. In the initial phase of decision-making about migration as well as on their journey, it was mainly weak ties of random acquaintances that played a dominant role. The position of the migrants in those networks was rather insecure. They held a little control over the information they received, but in these vulnerable situations they had to rely on their weak ties, which strongly influenced their mobility. In the arrival and settlement phases the social context of the refugee camp hindered the cultivation of social ties outside the migrants' circle on one hand, and facilitated development of bonding ties among the migrants on the other. Bonding social networks enabled inclusion of the Armenian migrants into various social spheres especially at the beginning of the settlement process. However, the bounded character of these networks was also recognized as excluding them from access to resources of the dominant society and preventing their social mobility in later phases of their settlement. Thus, bridging networks that provide access to certain resources of the dominant society were sought.",2010"Akcapar, Sebnem Koser",Re-Thinking Migrants' Networks and Social Capital: A Case Study of Iranians in Turkey,INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION,"Existing research on international migration has focused on the importance of social networks and social capital in the countries of origin and destination.

Within the latter view, knowledge is understood as a socially constructed and shared resource, and the focus is on the characteristics of the social relationships connecting the various actors and on the benefits these bring to the participants. Even though it is widely agreed that knowledge is essentially social by nature and that social capital does matter to the corporate bottom line, there are relatively few previous studies that have empirically examined the impact of social capital on organizational growth. To bridge this gap, the paper empirically examines how social capital residing in both intra-organizational and inter-organizational relationships of firms is related with organizational growth. The results suggest that contrary to the theoretical claims in the existing literature, social capital has only meagre role in promoting organizational growth.

This research proposes three social network characteristics (tie strength, density and centrality) and examines their influence on the subjective norm construct. As a result, this research not only extends TAM with a social perspective by introducing three antecedents of subjective norm, but also reduces the potential tension that exists between models explaining behavior at the individual level (TAM) and models that explain behavior at the group level (social network).

Yet, the literature is silent on how early adopters of mobile devices overcome uncertainties related to shifts in technology. Based on purposive sampling, this paper presents detailed insights into why and how five closely related individuals made the decision to adopt the iPhone before it was available through traditional supply chains. Focusing on the role played by social networks, we analyze how adoption threshold, opinion leaders, social contagion, and social learning shaped adoption behaviors and outcomes. The analyses confirm that network structures impact the early decision to accept the iPhone; they show that when facing uncertainty, adoption decisions emerged as a combined result of individual adoption reflections and major influences from the social network as well as behaviors observed within the network, and, they reveal interesting behaviors that differed from expectations.

J.; Fernandez Perez, V.",Managerial networks and strategic flexibility: a QM perspective,INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS,"Purpose - The paper aims to study the effect of external managerial social networks on strategic flexibility for a quality management (QM) perspective. External social networks can affect strategic flexibility positively. QM also contributes to developing these networks. However, there is currently a wide variety of alternatives for managing quality in organizations, such as ISO standards or the European Foundation for Quality Management model. Thus, different alternatives will influence the external social networks differently in ways that have repercussions for strategic flexibility. Testing these differences is the main purpose of this paper. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 203 valid responses were classified in three groups: non-QM, ISO, and total quality management (TQM) firms. Then, a comparative ANOVA analysis was performed to test differences among groups. Finally, different regressions were run to test the effects of external social networks (range, size and strength) on strategic flexibility depending of the observed group. Findings - Paper results show that, depending on which QM initiative is implemented in the organization, the effects of external managerial networks on strategic flexibility vary. Thus, in organizations without QM, the range of external social networks influences strategic flexibility negatively, whereas in organizations with ISO standards, this negative effect disappears. In organizations with TQM, the paper finds the positive effect of both size and strength of relations in the networks. Practical implications - The paper facilitates how to differentiate QM alternatives depending on their observed behavior. Originality/value - A new perspective (QM) is observed to test how managerial networks affect strategic flexibility.",2010"Sengun, Ayse Elif",Which Type of Trust for Inter-firm Learning?,INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION,"This study investigates the association between types of trust and inter-firm learning in buyer-supplier exchanges in an industrial cluster.

Although research to date has examined the way in which online interaction affects offline community, the question of how offline interaction affects online community has largely been ignored. On the one hand, these offline gatherings may provide individual benefits for members as the development of relationships strengthens social ties, leading to the creation of bonding social capital. However, these gatherings do not necessarily benefit the community at large as the resources found in weak ties may be sacrificed as attendees favour interaction with one another to the detriment of those that do not attend meetups. Non-obtrusive analysis of over eight years of user activity from a large, active online community suggests that the development of multiplex relationships - relationships maintained both online and offline enhances attendees' engagement with the online community as a whole, strengthens ties to other attendees, and contributes to the creation of bonding social capital. However, weak ties with non-attendees dissolve and bridging social capital is sacrificed as those who meet offline favour interaction with other attendees.",2010"Tscherning, Heidi",A Multilevel Social Network Perspective on IT Adoption,"INFORMATION SYSTEMS THEORY: EXPLAINING AND PREDICTING OUR DIGITAL SOCIETY, VOL 1","Adoption of technologies has long been a key area of research in the information systems (IS) discipline, and researchers have thus been interested in the attributes, beliefs, intentions, and behaviors of individuals and organizations that can explain information technology (IT) adoption. The focal unit of adoption has mainly been individuals and organizations, however, research at the group or social network levels as well as the interorganizational level has recently gained increased interest from information systems (IS) researchers. This recent focus views the world as being the sum of all relations. Various social network theories exist that seek to emphasize different proficiencies of social networks and explain theoretical mechanisms for behavior in social networks. The core idea of these theories is that social networks are valuable, and the relations among actors affect the behavior of individuals, groups, organizations, industries, and societies. IS researchers have also found that social network theory can help explain technology adoption. Some researchers, in addition, acknowledge that most adoption situations involve phenomena occurring at multiple levels, yet most technology adoption research applies a single level of analysis. Multilevel research can address the levels of theory, measurement, and analysis required to fully examining research questions. This chapter, therefore, adapts the Coleman diagram into the Multilevel Framework of Technology Adoption in order to explain how social network theory, at the individual and social network levels, can help explain adoption of IT. As Coleman (1990) attempts to create a link between the micro- and macro-levels in a holistic manner, his approach is applicable in explaining IT adoption.",2010"Mair, Christine A.; Thivierge-Rikard, R. V.",THE STRENGTH OF STRONG TIES FOR OLDER RURAL ADULTS: REGIONAL DISTINCTIONS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL INTERACTION AND SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGING & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,"Classic and contemporary sociological theories suggest that social interaction differs in rural and urban areas. Intimate, informal interactions (strong ties) are theorized to characterize rural areas while urban areas may possess more formal and rationalized interactions (weak ties). Aging and social support literature stresses social interaction as a predictor of health among the aged. Using data from Wave Ill of the Americans' Changing Lives (ACL) study, this study examines the hypothesized differences between informal strong ties and formal weak ties on the subjective well-being of older adults in rural, urban, and suburban areas. Visiting with friends, neighbors, or relatives has a stronger positive effect on subjective well-being for rural older adults than urban. These findings highlight that: a) informal strong ties increase subjective well-being; and b) the effect of informal strong ties differs by region.

Therefore, there is a need to identify people management practices that create a climate for inter-organizational networking. In this paper, we first analyze the literature for factors that affect networking behavior. Then, we proceed to identify the key people management practices we expect will affect these factors and will, thus, positively influence employee networking behavior. According to theory and research, the most effective people management practices for creating a climate conducive to inter-organizational networking are: (1) recruitment and selection; (2) training and development; (3) rewards and recognition; (4) supervisory support; (5) rules regarding knowledge disclosure; (6) time pressure; and (7) collaborative programs and projects.

Bridging social capital, characterised by numerous and varied weak ties, exemplifies a particular type of network that can help people reach their goals and improve their health. This study seeks to contribute to the evidence base on the use of positive social networks for young people's health by exploring the importance of club participation in predicting the health and health-related behaviours of 15-year-old girls and boys across Europe and North America. Methods: Data are derived from a 2005-6 World Health Organization collaborative study, to establish the relationships between different types of club and a range of health outcomes (self-perceived health, wellbeing and symptoms) and health-related behaviours (smoking, drinking). Multi-level logistic regression was used to assess the independent effects of club participation by controlling for gender and socioeconomic position. Data were compared across six countries. Results: All the considered outcomes, both in terms of perceived health and wellbeing and health behaviours were associated with participation in formal associations. The associations are in the expected direction (participation corresponding to better health) except for some particular association types. Conclusions: Participation in formal associations seems supportive for good health and health behaviours in adolescence, and should be promoted in this age group.",2010"Vasta, Ellie; Kandilige, Leander",'London the Leveller': Ghanaian Work Strategies and Community Solidarity,JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES,"In Britain, there is much concern in policy and public discourse about immigrant integration and social cohesion. But how do immigrants themselves perceive the process of settlement in the UK? This question is examined through exploration of the work strategies developed by Ghanaian immigrants in London in their quest to live a decent life. We explore three issues: how Ghanaians negotiate relations of power in developing viable work strategies in London; how those strategies are shaped or mediated by family, community ties and social networks; and how Ghanaians themselves define and live 'integration' and cohesion. Our results indicate that some Ghanaians experience a 'levelling' process in their work lives in London, where they continually juggle between job exploitation, racism and inadequate pay. In addition, Ghanaians maintain strong family and community ties, a tradition carried over from Ghana. Distinct from the idea that weak ties outside one's community are likely to provide the most relevant and adequate information and resources, we found that weak ties within the community provide the same function. Finally, immigrants tend to define 'integration' differently to 'sense of belonging'.",2010"Swift, Michele; Balkin, David B.; Matusik, Sharon F.",Goal orientations and the motivation to share knowledge,JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a model that takes into account both personal and contextual factors in explaining individuals' motivation to share their knowledge. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing from research on achievement motivation and social exchange, it is posited that goal orientations provide a framework for individuals' knowledge sharing by shaping how they cognitively value the costs and benefits associated with sharing their knowledge. It is argued each of the goal orientations is associated with preferences for sharing specific types of knowledge and is that a focus on different aspects of the knowledge provider-recipient relationship. Research limitations/implications - The model provides a possible explanation for some of the inconsistencies in existing knowledge-sharing research on the factors that motivate knowledge sharing as well as expanding understanding of the conditions that facilitate knowledge sharing. Practical implications - For organizations to encourage the desired knowledge sharing, they may need to maintain human resource management (HRM) practices that recognize the different motivations associated with each of the goal orientations.

Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical model was tested through a survey carried out on 152 MBA students of a university in east China, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed for data analysis. Findings - This research proved that both instrumental and expressive ties will facilitate trust and knowledge transfer. Cognition-based trust is not essential when low-tacit, general knowledge is transferred, and the effect of the expressive tie becomes negative when trust is controlled. When transferring general knowledge the instrumental tie is more efficient. However, contrary to the hypothesis, it is found that the effect of the expressive tie is not significantly larger than that of the instrumental tie during the tacit knowledge transfer process. Research limitations/implications - Besides tacitness, future research may consider involving more dimensions of knowledge into the theoretical model. Longitudinal and cross-national studies are also needed. Practical implications - The paper suggests that managers can enhance knowledge transfer among co-workers by enhancing their instrumental and expressive ties. However overuse of the expressive tie is risky The importance of trust construction in organizations is also underscored. Originality/value - The study reminds scholars to pay attention to the role of tie content in knowledge transfer. The findings also help managers to know how to increase knowledge transfer through promoting intra-organizational networking.",2010"Davies, G.

Most feedback is given to frontline employees directly rather than submitted through formal channels. UZnfortunately, employees tend to be reluctant to report such unsolicited feedback. This paper seeks to explore key drivers of employees' willingness to report customer feedback to facilitate organizational learning. Specifically, the paper examines the joint effects of relational social capital, structural social capital, feedback valence (FV) (positive versus negative), and the intended use of information (service improvement versus performance evaluation) on employees' willingness to report unsolicited customer feedback back to the organization. Design/methodology/approach - The paper used two studies. First, semi-structured in-depth interviews of employees across organizational levels in two service firms were conducted to explore the relationships between the variables of interest. Second, a quasi-experimental study was conducted in which FV and intended use of information were manipulated in a true experimental design, and respondents' organization served as backdrop to measure relational and structural social capital. Findings - FV and the intended use of information moderate the impact of social capital on employees' reporting intention. Specifically, the authors found that social capital had a positive impact on employees' willingness to report negative feedback used for evaluation purposes (social capital was less important when used for service improvements). In contrast, for positive feedback, social capital had a positive impact when feedback was used for service improvements (but less so in an evaluation context where staff were naturally motivated to report positive feedback). Practical implications - Firms need to boost social capital to enhance employees' willingness to report negative feedback that is used for performance evaluation, and positive feedback that is used for understanding and cementing strengths. Social capital can be enhanced through increasing trust and a shared vision (through open and frequent communications), and through providing incentives (rewards and recognition) and improved reporting processes, infrastructure, and training. Originality/value - Service employees' reporting behavior of customer feedback received is important but under-researched.

To date, there exist no clear guidelines for using behavioral theory to guide systems design. Our primary objective is to propose a methodology for theory-driven design.

Our second objective is to apply our theory-driven design methodology to social recommender systems, with the aim of improving prediction accuracy. A behavioral study found that some social relationships (e.g., competence, benevolence) are most likely to affect a recipient's advice-taking decision.

It confirms that online social networks are more often used to maintain weak connections but that a subset of users focus on strong connections, determines that connection intensity to both connected people predicts perceptual accuracy, and shows that intra-group connections are perceived more accurately. Surprisingly, a user's sex does not influence accuracy, and one's number of friends only mildly correlates with accuracy indicating a flexible underlying cognitive structure. Users' reports of significantly increased numbers of weak connections indicate increased diversity of information flow to users. In addition the approach and dataset represent a candidate ""ground truth"" for other proximity metrics. Finally, implications in epidemiology, information transmission, network analysis, human behavior, economics, and neuroscience are summarized. Over a period of two weeks, 14,051 responses were gathered from 166 participants, approximately 80 per participant, which overlapped on 588 edges representing 1341 responses, approximately 10% of the total. Participants were primarily university-age students from English-speaking countries, and included 84 males and 82 females. Responses represent a random sampling of each participant's online connections, representing 953,969 possible connections, with the average participant having 483 friends. Offline research has indicated that people maintain approximately 8-10 strong connections from an average of 150-250 friends. These data indicate that people maintain online approximately 40 strong ties and 185 weak ties over an average of 483 friends.

On this view, tacit knowledge is mainly regarded as an impediment to its transfer. This study argues that tacit knowledge, given its social and intrinsic nature, can facilitate the transfer process. Our argument is based on information elicited from a number of scientific experts within the petrol industry. In their daily work, experts regard the transfer of knowledge as sine qua non of becoming expert, since interactions with others are 1) learning opportunities for themselves, and 2) as social occasions on which they demonstrate their social status as experts. Consequently, we conclude, the social and the relational nature of expertise knowledge, as a form of tacit knowledge, can be regarded as facilitators in the knowledge transfer process, rather than a barrier.

Methodology/approach - We briefly review previous international management literature and show that the conception of MNC embeddedness in external networks is often simplistic. We develop the concept of the HQ-subsidiary dyad being externally embedded and derive propositions on how this more holistic concept of MNC embeddedness influences subsidiary contribution. Findings - We argue that subsidiary contribution depends not only on the relational embeddedness dimension of the subsidiary but that there is a complex interplay between several embeddedness dimensions on multiple levels. We suggest that the much emphasized effect of subsidiary relational embeddedness might be contingent on the HQ's own relationships, and the structure of the overall network. We also develop propositions which show that subsidiary relational embeddedness mediates the relationship between overall network structure and subsidiary contribution. Research limitations - For the sake of theoretical stringency, we keep other influencing factors such as MNC strategy and specific subsidiary mandates as constant. Originality/value of the chapter - Subsidiaries are an important source of firm-level competitive advantage. Subsidiary resources have also been shown to develop to a large extent in relationships with external actors. Despite this importance, we argue that our understanding of how the MNC is embedded in external networks and how this in turn influences subsidiary contribution is limited.

The paper conceptualizes destinations as networks of connected organizations, both public and private, each of which can be considered as a destination stakeholder. In network theory, they represent the nodes within the system. The paper shows how epidemic diffusion models can act as analogies for knowledge communication and transfer within a destination network. These models can be combined with other approaches to network analysis to shed light on how destination networks operate, and how they can be optimized with policy intervention to deliver innovative and competitive destinations. The paper closes with a practical tourism example taken from the Italian destination of Elba. Using numerical simulations, the case demonstrates how the Elba network can be optimized.

It is desirable to recommend to users a restricted set of messages that may be most valuable to them. Credibility of a message is an important criteria to judge its value. In our approach, theories developed in sociology, political science and information science are used to design a model for evaluating the credibility of messages that is user-specific and that is sensitive to the social network in which the user resides. To recommend new messages to users, we employ Bayesian learning, built on past user behaviour, integrating new concepts of context and completeness of messages inspired from the strength of weak ties hypothesis, from social network theory.

Prior research examining inter-firm knowledge transfer has focused almost exclusively on horizontal forms of governance such as strategic alliances and joint ventures, whilst research on vertical forms, such as buyer-supplier relationships, is limited. We test the effect of four important relational properties: cooperation, trust, relationship duration and supplier performance. Quantitative data, gathered from 104 UK manufacturing firms in eight industry sectors, are used to analyse the hypothesized relationships through a moderated hierarchical regression model. Our study provides support for the importance of considering relational factors in the transfer of knowledge at the inter-organizational level. In particular, the results indicate that knowledge transfer is positively influenced by the extent of cooperation, but that this relationship is moderated by the level of trust and the performance of the supplier firm. Managerial implications for these findings and future directions for research are then offered.",2009"Rickenbach, Mark",Serving members and reaching others: The performance and social networks of a landowner cooperative,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,"Local forest landowner associations and broader peer-to-peer learning efforts have received attention-particularly in the United States of America-as ways to increase landowner engagement in forest planning and management. Unlike traditional technical assistance and outreach, knowledge is primarily shared among landowners as opposed to being derived from natural resource professionals. While potentially promising, few studies have investigated these approaches. Through a study of a landowner cooperative in Wisconsin, I report on a finding that considers both the effectiveness of a landowner cooperative in the Upper Midwest (USA) and the social network members rely on in decision-making. The former relies on an importance-performance analysis (IPA) of the services provided by the cooperative and the latter on an egocentric network analysis of members with an emphasis on strong and weak ties. Data were collected via a mail survey to which 146 members (81%) responded. The IPA indicates that the cooperative is providing services with which members are largely satisfied. The network analysis suggests that members, through strong ties, discuss their land with on average three others-primarily natural resource professionals (including cooperative staff), as opposed to other members, neighbors, and kin. However, by virtue of membership, they share weak ties with other members whom they see as trustworthy. The extent to which a network perspective might be applied to similar situations is discussed, as are conceptual implications and future directions. The main conclusion is that the emergence of local landowner associations and peer-to-peer learning requires research methods that better capture the social nature of these new directions.

By building on the literature on inter-firm networks and knowledge-based view of the firm, we develop a multi-level model consisting of subsidiary characteristics, dyadic dynamics, and salient contextual factors to explain the inter-subsidiary collaboration for knowledge development and exchange. We bring to the fore the importance of examining multiple dimensions in understanding what predicts tic formation and the efficacy of these ties in creating a knowledge advantage.

J.","Market novelty, competence-seeking and innovation networking",TECHNOVATION,"Studies of innovation networking have frequently been concerned with the occurrence of dyadic relationships and with their apparent impact on simple measures of firm-level innovation outputs. This paper takes a more detailed look by analyzing the connection between different types of innovation and forms of networking. Based on the market novelty of innovation outcomes and the extent to which innovation activities require new competences, four types of innovation are identified. It is proposed that these types correlate with various innovation network dimensions, including the volume of networks, the strength and content of ties, and the specificity of ties. Drawing on survey data of 594 innovations realized by Dutch small firms, it is observed that the requirement to access new competences for innovation correlates positively with the number of network partners involved. We also note more subtle connections between types of innovation and networking, including that novel innovation outputs correlate with using network partners as a source of inspiration, whilst new competences associate with networking for knowledge capital. In the latter case, these activities also draw on new and intended ties relatively often, i.e. network partners which are actively sought out for the specific contributions they may make to the innovation process. Finally, innovation which is simultaneously new-to-the market and requires new competences uses strong ties relatively often. Implications for innovation policy and practice are discussed.

We know little about whether the observed network effect in offline settings also applies to online contexts. In this study we argue that co-membership is one of the most important mechanisms through which online social networks are built, and the network effect is salient for the adoption of ECT. We also document a recency effect with respect to ECT adoptions. Specifically, contrary to traditional wisdom, we find that recent adoptions, rather than more distant ones, are more powerful in affecting subsequent adoptions. Moreover, recent adoptions positively reinforce the impact of the network effect on subsequent adoptions. To illustrate theory and test hypotheses, we examine the adoption of the latest open source software (OSS) version control technology using a panel dataset obtained from SourceForge.net.

Extant research has highlighted the challenges associated with managing knowledge in virtual settings. However, researchers are still struggling to provide effective guidance to practitioners in this field. We believe that a better understanding of individual virtual competency is a potential avenue for managing the complexity of knowledge transfer in virtual settings. In particular, we suggest that optimal knowledge transfers can be achieved by individuals armed with the right personal capabilities and skills for virtual work, particularly when those knowledge transfers are emergent, bottom-up and cannot be specified a priori. The virtual competency exhibited by individuals can be the key to overcoming the constraints of knowledge transfers with such characteristics because underlying competency can facilitate effective action in unfamiliar and novel situations. In this conceptual research, we develop a theoretical model of individual virtual competence and describe its role in the communication process, which underpins effective knowledge transfer in virtual settings. Additionally, we consider the antecedent role that prior experience in virtual activity plays in aiding workers to develop virtual competence, which in turn engenders effective knowledge transfer.

Although existing studies reveal that people with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) rely extensively on personal relationships for HIV/AIDS information, they explain little about how this happens as a social process. To investigate how PHAs and their friends/family members acquire and share network-mediated HIV/AIDS information, semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted in three rural regions of Canada. Interviews were carried outwith 114 PHAs, their friends/family members, and health care and service providers. A network solicitation and chain-referral recruitment procedure was used to delineate HIV/AIDS information networks for participants. Interview data were analyzed qualitatively and compared to Haythornthwaite's (1996) concepts of network-mediated information processes and Talja and Hansen's (2006) collaborative information behavior framework. Findings revealed that participants obtained HIV/AIDS information from their networks through five interactive processes: joint seeking, tag-team seeking, exposure, opportunity, and legitimation. The results of this study advance information behavior theory by pointing to the interactive character of information behavior and introducing new concepts to describe everyday life collaborative information behavior. This research also demonstrates the extensive interplay between health information exchange and the sharing of emotional support.

Operating-level boundary spanners are the primary agents of tacit knowledge learning across organizational borders, and we argue that trust is the primary determinant of knowledge sharing at that level. In contrast, the corporate-level boundary spanners shape the structures and systems of the collaboration and thus affect the extent of sharing that can take place between operating-level boundary spanners.

They are also expected to decentralize access to resources within developing regions that have traditionally reflected an urban male bias. Elaborating upon science, development and social network perspectives, we examine the impact of the Internet in the Chilean scientific community, addressing the questions 'to what extent is Internet use and experience associated with the size of foreign and domestic professional networks?' and 'are professional network resources equitably distributed across regional and demographical dimensions?' We offer results from a communication network survey of 337 Chilean researchers working in both academic departments and research institutes. We introduce a new measure, 'collaboration range', to indicate the extent to which scientists engage in work with geographically dispersed contacts. Results suggest that larger foreign networks are associated with higher email use and diversity, but local networks are smaller with longer use of the Internet. Diversity of email use is also associated with diverse geographical networks. Moreover, Internet use may be reducing the significance of international meetings for scientific collaboration and networking.

Secondly, relational social capital refers to the underlying normative conditions of trust, obligation, expectation and identity that guide actors' network relations. Thirdly, cognitive social capital refers to the meaningful contexts of communication among and between actors, and includes the shared language, codes and narratives used to create understanding.

We observe striking heterogeneity in contact patterns, with strong ties being positively assorted and weak ties negatively assorted by our measured behavioural traits. Moreover, shy fish had more network connections than bold fish and these were on average stronger. In other words, social fine structure is strongly influenced by behavioural trait.

We use life course data from the Family Survey of the Dutch Population 2000 to test our hypotheses. Because the timing of job changes and voluntary participation is known, we are able to test for socio-economic effects of involvement at the time of a job start while controlling for previous socio-economic characteristics. Consequently, the endogeneity problem from which much research in this field suffers has been overcome. Results show that members are more likely to start new jobs which are better in terms of status and earnings than those of non-members.

It has even been shown that social networks can be more important than the existence of formal institutions for effective enforcement and compliance with environmental regulations. However, all social networks are not created equal. On the contrary, the structural pattern of relations (i.e. the topology) of a social network can have significant impact on how actors actually behave. This clearly has implications for actors' abilities to manage environmental challenges. This review aims to add more precision to initial insights and pending hypotheses about the positive impacts of social networks on governance processes and outcomes, by reviewing and synthesizing empirically based literature explicitly studying structural characteristics of social networks in natural resource governance settings. It is shown that significant differences in governance processes and outcomes can be expected among networks experiencing structural differences in terms of density of relations, degree of cohesiveness, subgroup interconnectivity, and degree of network centralization. Furthermore, the review shows that none of these structural characteristics present a monotonically increasing positive effect on processes of importance for resource governance, and that favoring one characteristic likely occurs at the expense of another. Thus, assessing the most favorable level and mix of different network characteristics, where most of the positive governance effects are obtained while undesired effects are minimized, presents a key research and governance challenge.

Data from structured interviews with multinational corporation (MNC) managers, which we explored using MANCOVA/ANCOVA and regression analysis, showed that cross-border and expatriate/repatriate interaction contexts are associated with more interpersonal trust and shared cognitive ground than interunit meeting and project group ones, and the expatriate/repatriate context with more shared cognitive ground than all other contexts. The regression results show a significant relationship between the cross-border team and expatriate/repatriate contexts and knowledge sharing. We also find that affective and cognitive social capital mediate the relationship between cross-border team and expatriate/repatriate contexts and knowledge sharing.

Yet, social interactions also often occur in larger settings, and group-based research has shown group sizes to affect its member behavior. To this end, we set out to examine WOM transmission in a larger context by introducing a WOM responder, whose role is to provide a second opinion to the WOM recipient. In Experiment 1, we find that social relations in the triad play a key role in WOM transmission. For strong ties, the WOM responder showed little difference in willingness to offer a second opinion irrespective of its congruency with the first opinion. Incongruency with the first opinion, however, reduced the valence of the second opinion. For weak ties, the presence (vs. absence) of first opinion-irrespective of its congruency-increased the likelihood of offering a second opinion and also its valence. We demonstrate that the effects could be attributable to different accessibility of needs for assimilation and differentiation as well as of motivational orientations toward other parties of WOM. Experiment 2 takes a closer look at the conflicting motivations of social influence (normative vs. informational) associated with strong ties, and finds both in operation but to a differing degree.

Using data on informal exchanges among investment bankers in the equities division of a large financial services firm operating in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, and the Americas in 2001, we find that network closure in relationships in which the banker acts as an acquirer of information increases his or her performance, whereas closure in relationships in which the banker acts as a provider of information decreases it. We also find that these effects are moderated by the bankers' ability to employ alternative means (such as formal authority) to induce the cooperation of exchange partners in their acquirer role, as well as by the extent to which the bankers can benefit from being free from the control of exchange partners in their provider role. Our findings highlight the two sides of the normative control associated with network closure: control benefits people when they need to induce exchange partners to behave according to their preferences, but it hurts them when it forces them to behave according to the preferences of those partners.",2009"Wasko, Molly McLure; Teigland, Robin; Faraj, Samer",The provision of online public goods: Examining social structure in an electronic network of practice,DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS,"Electronic networks of practice are computer-mediated social spaces where individuals working on similar problems self-organize to help each other and share knowledge, advice, and perspectives about their occupational practice or common interests. These interactions occur through message postings to produce an on-line public good of knowledge, where all participants in the network can then access this knowledge. regardless of their active participation in the network. Using theories and concepts of collective action and public goods, five hypotheses are developed regarding the structural and social characteristics that support the online provision and maintenance of knowledge in an electronic network of practice. Using social network analysis, we examine the structure of message contributions that produce and sustain the public good. We then combine the results from network analysis with survey results to examine the underlying pattern of exchange, the role of the critical mass, the quality of the ties sustaining participation. the heterogeneity of resources and interests of participants, and changes in membership that impact the structural characteristics of the network. Our results suggest that the electronic network of practice chosen for this study is Sustained through generalized exchange, is supported by a critical mass of active members, and that members develop strong ties with the community as a whole rather than develop interpersonal relationships. Knowledge contribution is significantly related to an individual's tenure in the occupation, expertise, availability of local resources and a desire to enhance one's reputation. and those in the critical mass are primarily responsible for creating and Sustaining the public good of knowledge. Finally, we find that this structure of generalized exchange is stable over time although there is a high proportion of member churn in the network. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The greater this confidence, the lesser is the importance of psychological safety in facilitating knowledge sharing.

We propose that knowledge creation relies, in part, on two attributes of a researcher's professional network structure-average tie strength and ego network density-and we provide insights into how these attributes jointly affect knowledge creation. Our study of over 7,300 scientific publications by 177 research scientists working with more than 14,000 others over an 11-year period provides evidence that the relationship between a research scientist's professional network and knowledge creation depends on both ego network density and average tie strength.

Since the pioneering work of Mark Granovetter (1973; 1974), sociologists have investigated the role of social capital in job-finding (specifically, the use of strong and weak social ties to find out about employment opportunities). To date, however, there have been few direct comparisons of job-finding in urban and rural settings (see Lindsay et al., 2005; Wahba and Zenou, 2005). Using data from two major surveys and a qualitative interview project, we uncover several important differences in urban and rural paths to employment. First, we find that both strong and weak ties are used more frequently by rural residents to find a job, while city-dwellers rely more often on formal or impersonal means. Second, we find much stronger evidence of differentiation within rural regions. Long-time rural residents are much more likely to use strong and weak ties to find employment than are newcomers. However, rural residents who used weak ties as paths to employment have significantly lower incomes. None of these patterns are evident in the cities. Together, these findings lead us to conclude that job-finding in rural settings is strongly affected by constraints - in the labour market and in social capital resources - that are not present in cities.",2009"Farooq, Umer; Ganoe, Craig H.; Carroll, John M.; Giles, C.

Social distance on life course markers-age, marital status, and the presence of children-reduces the formation of weak ties. Consistent with the systemic model, each additional month of shared residence in the neighborhood increases both weak and strong ties.

Enticing employees to seek knowledge from KMS remains an important concern for researchers and practitioners. Trust has been widely recognized in many studies as an important enabling factor for seeking knowledge; however, the role of trust in promoting knowledge-seeking behavior using KMS has not been adequately addressed. Drawing upon the extant literature on trust and information technology adoption, this article examines the relationships between the knowledge seekers' trust in the community of KMS users, their perceptions toward the system (perceived usefulness and perceived seeking efforts), and the intention to continually use the KMS. The results reveal that trust in the community of KMS users does not directly affect the employees' knowledge-seeking continuance intention; rather, it happens indirectly through a mediated effect of perceived usefulness of the KMS. Furthermore, we find that trust seems to be a stronger determinant of perceived usefulness than of perceived seeking efforts. Our study thus demonstrates the indirect, but still crucial, role of trust in knowledge-seeking behavior in the context of corporate KMS usage.

The analysis finds that some metrics for networks' influence-size, the prevalence of weak ties, the presence of elites-have a more complex interaction with network structure and individual motivations than has been previously acknowledged. For example, in some contexts additional network ties decrease participation. This presents the potential for selection bias in empirical studies.

The adopted framework draws on different literature threads such as knowledge management, regional economics, planning strategy and organizational science, and is based on the conception of knowledge as a 'club good' of a complex nature, and on a cognitive-oriented definition and classification of social capital, partly based on Nahapiet and Ghoshal's work (1998). Social capital - in its various forms - is seen as an (individual, organizational or institutional) asset which can allow the access to different forms of useful knowledge, bypassing the barriers (secrecy, tacitness, codification) which constitute obstacles to knowledge exchange and absorption. Four main dimensions of social capital (structural-proactive, attitudinal identity, attitudinal openness, and cognitive tools) and three main dimensions of knowledge (declarative, procedural, and conceptual) are defined, and relationships (causal effects and correlations) among them are hypothesized. In order to test the model, an evolved approach for empirical analysis has been chosen, consisting of a structural analysis for observed variables, applied to psychometric data collected among over 800 individuals in the Republic of Latvia. The results allow to accept most hypotheses but point out some unexpected results as well. Whereas structural, attitudinal identity and cognitive social capital are found to have an impact on declarative knowledge, and cognitive social capital is found to influence procedural knowledge, no significant effect of attitudinal identity social capital on procedural knowledge, and cognitive social capital on conceptual knowledge, is found.

S. population for the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics. I analyze the distribution of ownership stakes at both the individual and group levels. Findings - The results suggest that principles of macrojustice, affecting the distribution of resources in teams as a whole, deviate considerably from principles of microjustice, affecting the resources received by individual entrepreneurs. While aggregate inequality increases in teams that have a diverse set of members, the effect is not reducible to discrimination on the basis of individual status characteristics. Instead, the relational demography of teams - characterized in terms of the degree of closeness in network ties and homogeneity in demographic attributes serves as a uniquely social predictor of between-group variation in economic inequality.

We argue that prevalent theories of cross-national ties fail adequately to explain this divergence. Instead, we draw on systems theory to explain the discrepancy in terms of divergent conditions for societal inclusion.

Currently, it is unknown whether social capital contributes to residential stability and reduces residents' propensity to move. In this paper, social capital levels of stayers, movers and newcomers are studied in two recently restructured neighbourhoods in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Using survey data, social capital is operationalised as benefits of everyday cursory interactions, trust, shared norms and collective action. Logistic regression analysis shows that age, length of residency, employment, income, dwelling satisfaction, dwelling type and perceived neighbourhood quality significantly predict residents' propensity to move. Newcomers are more inclined to move again than stayers and other movers. Social capital is of less importance than suggested by previous research; housing features, satisfaction and neighbourhood perception affect residents' propensity to move much more strongly.

In addition to baseline descriptors of relational behavior, the chief goals of this study were to examine the degree to which Last. fm relationships are characterized by homophily (and particularly by shared musical taste), the extent to which communication via Last. fm is associated with other forms of communication (both offline and online), how such communication behavior is associated with demographic and relational characteristics, and whether these variables predict strength of relational development. Results indicate that although Last. fm relational partners exhibit shared musical taste, this shared taste is not associated with relational development.

But often they must coordinate new product development (NPD) through more embedded interactions because of the intricate nature of systems development in CoPS. Although embeddedness can be socially constructed, the rise of Internet and digital technologies have given way to the emergence of a new form of embeddedness - virtual embeddedness, which provides CoPS firms with unprecedented opportunities for learning and scope economics ill the process of NPD. Based on a new typology of virtual embeddedness in organizational space, I posit that virtual embeddedness is a good complementary vehicle to modularity in the management of NPD between CoPS firms.

It has provided valuable conceptual tools for researchers as well as a supportive ideology for those embarking on careers outside the limits of a single organization. It has stimulated a great deal of research in a variety of countries. But, along with a growing number of critics, we suggest that this model has an excessively individualistic bias which views career success as largely a function of individual proactive traits and the person-cantered social networks built by individual action. As a result it has neglected the institutional resources needed to support such careers. In this paper we outline seven different sets of needs for successful boundaryless careers: career counselling, socioemotional support, job performance and entrepreneurial skills, skill transferability and certification, labour market assistance, financial and material resources, and collective voice. We then describe institutions that currently provide at least some of the resources to meet these needs and have the potential to provide more: employers, occupational communities and associations, labour unions, employment and recruiting agencies, temporary worker agencies, community organizations, the Internet, and government at all levels. Employers can play a key role in supporting boundaryless careers by serving as points of reference for independent and contract workers, in particular those who have been their full-time employees. Rather than boundaryless, we suggest that more appropriate metaphors for the new career might be boundary crossing and boundary converging. We call for more research on the role of institutionally provided resources in supporting extra-organizational careers.",2009"Makela, Kristina; Suutari, Vesa",Global careers: a social capital paradox,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT,"Global careers, typically defined as involving multiple international relocations including various positions and assignments in several countries, have recently received increasing research attention. This interest is driven by a growing corporate need for managers who are able to deal with global integration and co-ordination in large multinational corporations. An important aspect of the competency of a global manager is his or her social capital, i.e. the network relationships he or she possesses. However, while the concept of social capital has been widely used in a number of research fields recently, it has received relatively little attention thus far in the IHRM context. This paper contributes to this research gap, and seeks to answer the empirical research question of how multiple international relocations affect the social capital of a manager. Our qualitative interviews of 20 Finnish MNC managers with global careers identified that such careers represent a 'social capital paradox'. Global careers are characterized by a broad and diverse network of both internal and external ties. This breadth and diversity relate to (1) the managers' internal contact networks of weak ties (2) their internal support networks of strong ties and (3) their external networks of both strong and weak ties.

Ubiquitous proximity e-service highlights the collective effort focused on collecting the user group's power as the reference for ubiquitous trust decisions. Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides some theoretical utility support for ubiquitous proximity e-service. The ""homophily"" describes the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others. By highlighting the ""homophily"" of e-service participants, these isolated individuals can be treated as a group with proximity. The main value of ubiquitous proximity e-service utilizes the network effect from the collective effort of interpersonal social network. Findings - In order to leap the trust barrier for users to embrace these ubiquitous e-services, ubiquitous proximity e-service makes it possible for users to collaborate with their nearby user groups to establish a reliable and trustworthy interaction environment. The simulation outcomes for trust decision quality enhancement show a significant improvement in a variety of environment settings. Practical implications - A significant value of ubiquitous proximity e-service lies in the increased possibility of establishing innovative social network relationships. From the interpersonal perspective, unfamiliar strangers can make connections with individuals who are proximal and homoplastic to them. The strength of proximity gives people better chances to make interpersonal connections, including both weak ties and strong ties.

Findings - The data highlight that effective knowledge transfer between E&E units depends on a combination of key drivers, such as social network ties, absorptive capacity, learning adaptiveness, and communication channels. The findings suggest that the search for and transfer of knowledge depends foremost on the applicability of context-specific knowledge rather than its complexity. Research limitations/implications - The focus is on one specific manufacturing sector and specific drivers to knowledge transfer in this sector, limiting the generalisation of the findings. Also, the findings were drawn from a limited sample of In-depth practitioner interviews and did not integrate any outcome measures to successful knowledge transfer in their approach.

Design/methodology/approach - The research design is based on a case study methodology, In particular, two actual technology districts are analyzed, namely Castel Romano and Toulouse, in order to show how they use organizational, and cognitive proximity to acquire external knowledge sources and re-shape their geographical boundaries. Findings - Based on the findings of the empirical study, two main propositions are formulated. The first proposition refers to the negative relationship between the geographical distance to the district actors and the use of organizational proximity as a means for reaching external knowledge sources. By contrast, the second proposition indicates the positive relationship between the geographical distance to the districts actors and the use of cognitive proximity as a means for reaching external knowledge sources. Research limitations/implications - As regards the firm strategic behaviors, it seems particularly crucial to exploit all the three dimensions of proximity, in order to guarantee openness and sustain innovativeness and competitiveness. Concerning policy implications, the local governments should address their actions to help and promote the openness of technology districts and the formation of technology clusters. With this aim, actions should be devoted also to sustaining single local firms that are part of a technology cluster but not of a technology district.

However, dyads do not capture the essence of a network. We posit in this paper that triads are the fundamental building blocks of a network. To begin considering triads in supply networks, we build on two extant bodies of literature - the buyer-supplier relationship and supplier-supplier relationship literature which offer us the context of buyer-supplier-supplier triads. By doing so, we are taking the first step toward cracking the internal dynamics of triads in supply networks. To build theoretical propositions, we apply balance theory and the structural-hole concept. We identify nine triadic archetypes of buyer-supplier-supplier relationships and state key propositions that aid in decision making in supply networks.",2009"Schlager, Mark S.; Farooq, Umer; Fusco, Judith; Schank, Patricia; Dwyer, Nathan",Analyzing Online Teacher Networks Cyber Networks Require Cyber Research Tools,JOURNAL OF TEACHER EDUCATION,"The authors argue that conceptual and methodological limitations in existing research approaches severely hamper theory building and empirical exploration of teacher learning and collaboration through cyber-enabled networks.

One aspect of its management is its transfer from ""source"" to a ""recipient."" Whilst situating the discussion for a dyad, this paper attempts to theoretically synthesize and clarify key concepts involved in such a transfer process. This paper introduces two dimensions that influence such a transfer: ""ease of transfer"" and ""motivation to transfer."" The varying degree to which these dimensions exist in the source and recipient bring in asymmetries. This contributes to knowledge as most studies have assumed symmetric behaviours between source and recipient in tacit knowledge transfer. It is critical to identify these asymmetries in managing tacit knowledge transfer as intervention strategies differ. Appropriately applied intervention strategies not only enable transfer, but also facilitate learning and growth.

However, many organizations have difficulty absorbing these innovations due to a fear over losing control of the innovation process, and a lack of absorptive capacity to understand and assimilate end user ideas. The purpose of this chapter is to review the currently espoused strategies for integrating end users into an organization's innovation process: incorporating user toolkits, strategic positioning of personnel, engaging lead users, and implementing user innovation communities. These strategies were identified in a time when interactions between an organization and its end users interacted through face to face communications.

Many organizations have used this technology to create spaces of virtual learning in which the geographic distance and face to face communication are no longer barriers to promote learning interactions. The intention of this paper is to analyze the operation of a Virtual Community of Practice (VCOP) that belongs to a private university that has several campus around Mexico country. The relations that exist along members of the VCOP, the existing strength between their ties in their social network as well as the relations of support (to share knowledge with respect to its processes) that they have, are analyzed in this paper. Given the nature of our research, we define it as an exploratory one. In order to obtain the data of the members of the VCOP a questionnaire divided in three different sections was design and applied to 30 people in charge of the human resources area. Each of these people belongs to one of 30 different campus of the organization that are distributed in five different zones around the country. We use the social networks approach to analyze the data. Our findings show that the relationships, information and knowledge that participants of the VCOP have, depend on their geographic location. We can infer then that a clusterization in the distribution of the information and knowledge exists. In this sense, it is a fact that all members of the network do not participate in a similar way and they do not contribute uniformly with his knowledge. The data reveal that strategic positions exist along the network and that particular members that occupy those positions represent a detonating that promotes participation. A significant difference exists along the participation of network members although this network member's participation is foster in a similar way. Another important finding that our study shows is the existence of a correlation between the support that a member of the VCOP offers to other members of the community and the people who this member knows. The results indicate strong support for the fact that the greater number of members of the VCOP somebody knows in a face to face relationship, the more support this member will give to them.

Effective knowledge transfer across projects avoids reinventions, enhances knowledge creation and saves lots of time that is crucial in project environment. In order to facilitate knowledge transfer, many PBOs have invested lots of financial and human resources to implement IT-based knowledge repository. However, some empirical studies found that employees would rather turn for knowledge to colleagues despite their ready access to IT-based knowledge repository. Therefore, it is apparent that social networks play a pivotal role in the knowledge transfer across projects. Some scholars attempt to explore the effect of network structure on knowledge transfer and performance, however, focused only on egocentric networks and the groups' internal social networks. It has been found that the project's external social network is also critical, in that the team members can not handle critical situations and accomplish the projects on time without the assistance and knowledge from external sources. To date, the influence of the structure of a project team's internal and external social networks on project performance, and the interrelation between both networks are barely known. In order to obtain such knowledge, this paper explores the interrelation between the structure of a project team's internal and external social networks, and their effect on the project team's performance. Data is gathered through survey questionnaire distributed online to respondents. Collected data is analysed applying social network analysis (SNA) tools and SPSS. The theoretical contribution of this paper is the knowledge of the interrelation between the structure of a project team's internal and external social networks and their influence on the project team's performance.

Even if coded knowledge is easier to diffuse, the role of tacit knowledge is often essential for being able to use coded knowledge. Coded knowledge can even be unusable without the augmentation of tacit knowledge. The role of organizational culture is highly relevant for tacit knowledge sharing, which is social activity, face-to-face interaction and therefore can be influenced only through culture. This paper represents a theoretical research about how the types of organizational culture according to the Competitive Values Framework model are supportive for tacit knowledge sharing. The Competing Values Framework consists of four culture types: clan, adhocracy, market and hierarchy. Clan culture is found to support tacit knowledge sharing all, factors described refer to clan culture values and description. Adhocracy culture is the second culture type most supporting tacit knowledge sharing. Market and hierarchy hardly do so, and organizations willing to increase tacit knowledge sharing will have to increase the presence in their culture of clan and adhocracy types. These findings provide with insights, which put us closer to better understanding what factors to use to change organization in the direction of ""high"" tacit knowledge sharing.

Using social psychological models of interpersonal perception and hierarchical Bayesian models, we find support for this theory in social network data from employees in three organizations: an entrepreneurial computer technology company, staff personnel at an academic institution, and employees in a large information technology corporation. The results suggest that competence may be irrelevant not just when outright dislike colors a relationship.

Unfortunately, little is known about how the role of team leaders determines the team's creativity. Based on a sample of 39 engineering design teams in the space industry, this study examines the effects of leader position within different flows of communication on team creativity. The results indicate that the balance between holding a central or a peripheral position indeed determines the creativity of such teams. Specifically, very central and very peripheral positions of team leaders within the work-flow and awareness network hamper team creativity, whereas peripheral situated team leaders within the information network propel the creativity. In addition, team leaders stimulate creativity when they stay central in the external information network. In managerial terms, the analyses implicate that stimulating engineering design team creativity requires team leaders to smartly limit their involvement in communication and mainly act as gatekeepers to external sources of information.

This paper develops and tests a model of KRS success, including perceived KRS searchability, perceived KRS output quality, perceived usefulness, and user satisfaction, and examines how three aspects of social context (extrinsic rewards, intrinsic rewards, and organizational trust) affect these dimensions of KRS success. Empirical results from a survey of 141 KRS users in China and Singapore indicate that perceived KRS output quality depends on KRS searchability and the social context, perceived usefulness depends on perceived KRS output quality, and user satisfaction depends on perceived KRS output quality and perceived KRS searchability. However, the study provides some surprises: perceived KRS searchability only indirectly (through perceived KRS output quality) affects perceived usefulness, and the social context directly affects only perceived KRS output quality and not perceived usefulness. Our results suggest a four-pronged approach toward enhancing knowledge contribution and reuse in organizations: 1) developing organizational trust; 2) facilitating intrinsic rewards for knowledge contribution, partly through organizational trust; 3) the exercise of caution in the use of extrinsic rewards; and 4) the design of a KRS with a high level of searchability.",2008"Antioco, Michael; Moenaert, Rudy K.; Lindgreen, Adam",Reducing ongoing product design decision-making bias,JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT,"The objective of this exploratory study is to add to our understanding of ongoing product design decision-making to reduce eventual decision-making bias. Six research questions are formulated with the aim to establish if and how functional membership and informal patterns of communication within an organization influence whether and why employees are willing to engage in product design modifications. We selected as a field site for our study an industrial company that had an internal research and product development operations and where the employees were located on the same site. A three-step approach within the manufacturing case company was designed: (1) In-depth interviews were carried out with managers and employees; (2) a survey questionnaire was sent out to all employees involved with a specific product that is subject to potential design modifications; and (3) a post hoc group feedback session was organized to further discuss our findings with the management. First, analysis of the nine in-depth interviews establishes a taxonomy of product design decisions involving four types of criteria; product-related, service-related, market-related, and feasibility-related criteria explain why employees would engage or not in product design modifications. Second, it is demonstrated that functional membership has a significant influence on the concern for these decision-making criteria as well as on the decision to proceed or not with product design modifications. In other words, functional membership influences whether and why employees are more or less willing to make product design modifications. In this manufacturing company, a global industrial player, the differences in concern appear especially for service- and market-related criteria and pertain particularly to the research and development (R&D) and service function. Overall, even though the perceived performance of the specific product under study did not differ significantly among the different departments, it is observed that R&D employees were significantly less in favor of proceeding with product design modifications than other employees were. Third, using UCINET VI software, we provide some explanations for this finding. It is shown that informal patterns of communication (i.e., employee degree centrality) operate a situational opportunity to make modifications to an existing product and a cognitive opportunity influencing the decision to modify product design following an inverted U-shaped function. Ultimately, we derive practical guidelines for an ideal product-team composition to reduce product design decision-making bias.",2008"Montanari, Fabrizio; Silvestri, Giacomo; Gallo, Edoardo",Team Performance Between Change and Stability: The Case of the Italian 'Serie A',JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT,"This article studies the role of stability in team members' relations as a determinant of performance in the Italian 'Serie A' Soccer League.

This trade-off derives from the opposing implications of having redundant (i.e., directly or indirectly linked) contacts. Insofar as egos alters are nonredundant, ego can be expected to become more knowledgeable more quickly. And such nonredundancy can also be the basis for great power as ego monopolizes the flow of resources (including information) between egos alters. However, the very same mechanism that is behind egos power as a provider of resources - i.e., the possession of nonsubstituitable resources on the part of disconnected contacts also implies that that egos alters will themselves be monopolists, thus weakening ego as an acquirer of resources. Furthermore, while the surplus earned from providing resources on monopoly terms is potentially much greater than the surplus earned from acquiring resources on competitive terms, the former strategy carries the risk that socially distant actors will not value one anothers resources. Beyond elucidating the trade-off in the social structural foundation of knowledge and power, our framework also shows how the opposing implications of redundancy are the basis for a broad family of well known trade-offs (cosmopolitanism versus localism; exploration versus exploitation; insider versus stranger; robust versus simple identities) whose relationships with one another and with power and knowledge have not been appreciated. For all such trade-offs, the greater potential returns afforded by nonredundancy are balanced by the surer returns available from redundancy.",2008"Totterdell, Peter; Holman, David; Hukin, Amy",Social networkers: Measuring and examining individual differences in propensity to connect with others,SOCIAL NETWORKS,"The research examined individual differences in people's propensity to connect with others (PCO).

Elucidating the mechanisms underlying systemic inflammation has long been an important topic in basic and clinical research. When primary pathogenetic events remains unclear due to its immense complexity, construction and analysis of the gene regulatory network of inflammation at times becomes the best way to understand the detrimental effects of disease. However, it is difficult to recognize and evaluate relevant biological processes from the huge quantities of experimental data. It is hence appealing to find an algorithm which can generate a gene regulatory network of systemic inflammation from high-throughput genomic studies of human diseases. Such network will be essential for us to extract valuable information from the complex and chaotic network under diseased conditions. Results: In this study, we construct a gene regulatory network of inflammation using data extracted from the Ensembl and JASPAR databases. We also integrate and apply a number of systematic algorithms like cross correlation threshold, maximum likelihood estimation method and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) on time-lapsed microarray data to refine the genome-wide transcriptional regulatory network in response to bacterial endotoxins in the context of dynamic activated genes, which are regulated by transcription factors (TFs) such as NF-kappa B. This systematic approach is used to investigate the stochastic interaction represented by the dynamic leukocyte gene expression profiles of human subject exposed to an inflammatory stimulus (bacterial endotoxin). Based on the kinetic parameters of the dynamic gene regulatory network, we identify important properties (such as susceptibility to infection) of the immune system, which may be useful for translational research. Finally, robustness of the inflammatory gene network is also inferred by analyzing the hubs and ""weak ties"" structures of the gene network. Conclusion: In this study, Data mining and dynamic network analyses were integrated to examine the gene regulatory network in the inflammatory response system. Compared with previous methodologies reported in the literatures, the proposed gene network perturbation method has shown a great improvement in analyzing the systemic inflammation.",2008"Johnson, Fred",Weak Ties and Academic Community,COLLEGE COMPOSITION AND COMMUNICATION,,2008"Coburn, Cynthia E.; Russell, Jennifer Lin",District policy and teachers' social networks,EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION AND POLICY ANALYSIS,"Policy makers increasingly include provisions aimed at fostering professional community as part of reform initiatives.

It is argued that policy, affects whom teachers seek out for discussion of mathematics instruction but that differences in policy provisions lead to variations in the nature and quality of interactions. Furthermore, school leaders mediate district policy, thereby influencing these patterns of interaction. By uncovering the dynamics by which policy influences teachers' social networks, this article contributes to understandings of the factors that foster the development of social capital.

Interview data were recorded, transcribed, translated and coded following the principles of grounded theory. Results. Participants have been using the Internet to overcome geographical barriers and to integrate the virtual world into everyday life. Initial interactions in the online community promote the need for individuals to meet in the physical world with those who have similar interests and backgrounds. Interactions in the physical world in turn help weak tie relationships to develop into stronger ties. Conclusions.

We argue that this conceptualization does not adequately represent most organizations today, in which multiple users interact with multiple information systems within a group. Relying heavily on the theory and methods behind social network analysis, we introduce the concept of multimodal networks to assess both users and information systems as equivalent nodes in a single social network. This perspective allows us to examine the influence of information systems on organizational outcomes as a function of all of the user-system and interpersonal interactions in a group. We explore two different possible mechanisms for this influence: (1) direct user-system interactions by aggregating the strength of all the dyadic user-system interactions in a group, and (2) indirect user-system interactions by assessing the centrality of the information systems within the social network. We survey approximately 600 individuals in 40 healthcare groups to test whether either or both of these mechanisms are associated with two types of organizational performance outcomes-efficiency and quality of care. We find that the centrality of the information systems within the network is significantly and positively associated with both efficiency and quality outcomes, but that the average strength of the user-system interactions is not. Implications are that managers and researchers should examine the wider multimodal network of multiple users and multiple systems when assessing the role of IS in organizations in relation to organizational performance outcomes.",2008"Hahn, Jungpil; Moon, Jae Yun; Zhang, Chen",Emergence of new project teams from open source software developer networks: Impact of prior collaboration ties,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,"Recent years have witnessed a surge in self-organizing voluntary teams collaborating online to produce goods and services.

The focus of this paper is to explore how the collaborative network affects developers' choice of newly initiated OSS projects to participate in. More specifically, by analyzing software project data from real-world OSSD projects, we empirically test the impact of past collaborative ties with and perceived status of project members in the network on the self-assembly of OSSD teams. Overall, we find that a developer is more likely to join a project when he has strong collaborative ties with its initiator.

Drawing on knowledge-based, resource dependence, and relational theories, the authors argue that the impact of a firm's customers on new product development depends on the size and relational embeddedness of the customer portfolio and the extent to which the firm is dependent on one or a few dominant customers for a majority of its revenues. The authors test the research model using longitudinal data on young firms operating in business-to-business markets in six technology-based industries. The results indicate that customer portfolio size has an inverse U-shaped relationship to the number of new products developed and that the more relationally embedded the customer set, the more new products the firm develops. Dependence stemming from revenue concentration has a negative impact on new product output. Furthermore, the authors find that relational embeddedness can compensate for too small of a customer portfolio and can help offset the negative effects of a highly concentrated portfolio. These results make important theoretical and empirical contributions to the new product development literature, helping uncover some of the antecedents of innovative productivity particularly relevant for young, technology-based firms. The results also contribute to the broader discourse on how customers affect new product development.",2008"Boutellier, Roman; Ullman, Fredrik; Schreiber, Juerg; Naef, Reto",Impact of office layout on communication in a science-driven business,R & D MANAGEMENT,"Driving innovation and creativity has relied heavily on new information technologies in the last decade. Human capital has certainly had its importance, but how to coordinate human capital in order to push productivity in research and development without compromising individual initiative is still not well understood. In this paper, we provide results showing that geometry of workspace has indeed an impact on communication patterns and may thus be used as a means to drive both innovation and efficient research. In order to be creative, new knowledge has to be created. Communication facilitates knowledge creation. We try to close the bridge between areas of creation of tacit knowledge and transfer of knowledge highlighted by authors like Nonaka, Takeuchi, Konno, von Krogh and von Hippel with the area of communication patterns pioneered by Allen, Hatch, and Stryker, by considering face-to-face (FTF) communication as a first step for socialization, socialization as a means for knowledge creation. In this article, we compare two different office environments within the same site, same activity, same hierarchical level and same company: a traditional cell office area and a new multi-space office, used by people who used to work in cell offices. We observed FTF communication patterns during 120 h in two areas and measured over 2,000 communication events. We found that people communicate three times more often in a multi-space area than in a cell-space area. We also found that the mean duration of communication events decreased from 9 to 3 min when transferring collaborators from a cell-space to a multi-space. Finally time spent without communication increased from 5% to 29% when going from cell-offices to multi-space areas - leaving more time for people to work and think on their own.

Yet, few studies analyse the joint effects of these constraints on knowledge transfer in a network directly To examine their interaction, this article develops an agent-based simulation and experiment with four different kinds of relations: a sparse network with weak ties, a sparse network with strong ties, a dense network with weak ties and a dense network with strong ties, At the individual level, the study finds that dense networks comprised of weak ties afford more valuable knowledge if information loss is trivial and the cost of initiating ties is larger than the cost of transfer, but that the value of density declines rapidly as information loss increases. At the organizational level, in contrast, sparse networks with strong ties appear optimal for knowledge transfer via social relations.",2008"Castro Spila, Javier; Rocca, Liliana; Ibarra, Andoni",Knowledge transfer in the companies of the Basque Country autonomous community; Absorption capability and spaces for knowledge interaction,ARBOR-CIENCIA PENSAMIENTO Y CULTURA,"This paper examines knowledge transfer in firms at the Basque Country (BC).

Specialist knowledge providers are consultancies, private research organisations and the public science-base (i.e., universities and the government research laboratories). These may be engaged by firms in co-operative arrangement for innovation or as informal sources of information. We find, as anticipated, that amongst other factors specialist knowledge Providers are more likely to be engaged by firms with more open approaches to innovation, those with high levels of absorptive capacity, those with greater social capital and networking capabilities, as well as by those with deeper commitments to innovation. Overall, the use of specialist knowledge providers tends to complement firms' own internal innovation activities and to complement other external sources of knowledge. Moreover, the individual types of specialist knowledge providers tend to complement rather than substitute for one another. Beyond this we find significant differences in the types of specialist knowledge providers used by manufacturing and service firms. Although service firms are more likely than manufacturers to use specialist knowledge providers, they are more likely to engage consultants, whilst their links with research-based organisations, including the public science-base, are weaker. We ask whether there is a case for increasing the extent to which the public science-base undertakes activities that are relevant to innovation in the services. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Methods. - In the survey, 279 general practioners were asked to answer a scenario dealing with these difficulties. Results. - More than a half of the practitioners interviewed approve the increasing role of guidelines in medical practice and say they try to take them into account, but they also say they generally rely on their own medical experience to operate a selection among the impressive set of guidelines they receive. The more they agree with an evidence-based medicine, the more they tend to accept the guidelines as a necessary dimension of their art.

However, empirical findings have not shown consistent support for the hypothesis. We suspect that there are unintended consequences of collocation, which can offset well-recognized advantages of being collocated. To explain these unintended consequences, we developed a multi-agent model to complement our laboratory-based experiment. In the lab, collocated subjects did not perform better than the remote even though collocators had faster communication channels and in-group favor towards each other. Results from the multi-agent simulation suggested that in-group favoritism among collocators caused them to ignore some important resource exchange opportunities with remote individuals. Meanwhile, communication delay of remote subjects protected them from some falsely biased perception of resource availability. The two unintended consequences could offset the advantage of being collocated and diminish performance differences between collocators and remote workers. Results of this study help researchers and practitioners recognize the hidden costs of being collocated.

The strategic navigation from creative exploration to global exploitation through the use of so-called transformation networks is particularly highlighted. The creativity phase requires a creator with visionary leadership. The commercialisation phase, on the other hand, requires technology integration and global marketing excellence. Realising that this requires more than a bright inventor, the creator of Anoto brought in the right complementary assets at distinct phases of the commercialisation process. Our case illustrates how integrator and marketeer profiles were brought into a networked act of entrepreneurship for joint navigation across an ocean of relationships that gave birth to a global standard for digital writing. By combining theories on open innovation and networking, a theoretical framework is developed to analyse the different nature of the networks (or the value creation structure) in which complementary assets can be accessed, transferred and transformed into commercialised innovation. The analysis suggests that the value of complementary assets are embedded in and unlocked by three distinct types of networks: creativity networks, transformation networks and process networks.

This article attempts to analyse the 'corn factor': both the wife-selling self-destructive 'hero', and the ubiquitous presence of grain. Integral to almost every conflict or crisis in the creation, continuation or destruction of human bonds within the novel is the consumption or exchange of seeds, grain or the products and goods made from them. In tracing a path from furmity to skimmity, the article examines what Hardy reveals concerning the impossibility of restoring what has been spoiled. Concepts from the disciplines of political history and economic sociology, such as E. P. Thompson's notion of 'the moral economy', or Mark Granovetter's construct of 'the strength of weak ties', are applied to this market town to demonstrate that bread is simultaneously a staple and a symbol of what binds individuals and families together in society.",2008"Brashears, Matthew E.",Gender and homophily: Differences in male and female association in Blau space,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,"Homophily, the tendency for similar individuals to associate, is one of the most robust findings in social science. Despite this robustness, we have less information about how personal characteristics relate to differences in the strength of homophily. Nor do we know much about the impact of personal characteristics on judgments of relative dissimilarity. The present study compares the strength of age, religious, and educational homophily for male and female non-kin ties using network data from the 1985 General Social Survey. It also compares the patterning of ties among dissimilar alters for both sexes. The results of this exploratory effort indicate that males and females are almost equally homophilous, although religious homophily exerts a stronger influence on females than males. Males and females do, however, differ in their tendency to associate with certain types of dissimilar alters. Education is essentially uniform for both sexes, religious difference is more important for females than males, and those over sixty or under thirty are less different from the middle categories of age for females than for males. The results suggest that males are able to bridge larger areas of social space in their non-kin interpersonal networks and likely accumulate greater social capital as a consequence.

Despite the importance of strategic partnerships, the process by which social capital accumulates within buyer-supplier relationships and contributes to buyer performance improvements is not well understood. Drawing on social capital theory, we develop a model linking positive relational capital, and its antecedents, supplier integration and supplier closeness, to buyer performance improvements. Further, we hypothesize that structural capital, as reflected in managerial communication and technical exchanges, is also positively related to buyer performance improvements. Using data provided by 111 procurement executives from the United Kingdom, we find support for our hypotheses.

We examine these networks from the point of view of the overall pattern of interaction and from an interest in the kinds of dialogues engaged in by participants in the network. We identify an area for further research in a comparison of the dimensions of links that appear to be weaker in these networks, those concerning affective aspects of the relationship, with those concerned with the sharing of knowledge which appear to be relatively well developed.

The influence of interpersonal trust in general and trust in management in particular on knowledge sharing is evident. However, it is not clear how the relationship between interpersonal trust and knowledge sharing works. This study provides a better understanding of that relationship by demonstrating that fear of losing one's unique value and knowledge documentation have a mediating effect on the relationship between trust in management and knowledge sharing. Specifically, trust in management increases knowledge sharing through reducing fear of losing one's unique value and improving willingness to document knowledge. These findings have important implications at both a managerial and theoretical level. For managers, this paper emphasizes the individual's central role in the knowledge sharing process in terms of knowledge documentation and fear of losing one's unique value. On the theoretical level, this study provides empirical evidence for two mechanisms that help explain the effect of trust in management on knowledge sharing. In future research, this study could be extended to include other psychosocial phenomena that enable knowledge sharing in organizations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Tie strength on the operational level, as measured by interaction intensity and intimacy between partners' project managers, was found to enhance knowledge acquisition, whereas the depth and length of firm-level ties did not. Moreover, the influence of interaction intensity and intimacy on knowledge acquisition was mediated by communication quality and fairness, suggesting that operational-level tie strength becomes less relevant for knowledge acquisition when good communication and perceptions of fairness between alliance partners have been established.

The former also appear to have higher probabilities of being employed, in terms of both their higher probabilities of receiving offers and, more importantly, their higher probabilities of acceptance.

This paper highlights the efforts of a Fortune 100 manufacturing firm ( hereafter US Manufacturing) and its management of global IT suppliers. Using a social capital framework developed by Inkpen and Tsang ( 2005), we explore the supplier network at three levels ( structural, cognitive, and relational) and present eight proven practices for creating, managing, and exploiting social capital within strategic alliances. The Inkpen and Tsang framework examines the linkages between knowledge transfer and social capital for three network types: intracorporate networks, strategic alliances, and industrial districts. We use the strategic alliance of US Manufacturing and its suppliers to illustrate salient social capital dimensions and the conditions and practices that facilitated knowledge transfer.

We first develop a model where individuals learn about crime opportunities by interacting with other peers. These interactions can take the form of either strong or weak ties. We find that increasing the percentage of weak ties induces more transitions from non-crime to crime and thus the crime rate in the economy increases. This is because, when the percentage of weak ties is high, delinquents and non-delinquents are in close contact with each other. We then test these predictions using the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (AddHealth), which contains unique detailed informations on friendship relationships among teenagers. The theoretical predictions of our model are confirmed by the empirical analysis since we find that weak ties, as measured by friends of friends, have a positive impact on criminal activities.

On the basis of empirical research, some questioned the assumed benefits of the science park model, whereas others reported positive outcomes.

An important criterion in analyzing the effects of science parks is the level of networking as science parks often are regarded as a perfect location for interorganizational knowledge exchange and collaboration. Different levels and types of networking could be one of the explanations for these mixed findings. The literature on networks mainly stresses the benefits of networking in general, and networking between firms located on science parks in particular. This paper proposes that networks can have both positive and negative effects for firms located on science parks.

The question is ""how do firms face the challenge of acquiring resources and developing capabilities during their day-to-day activities in order to face competition?"" Case study research involving day-to-day activities of a project-firm in a B2B context suggests that social capital - the sum of structural, relational and cognitive resources - built in networks increases the ability to face the challenge of resource acquisition and capability development even during daily activities. A communication network study clearly maps this influence of social capital. More precisely, dominant or powerful employees should be avoided. Next to organizational structures characterized by hierarchy, high and low communications are also not desirable. Moreover, too much trust can harm firms' abilities to develop capabilities when performing day-to-day activities. Even a complete shared vision hinders firms' capability development during their day-to-day activities. This study supports the negative impact of overembeddedness; shows the value of articles discussing the downside of social capital and confirms the paradox of embeddedness: overembeddedness as well as underembeddedness has negative implications for a firm's performance. Moreover, from the research results important managerial lessons can be deducted, such as (1) the basis for performance differences can be formed during day-to-day activities and (2) social capital management is a critical success factor in outperforming competitors. Therefore, managers should be aware of the potential value embedded in their day-to-day activities and relationships based on economic transactions. They can leverage their day-to-day activities and relationships based on economic transactions and consider them as sources for resources and capabilities that can be deployed in their search for a competitive position.

Social network characteristics are theorized to be a key determinant of information gathering behaviors, but social network research has been criticized for: (1) not measuring the intervening mechanisms by which network characteristics are theorized to have their effects and (2) not considering how actors' motivation affects what network benefits are realized. This article addresses these concerns through an empirical study of the actual information gathering behaviors of managers. It posits that individual differences in a personality variable called need for cognition capture differences in actors' cognitive motivation to realize the potential information benefits that exist in their social networks. Results show that network characteristics do affect information benefits, but these effects are stronger for managers motivated to take advantage of them.

A key component in the evolution of social network research on knowledge sharing has been the recognition that information technology (IT) can play an integral role in knowledge sharing networks. A number of studies have found that the contributions of the social network perspective can be extended effectively into IT-based knowledge sharing relationships. We rely upon these observations to suggest that the continued evolution of social network research on knowledge sharing can and should incorporate the IT artifact more intentionally and robustly into its examination of knowledge sharing activities of social networks. In doing so, we argue that the social network perspective on knowledge sharing represents a useful framework and new frontier for information systems research.",2008"Schwartz, David G.; Te'eni, Dov",THE IMPACT OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION ON KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER AND ORGANIZATIONAL FORM,KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT: AN EVOLUTIONARY REVIEW,"It is the transfer of knowledge that ultimately drives changes to organizational form. Historically, much research has focused on the introduction of computer-mediated communication (CMC) as an agent of change to organizational form. CMC has also received much attention as an enabler for knowledge transfer within the context of knowledge management and organizational learning. After examining these two streams of research in parallel, we suggest that ( 1) the perceived relationship between CMC and organizational form runs through knowledge transfer and (2) organizational form in turn drives additional changes in the use of CMC. In other words, the impact of CMC on organizational form is not necessarily direct and can be better understood by interjecting knowledge transfer as an intermediate step. In addition, changes in organizational form can be seen as looping back to impact CMC thus creating a cycle. This paper describes and justifies what we refer to as the CMC Impact Cycle-the flow of organizational change moving from CMC to knowledge transfer to organizational form and back to CMC.",2008"Dolfsma, Wilfred","Making Knowledge Work: Intra-firm Networks, Gifts, and Innovation",KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION,"Exchanging knowledge between individuals working in a firm, between but even within divisions, does not occur automatically (Szulanski 1996). It is not obvious that people exchange ideas, point each other to information that the other might use, or give feedback, even when they have no evil motives for not cooperating in such a manner. As a firm's competitive advantage closely related to its innovative capacity, however, largely based on how it uses knowledge that is already available, the question then is: How does knowledge flow within a firm? What can be done to stimulate or re-direct knowledge flow within a firm? In recent years, increasing attention is given, by scholars in social sciences in general and in management in particular, to the networks of relations between individuals within firms involved in knowledge transfer and development. Consultancies too are scrambling to set up units that can analyze these networks for firms. in addition to the structural issue of who relates how to whom, I will argue that there is a need to look at why relations are established and maintained. This article thus discusses insights from both the literature on social networks and the anthropological literature on gift and favor exchange.

First, we lack studies addressing the effects of social capital on those facets of development that can contribute in making growth more sustainable in the long run, like, for example, human development and social cohesion. Second, it is still unclear what type of networks may exert a positive effect on the different dimensions of development. In particular, the literature has not yet provided a rigorous assessment of the role of strong family ties, that are generally referred to as a form of bonding social capital causing backwardness. This paper investigates the relationship between the three types of social capital so far identified by the literature (i.e. bonding, bridging and linking), and the ""quality"" of economic development, as expressed by human development and an index of social well-being summarizing the state of health of urban ecosystems, public services, gender equality, and labour markets. The empirical analysis is articulated in two stages carried out by means of a multivariate analysis and of a structural equations models analysis. The results suggest that the linking social capital shaped by voluntary organizations has significantly positive effect on human development, but is irrelevant for social well-being. The bonding social capital shaped by strong family ties negatively affects human development, but significantly fosters the quality of life, mainly through a reduction of workers' precariousness. The bridging social capital of weak ties connecting friends and acquaintances follows the pattern of bonding social capital: it is reinforced by strong family ties and has significantly negative effect on human development.",2008"Reagans, Ray; McEvily, Bill","CONTRADICTORY OR COMPATIBLE?

The trade-off, however, is premised on, and representative of a broader tendency to treat, brokerage and closure as contradictory network forms. We challenge this assertion and propose a theory of knowledge sharing with brokerage and closure as compatible and complementary.

However, few attempts have been made to investigate the explanatory power of policy networks using the tools and theoretical concepts provided by social network analysis (SNA). This paper aims to address this need by determining if a relationship exists between the structural features of policy networks, their organizing capacities, and their performance. A comparative case study of four networks within the higher education policy sector confirms the assumption related to the existence of such a relation. It is proposed that an efficient and innovative policy network consists of a heterogeneous set of actors that are centrally and densely integrated. Furthermore, while the level of network heterogeneity is positively related to the function of resource mobilization in the process of policymaking, the level of centralized integration promotes the function of prioritizing. These findings are believed to contribute to our understanding of policymaking in contemporary society. The current paper indicates that a significant explanatory power exists in the concept of policy networks and that SNA is one way of advancing its possibilities.",2008"Kijkuit, Bob; van den Ende, Jan",With a Little Help from Our Colleagues: A Longitudinal Study of Social Networks for Innovation,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION & MANAGEMENT, VOLS I AND II","In this paper we investigate the dynamics of networks of employees in the front end (FE) of the new product development process.

To test our assumptions, we mapped the full networks of 17 ideas for new product development projects over time in a longitudinal study in two research laboratories. For specific phases of the front end, we found confirmation of our expectations with respect to the advantage of large networks, strong ties and seniority of participants to the networks.

One of the most important implications of these changes is the expansion of resources and products that are globally tradable, highlighting the importance of knowledge as the key economic resource of lasting competitive advantage. As a consequence of this shift in the economy, an increasing number of industries are moving from the closed innovation model to the open innovation model that created porous boundaries between the innovative company and its surrounding environment, changing the inter- and intra-organizational modes of coordination. In an environment where knowledge is the key economic resource and the open innovation model is applied in more and more industries, we are experiencing the increasing importance of the New Technology-Based Firm (NTBF). NTBFs face a number of difficulties mainly associated with a lack of resources and entrepreneurial skills and in order overcome the difficulties NTBFs strive towards flexibility while accelerating the development and commercialization processes by creating and/or entering business networks. By adopting a knowledge-based view for NTBFs and consequently placing knowledge in the centre of a systemic innovation model, knowledge networks constitute an asset for NTBFs. As this new form of cooperation takes multiple and often unpredictable forms it is thus essential to develop strategy formulation tools and processes that can help NTBFs to face their challenges. Until now little attention has been given to the development of strategy tools and processes tailored for the requirements of NTBFs. The present paper presents a concept to cope with NTBFs' by developing a generic process for strategy formulation. In this respect, an action research project was initiated. The proposed concept was initially designed, although not exclusively, for a Greek NTBF, Astrofos Ltd. The author, who is coordinator of the incubator where Astrofos is sited, is acting as-a strategy consultant for the firm and has taken part in all its major decisions since summer 2007. In order to build the strategy formulation process, this paper proposes a mapping technique that attempts to depict a NTBF's tangible and intangible transactions as well as the strength of ties between the focal NTBF and its partners and the complexity of the knowledge. In developing the mapping technique, we have used a combination of the concept of weak ties, derived from social network analysis, with the notion of complex knowledge, as this combination was initially proposed by Hansen (1999). Additionally, a set of questions is proposed that have to be answered in order to pass from knowledge identification to knowledge transfer, from a strategic point of view. In this regard, the presented methodology constitutes an effort, on the one hand, to study the emergent patterns in what is considered to be a chaotic or disordered system and, on the other, to stimulate the creation of new patterns in the system that would be consistent with the NTBF's strategy.",2008"Bettoni, Marco; Schiller, Gabriele; Bernhard, Willi",Weak ties cooperation in the CoRe knowledge network,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,"How to implement a collaborative knowledge strategy under conditions of weak ties? This paper will first explain how came that we faced this question in the research department of our university, then tell the story of how we are answering it by means of a new kind of knowledge network called ""CoRe"" and finally reflect on lessons we are learning about weak ties cooperation. The Swiss Distance University of Applied Sciences is organized in a radically decentralized way combined with traditional hierarchical structures and functional divisions. This has led to an insufficient level of interactions between geographically distributed university members (academic staff, students) so that weak ties have become the norm. In research one major consequence was that research activities were too much isolated in the departments, human resources were dispersed and research knowledge did not flow enough. Projects were small and less recognised, know how got easily lost and research tools' development was too slow. How to meet the challenge of improving research performances under conditions of weak ties like these? Our approach consisted in a collaborative knowledge strategy: to create and cultivate CoRe, an intra-organizational knowledge network of researchers (academic staff, students) organized as a community of practice connecting its members around the common task of stewarding research knowledge. This paper provides first an overview of how we are designing, implementing and cultivating the CoRe knowledge network and then reflections on the new subject of weak ties cooperation as realized in CoRe. In the first part, after introducing the background of the CoRe project as well as our approach to knowledge cooperation we will present the development process and focus on the evolution of the network requirements by comparing the initial and a revised version. In both cases these requirements were collaboratively developed by the network members in two large events: a) the network launch, a future search event (June 2006) and b) the 1(st) Annual CoRe Conference (June 2007). Based on an analysis of the evolution between these two versions, in the second part our paper will provide reflections and key lessons learned about how to design and implement a collaborative knowledge strategy which is able to foster knowledge cooperation under conditions of weak ties.

This paper finds that how matters become subjects of decision-making is at least as important part of municipal decision-making as how they are formally decided on. Both the progression of the process and the actual content of the decisions are largely resolved in preparation. The complex and rapidly changing operational environment is imposing special requirements, which are driving the municipal sector implementing new kinds of patterns. The paper deems it important that, alongside effective issues, municipal administration also strives to transcend conventional truths, search for new ideas from various non-interrelated sources, and create new possibilities from them. The paper engages with the knowledge management research tradition because the success of municipality is considered to be dependent on how efficiently the municipality can balance knowledge exploitation with knowledge exploration. Rather than focusing on administrative structures, the paper concentrates on the official and unofficial interaction processes within the preparation system, and between the preparation system and its environment, The paper finds that the interaction processes have hidden potential, which can be translated into a resource for balancing effectiveness and innovativeness. The resulting complexity-based framework, which can be seen as the main contribution of this paper, shows that paying attention to the interrelationships between the various actors and invisible dynamics of the preparation system provides a new perspective on the challenges facing municipal preparatory work. The complexity-based framework can be seen as an 'enabling structure' that facilitates the running of the preparation system and simultaneously ensures the co-evolution between the preparation system and the surrounding environment. This framework consists of five dimensions, which are: (i) interaction and feedback, (ii) trust, (iii) internal mechanisms, (iv) diversity, and (v) sense of timing and coevolution. The complexity-based framework helps to understand how municipal communities can benefit from their internal and external knowledge reserves and adapt to changes in the operating environment.",2008"Miyamoto, Takuya; Hattori, Yasuhiro; Yatera, Akiyuki",The relation of rotation and knowledge transfer: A study of the R&D activities of a Japanese manufacturer,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,"Japanese manufacturers have competitive strength particularly in the electronics and automobile industries. Moreover, Japanese manufacturers have efficient knowledge sharing practices. Therefore, we can state that Japanese manufacturers possess competitive strength from a knowledge-based view (KBM). In order to investigate the origin of this competitive strength pertaining to knowledge, which is evident in Japanese manufacturers, this paper sheds light on the rotation of personnel with regard to the research and development of forefront technology. We procured the rotation data of all the engineers (N = 1350) assigned to the central research institutes of a Japanese manufacturer. The central research institutes consisted of the material, mechatronics, e-component, and multimedia research institutes. In addition to utilizing this quantitative data, we interviewed the R&D director of the company who was familiar with all of its R&D activities. First, we analysed each research institute in 1998 based on the following criteria, and subsequently analysed each engineer's rotation term: (1) the number of engineers who had worked in the planning departments, (2) the number of engineers who had worked in the basic research institute, and (3) the number of engineers who had worked in the product development departments. Furthermore, based on the data obtained from the interviews, we were able to infer as follows. First, engineers from the planning departments play an important role in accessing the expertise of other organizations. Second, engineers from the basic research institute play a significant role in evaluating external expertise by utilizing the professional networks to which they belonged in the basic research institute. Finally, engineers from the product development departments play a crucial role in adapting the research in forefront technology to the market needs. The rotation of personnel facilitates knowledge transfer. This is because the rotated personnel bring with them new values, ideas, knowledge, and networks. In this paper, we discuss an adequate rotation policy by analysing two successful and unsuccessful research institutes. Our research subject was a large Japanese manufacturer. We revealed that the successful research institutes conducted adequate knowledge transfer through adequate rotation. Japanese manufacturers are well known as high-performance knowledge-sharing companies with strong networks.

This new structure consists of a pair of central egos and their direct links with alters, instead of just one central ego as in the egocentered networks or multiple egos as in complete networks. The key point in this kind of network is that ties exist between the central pair of egos and between them and all alters, but the ties among alters are not considered. Duocentered networks can also be considered as a compromise between egocentered and complete networks. Complete network measurements are often costly to obtain and tend to contain a large proportion of missing data (especially for peripheral actors). Egocentered network data are less costly but a lot of information is lost with their use when a pair of individuals is the relevant unit of analysis. From the definition of duocentered networks, we develop new social network measures, some of which based on the measures for complete networks such as degree, closeness centrality or density, both absolute and relative, while others are tailored to dealing with specific characteristics of the duocentered network structures. The proposed measures are used in the analysis of the networks of Slovenian PhD students and their supervisors. We specify three regression models to predict PhD student's academic performance on the basis of these duocentered network measures for different relations such as advice, collaboration, emotional support, and trust. The results show that absolute duocentered measures predict performance best. When compared with egocentered network measures a higher predictive power of duocentered networks is revealed.

James; Timmer, Vic R.",Transfer of knowledge on agroforestry management practices: the structure of farmer advice networks,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,"Access to knowledge on farm management practices is essential for the maintenance of productive agroforestry systems. Farmers who lack the means to acquire farming knowledge from formal sources often rely on information within their informal social networks. However, little research has explored the explicit structure of farmer communication patterns. We examined advice network structures by using farmer attributes, i.e., kin relationships, community involvement, and imitation, to characterize structural positions and investigated the consequences of such structure on farming practices in cocoa agroforestry systems in Ghana, West Africa. Furthermore, we used a multicommunity approach; we constructed networks for four communities to increase replication and enhance the generality of our conclusions. A high density of advice ties occurred among a small group of farmers, indicating a coreperiphery structure. Settler farmers composed 73% of core position members, suggesting that social proximity did not control the formation of informal advice structures. Because core farmers were highly participative in community activities, the promotion of community involvement may facilitate the movement of knowledge and social exchange to strengthen informal networks. Farmers in both core and peripheral structural positions indicated that they observed fellow farmers and subsequently adopted their practices. Of highly sought farmers, 84% used external information, predominately from government institutions, thus functioning as bridging links between formal and informal networks. Both external and farmer-derived sources of knowledge of agroforestry practices were transferred through informal advice networks, providing available information throughout the farming community, as well as a foundation for community-based adaptive management.",2007"Huang, Ming-Hui; Wang, Eric T. G.; Seidmann, Abraham",Price mechanism for knowledge transfer: An integrative theory,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS,"Knowledge transferred in the open market via a price mechanism enjoys the benefits of avoiding internal competition, learning from external competitors, and accumulating diversified knowledge. In the market, users can access a repository of knowledge for a single price (repository pricing) or knowledge items in the repository can be sold individually (knowledge pricing). However, users have been found to prefer repository pricing but not the knowledge in the repository. This irrationality can cause market failure because users derive a suboptimal level of utility from the knowledge repository, and vendors have contradictory pricing and knowledge strategies. We empirically examine a joint explanation from two competing theoretical perspectives that accounts for this inconsistency nicely: The mental accounting perspective endorses repository pricing because it entices users with the benefits of the whole repository, whereas the transaction decoupling perspective finds expression in individually priced knowledge because it prevents the discrete benefit of knowledge from becoming obscure. By integrating the two theoretical perspectives and considering price, knowledge, and user characteristics simultaneously, the results offer important implications for the market transfer of knowledge. Repository pricing attracts users and is essential to initiate the transfer process, whereas knowledge pricing generates knowledge preference and is thus an effective approach for learning.",2007"Ng, Desmond W.",A modern resource based approach to unrelated diversification,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES,"For over three decades, the questions of how and why an organization diversifies into related and unrelated businesses have drawn the attention of strategy scholars. However, explanations of unrelated diversification have been less than clear. A conceptual model of unrelated diversification is thus proposed. In drawing on Penrose's (1959) resource based approach, unrelated diversification is explained by an organization's 'three pillars, which consist of its strength of dynamic capabilities, absorptive capacity, and weak ties. The role of the three pillars is to discover new resource applications or uses in conditions of market failure that are characterized by 'incomplete' markets. A novel feature of this model is that an organization can diversify more broadly than predicted by Penrose (1959) and other modern resource-based approaches (Teece et al., 1997). Furthermore, unrelated diversification can be beneficial.

HOW SOCIAL NETWORKS AFFECT ENTREPRENEURIAL TEAM FORMATION AND SEARCH",STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP JOURNAL,"The social network perspective has become an important analytical lens for understanding strategic actions among entrepreneurs. Social theorists offer two competing visions of networks' configurations: one of infinite opportunities for individuals to develop heterogeneous circles of affiliations and the other of constrained opportunities privileging only certain individuals. We draw on this tension to describe three models of network formation - random, small world, and truncated scale free - and apply them to entrepreneurial team formation and resource mobilization strategies undertaken by entrepreneurs. We compare and contrast two models of team formation - a rational process model and an interpersonal relations model - and identify the network contexts under which each is most applicable. Mundane entrepreneurial teams arise within localized clusters and appear unlikely to take advantage of what network theorists have called small world networks, which depend upon bridging ties between clusters. Nonetheless, there are entrepreneurial strategies through which new ventures might achieve the advantages of small world networks. To the extent that new ventures emerge in truncated scale free networks, their founders must work within a highly centralized structure, with its institutionalized standards making team formation and entrepreneurial search more instrumental than within small worlds.

In contrast, sharing personal advice improved work quality and signaled competence, but did not save time. Beyond the content of the knowledge, process costs in the form of document rework and lack of advisor effort negatively affected task outcomes.

This paper considers the development of business relationships in terms of the continuing co-evolution of trust and information exchange and the issues associated with researching these processes. The interconnections of trust and information exchange are examined in a survey of business relationships involving information exchange (n=355). Analysis of variance shows few, if any, of the aspects of the standard conceptualizations of information exchange are associalted with increased levels of trust. It is information exchange norms that have the greatest (positive) association with the level of trust. These norms emerge as part of the long term co-production of the relationship itself. This has important managerial implications. We conclude there are few managerial actions involving managing communication that can ""manufacture"" trust and improve or develop relationships in the short term. The paper concludes with a discussion of alternative ways of envisaging communication and relationship management and the nature and future of research into the evolution of business relationships.

The preservation or dissolution of an embedded tie depends ultimately on two specific tie contingencies, the balance of power between the target firm and the embedded relation and interpretive processes at the interface between the two. Our findings have implications for the study of the dissolution of market ties by pointing to different roles played by social and institutional forces, power asymmetries and competition in the dynamics of embedded ties.

To achieve effective knowledge sharing, it is important to encourage workers to share their knowledge for the best interests of the firm. However, successfully exerting this encouragement. is very challenging. In this paper, we develop a formal model and analyze reward systems for intra-organizational knowledge sharing. Specifically, two common forms of reward systems are considered; individual-based reward which is based on the individual contribution of valuable knowledge, and group-based reward which is based on the contribution of the whole group through knowledge sharing to the firm performance. Through the analysis, we derive a simple optimal individual-based reward system which depends on the amount and the productivity of shared knowledge. The system balances the benefit from knowledge sharing of each worker with the costs related with it. Next, it is found that group-based reward is not only less efficient than individual-based reward, but it also subject to a potential productivity problem, in which workers with more productive knowledge do not participate in knowledge sharing. Finally, it is shown that several organizational factors can complement reward systems in increasing the performance of KM and can mitigate the productivity problem. Insights from our analysis could help managers to understand important considerations in rewarding knowledge sharing, and could provide them with guides to implement reward systems.

We also use the concept of link overlap to measure the number of common neighbours any two adjacent nodes have, which serves as a useful local measure for identifying the interconnectedness of communities. We report a positive correlation between the overlap and weight of a link, thus providing strong quantitative evidence for the weak ties hypothesis, a central concept in social network analysis.

We argue that socially communicated cues may be particularly consequential for women because they tend to know less about the parties and their platforms than men do. Accordingly, casual acquaintances can be an important source of new information for women. Women with more diverse ties to other women, we argue, are more likely to encounter women who are voting for the party of the Left and to recognize their shared interest in voting similarly. Our second hypothesis builds on Susan Carroll's argument that women require sufficient autonomy to express their gender-related interests in their choice of party. We argue that married women's political autonomy can be enhanced if their social networks include a range of women who do enjoy such autonomy. Ties with higher-status women can be a source of psychological resources that facilitate voting for a party of the Left.

Other authors concentrate on the relationship between neighbourhood attachment and participation. However, an empirical analysis in which both factors are combined is lacking.

The findings show that participation is greater for residents with social networks in the neighbourhood, who reject deviant behaviour, and have a stronger neighbourhood attachment.

For a test of this hypothesis, we distinguish between friendship circles and strategy-influence circles. We find that friendship circle membership is positively associated with attitudes that display empathic concern but negatively with more instrumental attitudes, whereas strategy- influence circle membership is positively associated with attitudes that display long-term ambition but negatively with attitudes that display short-term calculation. Second, we argue and find that membership of social circles affects individual performance (social circles foster the exchange of information, for which we find clear evidence), albeit not necessarily in a linear fashion.

By doing so, he highlights the relative importance of the bridging and bonding aspects of social capital that vary during different phases because of the different types of knowledge that become more or less important over the lifecycle of the project - embrained, embodied, encultured, embedded, and encoded.",2007"Raz, Ornit; Gloor, Peter A.",Size really matters - New insights for start-ups' survival,MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"This paper presents new evidence regarding a firm's probability for survival, based on the network structure of the firm's managers.

Original data have been collected from Israeli software start-ups during the dot-com economic growth. About eight years later, we added information about their ability to survive the burst of the dot-com. bubble. From a theoretical point of view, this paper highlights the power of the classic social networks approach in explaining organizational performance.

Theories that emphasize the role of proximity and tacit knowledge in innovation processes highlight the importance of social interaction and networking for the diffusion of knowledge. A concept that captures the impact of human relations on economic activity is social capital. Using factorial analysis with data from the European Values Study (EVS), the multidimensionality of social capital is demonstrated empirically. The obtained independent dimensions serve as inputs in a knowledge production function estimated for a sample of European regions. One of the major results is that the impact of social capital on regional innovation processes is significant and comparable with the importance of human capital. However, not all dimensions of social capital exhibit the same explanatory power. The dimension 'Associational Activity' represents the strongest driving force for patenting activity. Hence, empirical evidence for the significance of weak ties in innovative processes is given.",2007"Khodyakov, Dmitry",Trust as a process: A three-dimensional approach,SOCIOLOGY-THE JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH SOCIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION,"What is trust?

Thus a variety of soil fertility management technologies have been promoted to help sustain fertility levels of soils in Tororo district by INSPIRE project. However, despite these efforts, there is low adoption of these technologies. Various studies indicate that social capital is crucial for adoption of soil fertility management technologies as it provides social networks, relationships and linkages that enable poor people to cooperate, coordinate, share information and resources, and act collectively. Social capital is the ties, networks and linkages between individuals, groups and communities that bind and bridge society. A survey involving structure questionnaire, focus group discussion and participatory diagramming (network analysis) was conducted with 103 female and male farmers in two sub-counties, Usukuru and Kisoko in Tororo District to investigate the levels and dimensions of social capital and their influence on adoption of soil fertility management technologies. Logit regression model results showed that the probability of currently using legume cover crops (tithonia biomass transfer, canarvalia, tephrosia and mucuna was higher for farmers who belonged to groups compared to other community members. Social capital variables such as the extent of cooperation, the extent of information sharing, and linkages with external agencies significantly increased the probability of adoption of these legume cover crops. Farmers' groups performed better on such indicators of social capital as cooperation, extent of trust, information sharing and participation in collective activities. On the other hand, indicators of weak ties such as selfishness, individualism and conflict are higher in the general community than farmer's groups. There was higher adoption in farmers groups implying that social capital influences adoption of technologies. It is therefore recommended that strengthening local organizations and intensifying multipurpose cover crops would increase adoption of soil fertility management technologies.",2007Zhang Shoukui; Dang Xinghua,Study on the impact of relationship-structure and relationship-quality on enterprises' effective knowledge acquisition,"ADVANCES IN MANAGEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY, PROCEEDINGS","In cooperation Innovation findings, researchers did not distinguish between relationship -structure and relationship-quality in inter-enterprises.

Resources needed to realize desired goals are furthermore shaped by exchange relationships that build social capital. These considerations are empirically applied to explanations of the intentions of 758 Polish men and women ever to have a first, second, or third child. Personal networks are especially relevant for the considerations to have a first or second child. The intentions of childless respondents are positively influenced by network partners who are at a similar stage of their reproductive biographies or who have already taken the step of having a first child.

The purpose of this study is to explore the health information seeking behaviour of African-Americans using Granovetter's strength of weak ties as the theoretical framework. Method. A listed household telephone survey of 216 residents who reside on the Near East Side of Buffalo, New York. Using the Rand() feature in MS Excel a random sample was drawn from the telephone numbers randomly selected from census tracts covering the target area. Random samples were drawn three times until at least 200 telephone surveys were completed. Analysis. Data analysis was completed using SPSS 13.0 for Windows. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed along with analysing descriptive statistics and the chi-squared test to determine the association between the source of health information as related to demographics and tie strength between individuals. Results. Overall, most respondents rely on a health service professional for health information followed by a web site. Respondents reported having a 'somewhat close' relationship with health care professionals as compared to having a 'very close' relationship with family members. The importance of health service professionals as a significant or weak tie in health information seeking is consistent with the strength of weak ties theory. Results on proxy searching behaviour or searching on behalf of another person are also examined. Most respondents sought information for themselves, although 22.2 percent sought health information on behalf of another person. Conclusions. These findings confirm the important role of health service professionals in health information seeking by under-served populations and suggest the need for investigation on the information giving behaviour of these professionals. These findings also demonstrate the need for further research on strong ties or close family and friends as a source of health information, in particular their role in proxy health information behaviour.",2007"Harryson, Sigvald; Kliknaite, Sandra; Dudkowski, Rafal",Making innovative use of academic knowledge to enhance corporate technology innovation impact,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT,"This paper reviews 100 papers on the topic of Industry-University (I/U) collaborations to identify the drivers and main-barriers to such collaborations.

Entrepreneurs are important to regional economy in the course of extending social networks and accumulating social capital, which brings technology innovation advantage to corporations and increases competitive ability. Entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, exploitation and innovation activities of opportunity pursue are important components of entrepreneurship in clusters. Successful opportunity identification and exploitation are associated with the existence and use of an extended social network.

At last, based on the perspective of social networks, the author proposed a entrepreneurial opportunity recognition and exploitation model in industrial clusters. We pointed out that dense networks and strong ties can stimulate trust and diffuse of tacit and sensitive information, accelerate flow of information and knowledge, which can be propitious to opportunity exploitation. On the other hand, sparse networks, weak ties and structural hole can help to acquire hot news and information, extend networks, increase the efficiency of information and knowleage flow, which can be propitious to opportunity recognition.

Frequently, ideas and information are dispersed over globally distributed organizations or team members. As a result, the exchange of knowledge has become not only very important for innovation but also highly complex. To facilitate this knowledge exchange, electronically mediated interactions are growing rapidly, replacing traditional face-to-face communications. However, literature provides contradicting results regarding the effectiveness of computer-mediated communication (CMC) versus face-to-face communication. This study attempts to reconcile differences in the literature on the benefits of CMC technologies and co-location. Focusing on knowledge dissemination in technology development processes in high-technology firms, the study investigates the relative impact of CMC technologies and co-location of research and development (R&D) staff, as well as the mutual interaction between them. The present article hypothesizes that CMC technologies and co-location of R&D staff have a positive impact on knowledge dissemination. Further, it is hypothesized that it is more favorable to co-locate R&D staff than to invest in CMC technologies and that the effects of co-location and CMC interact negatively. These hypotheses are tested using empirical data collected from 277 high-technology firms in the United States, and the results are generalized by conducting the same test on data from 125 high-technology firms in the Netherlands. Tests are conducted in a real-world setting, differing from previous comparative studies that mainly used laboratory experiments. Empirical results support the main effects of CMC technologies and co-location of R&D staff on knowledge dissemination. Other empirical results contradict conventional wisdom. Investing in CMC technologies is found to be favorable over co-locating R&D staff for knowledge dissemination. Moreover, the two communication channels strengthen each other. The discussion section presents the contours of a firm-level theory on communication infrastructures and knowledge dissemination, focusing on the scope and the heterogeneity of knowledge dissemination, which may explain these initially surprising results. From the arguments it follows that the choice for investment in eo-location or CMC technologies depends on the scope of knowledge dissemination that has to be facilitated. Furthermore, the conclusion is made that effective knowledge dissemination requires a balanced investment in co-location and information technologies to be able to deal with the heterogeneous but interdependent types of knowledge dissemination.",2007"Toivonen, Riitta; Kumpula, Jussi A.; Saramaki, Jari; Onnela, Jukka-Pekka; Kertesz, Jinos",The role of edge weights in social networks: modelling structure and dynamics,NOISE AND STOCHASTICS IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS AND FINANCE,"The structure of social networks can influence various dynamic processes of human interaction and communication, such as opinion formation and spreading of information or infectious diseases. To facilitate simulation studies of such processes, we have developed a weighted network model to mimic the structure of real social networks, in particular taking into account the recent observations on weight-topology correlations.' The model iterates on a fixed size network, reaching a steady state through processes of weighted local searches, global random attachment, and random deletion of nodes, and it has essentially two parameters which can be used to tune network properties. The generated networks display community structure, with strong internal links and weak links connecting the communities. 2 Similarly to empirical observations, strong ties correlate with overlapping neighborhoods, and under edge removal, the network becomes fragmented faster when weak ties are removed first.(1) As an example of the effects that such structural properties have on dynamic processes, we present preliminary results from studies of social dynamics describing the competition of two non-excluding opinions in a society.

This approach assumes that knowing is trans-historical and universal, and strives to arrive at unassailable justifications for truth claims by defining the necessary and sufficient conditions for which a proposition is known to be true. Imagining an idealised knower, without emotions or history, the goal is absolute abstraction and universal solutions. Traditional epistemologists operate under the assumption that certainty is only achieved by stripping away all but the bare reasoning required to make inferences; thus rendering the social, historical and economic context of the knower irrelevant. The perspective of this idealised knower is a 'view from nowhere' (Nagel, 1986). In this paper we analyse and critique this view in the light of its applicability to the situation and needs of urban dwellers. The findings of our analysis allow us to call for a broadening of knowledge discourse beyond science and technology. We argue for the development of an epistemological model which takes into account and values transitory, informal, soft, implicit, contextual and tacit forms of knowledge, and its sources and utility outside the hard sciences. This model requires policy changes towards a democratisation of knowledge production and exchange and an acknowledgement of the significance of supporting education and urban community networking as mechanisms which enable knowledge sharing and participation in knowledge societies. Our proposed epistemological model supports a 'view from everywhere'. We hope it can uncover policy as well as technical opportunities and help inform ways and approaches to enable the social and community appropriation of information and communication technology for local knowledge production and exchange.",2007"Habib, Johanna; Caraguel, Valerie; Baets, Walter",The use of new technology in higher education: From unlearning to wiki use appropriation in a French business school: A case study,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, VOL 1 AND 2","It is widely agreed that the development of new technology in higher education is of particular importance. Yet, with a few exceptions, little is known about the conditions of appropriation by learners in this specific context. This paper attempts to address the relationship between the appropriation of new technology and the process of unlearning. We investigate why and how the actions modifying old knowledge can favour the use of collaborative and virtual technology. The framework of the paper is built on a review of Giddens's theory of structuration and learning theories, with particular focus on the concept of unlearning (Nystrom and Starbuck 1984). Unlearning is defined as the questioning and destruction process of knowledge, logic and patterns established, in order to propose new responses and behaviours. The empirical study proposes the analysis of the process appropriation of wiki technology by 300 students in a French business school [""Euromed Marseille""] in their workgroup sessions. We use a case study methodology (Eisenhardt 1989, Yin 1990) based on a qualitative investigation (Miles and Huberman 1984) and a combination of different collection. The results show that unlearning of traditional workgroup methods clearly facilitates appropriation of wiki technology. In other words, the unlearning-learning process appears to be essential to create virtual collective knowledge. Furthermore, this research provides some evidence about the factors that influence the speed of unlearning - deviant behaviours and tensions within groups, weak ties among group members, various expertise and visions, flexible collaboration... Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice, and also make recommendations to encourage unlearning opportunities in the process of new technology appropriation.",2007"de Lima, Jorge Avila","Teachers' Professional Development in Departmentalised, Loosely Coupled Organisations: Lessons for school improvement from a case study of two curriculum departments",SCHOOL EFFECTIVENESS AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT,"This paper describes a case study of 2 departments in a school, where teachers were inquired about their school's needs for improvement and how the institution and their department impacted upon their own professional development.

Mediators, individually and collectively, build networks of customers between whom linking can take place, and they provide services that facilitate inter-customer exchanges. Earlier research has shown the importance of size and standardisation in mediation. A different stream of research has shown that contextual knowledge is important for problem solving and innovation in organisations. Combining theories of mediating technology and situated problem solving, the paper posits that inter-customer relations constitute the fundamental context for value creation of firms using the mediating technology. LISREL is used to test relationship-level, cross-sectional hypotheses that link knowledge of inter-customer relationships, added value, and customer commitment to bank services for small firms. This work extends Thompson's work on mediating technology with implications for organisation action by demonstrating that mediators' knowledge of inter- customer relationships is an important resource in intermediation. Three contributions are made to strategic management and organisation theory. First, the paper provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between knowledge and committed customers. Second, fundamental resources are developed for firms using mediating technology.

This paper examines boundary formation in business startups using a nationally representative dataset of U.S. nascent entrepreneurs. We propose several distinct roles for individuals entering into entrepreneurial activity, distinguishing between ""insiders"" (owner-managers) who commit both time and financial resources to these startups and ""outsiders"" (including passive investors and advisors) who offer more limited resource commitments. Two important criteria demarcating organizational insiders and outsiders in emergent organizations are functionality and perceived trustworthiness. Our results suggest that boundary formation is more often based on a potential member's trustworthiness, as perceived by peers, than functionality, emphasizing considerations such as transaction cost minimization and uniqueness of resource contributions. We propose several mechanisms that may account for this result among nascent entrepreneurs, including a lack of economic sophistication, calculative trust, and the importance of social solidarity for founder recruitment.",2007"Evans, James A.","START-UPS IN SCIENCE: ENTREPRENEURS, DIVERSE BACKING, AND NOVELTY OUTSIDE BUSINESS",SOCIOLOGY OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP,"Sociological studies of entrepreneurship focus on social and technical innovations in business.

We mapped the social network used for communication of knowledge and information related to natural resource extraction among villagers in a coastal seascape in Kenya. We further identified subgroups and examined their interrelations while measuring to what extent personal attributes such as occupation can explain observed group structure. Finally, we compared the local ecological knowledge held by villagers of different occupations with the structure of the communication network to map how well this structure can explain distribution of ecological knowledge among them. Results show that communication occurs primarily between fishermen who use the same gear type, which may inhibit exchange of ecological knowledge within the community. This may partly explain why the community has been unsuccessful in regulating resource extraction, especially since potentially influential groups of nonfishermen have a limited communication with the various fisher groups. Analysis of network structure also shows that groups most central, and hence potentially most influential, are dominated in numbers by migrant deep sea fishermen, hypothetically less motivated to initiate collective action for resource management. Hence, we conclude that a lack of collective action to remedy an unsustainable situation may be attributed to various different but distinct aspects of the specific structure of the social network.",2006"Mooradian, Todd; Renzl, Birgit; Matzler, Kurt","Who trusts?

The author builds on Bourdieu ([1986] 2001) classic statement on the 'forms of capital"" (economic, social, and cultural) and the conversion dynamics among them, and on DiMaggio (1987) connection between cultural tastes and sociability. He hypothesizes that (1) in addition to cultural tastes being determined by network relations, cultural tastes are used to form and sustain those networks. Furthermore he expects that (2) highbrow culture taste will be less likely to be converted into social capital beyond immediate strong-tie circles due to its more restricted, ""asset-specific"" nature. Because of its generalized appeal, taste for popular culture will be more likely to be associated with weak-tie network density. The results broadly support these hypotheses: a model that specifies an effect of culture on network density provides a better fit to the data than the traditional conception of networks as determining taste. In addition using log-linear models and instrumental-variable methods, I show that popular culture consumption has a positive impact on weak-tie network density but not strong-tie network density, while highbrow culture consumption selectively increases strong-tie density but has no appreciable effect on weak ties, net of standard socioeconomic variables. These findings help to shed light on the mechanisms that translate mastery of different types of cultural knowledge into integration across distant social positions or closure around strong group boundaries.

Specifically, as trustors learn about others, they base their trust on different kinds of information (demographic similarity, trustworthy behavior, and shared perspective). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses of a field survey of supervisors and subordinates from 3 companies (N = 88) provide evidence consistent with this prediction: Perceived trustworthiness is associated with demographic similarity in newer relationships, with trustworthy behavior in relationships that are neither brand new nor old but in-between, and with shared perspective in older relationships.",2006"Brandt, Martina",Finding a job via social contacts,KOLNER ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE UND SOZIALPSYCHOLOGIE,"When the usefulness of social ties for the improvement of an individual's labour market position is analysed, the unemployed are hardly ever considered.

Our aim in this paper, therefore, is, first, to highlight some of the unresolved issues that surround these concepts, and, second, to explore their usefulness for understanding the evolution of the economic landscape and the process of regional development. We argue that in many important aspects, path dependence and 'lock-in' are place-dependent processes, and as such require geographical explanation. However, the precise meaning of regional 'lock-in', we contend, is unclear, and little is known about why it is that some regional economies become locked into development paths that lose dynamism, whilst other regional economies seem able to avoid this danger and in effect are able to 'reinvent' themselves through successive new paths or phases of development. The issue of regional path creation is thus equally important, but has been rarely discussed. We conclude that whilst path dependence is an important feature of the economic landscape, the concept requires further elaboration if it is to function as a core notion in an evolutionary economic geography.",2006"King, Valarie; Sobolewski, Juliana M.",Nonresident fathers' contributions to adolescent well-being,JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY,"Using data from 453 adolescents in Wave 2 of the National Survey of Families and Households, we examine how multiple dimensions of nonresident father-involvement are associated with different dimensions of child well-being.

The quality of the motherchild relationship, however, has stronger effects on child well-being. Nevertheless, even if adolescents have weak ties to mothers, those who have strong ties to nonresident fathers exhibit fewer internalizing problems and less acting out at school than adolescents who have weak ties to both parents.

Japanese and Korean SMEs manufacturing abroad retain a static comparative advantage in sub-contracting for larger home country firms where accumulated knowledge is sufficient today for cost efficient production. They remain tied largely to knowledge hierarchies at home dominated by larger firms. Weak ties to the local business context abroad, however, deprive them of new learning advantages critical for flexible specialization.

The theoretical part of the article identifies the most useful dimensions of the social-capital concept for this topic, lists hypotheses and suggests three relevant social mechanisms. Empirical studies show how social capital related to participation in voluntary sport organizations is distributed and the consequences this has for various forms of social capital: generalized trust and political commitments.

The principle of reciprocity in exchange theory has been used as an explanation for this. According to the theory, a job seeker who has more resources is more appealing to a matchmaker, who is then more likely to refer the job seeker to a more rewarding job. A strong tie acts to enhance the expectation of reciprocity from the referred person. This study of Chinese working people in Shanghai seeks to identify the effect of strong ties on job referral.

Finally, we investigated two significantly different cases. Case one, the customer did not change his preference, and the Wilcoxon test was used to evaluate the difference between IGA and BiGIGA. The results indicated that our model could correctly and directly capture the customer wanted. Case two, after the Wilcoxon test, it evidenced the lateral transmitting using triad closure extent the conceptual network, which could increase the weight of weak relation and retrieved a good product for the customer.

Findings - The causes and effects of lurking and posting differed. Lurking contributed to brand loyalty more than posting did, and the primary purpose of lurking was to look for information regarding product function/performance, instead of satisfying consumers' affective needs. Research limitations/implications - As a result of the limitations in a computer mediated communication environment, virtual consumer communities should be perceived as an arena for weak-tied strangers to communicate for word-of-mouth (Won behavior, rather than as a brand community.

We introduce a new triad census method to examine personal networks of strong and weak ties. For 125 egocentric networks we correlated the triad census results with several extensively researched psychological instruments. The triad census reduced to three principal components, describing central aspects of strength-of-weak-ties and structural holes theories. Psychological predispositions explained a significant proportion of the variance in each of these components. Our results suggest that people who see themselves vulnerable to external forces tend to inhabit closed networks of weak connections. On the other hand, people who seek to keep their strong tie partners apart, and thereby bridge structural holes, tend to be individualists, to believe that they control the events in their lives, and to have higher levels of neuroticism. Finally, people with strong network closure and ""weak"" structural holes (as with the ""strength of weak ties"") tend to categorize themselves and others in terms of group memberships.

I used data collected from a wild population of cooperative mongoose (the meerkat, Suricata suricatta) to test four predictions arising from the hypothesis: first, that an individual's frequency of play, and mean number of play partners, will be positively correlated with group size (because individuals in large groups must strengthen ties with a greater number of animals); second, an individual's frequency of play will be positively related to frequency of other affiliative interactions such as allogrooming; third, an individual's frequency of play will be positively correlated with level of contribution to cooperative group activities (based on the assumption that individuals that are closely bonded to their group will invest more heavily in the group than those with weak ties); and finally, an individual's frequency of play will be positively correlated with duration of tenancy in the natal group. The behaviour of young meerkats failed to fulfil any of these predictions, and I conclude that social play is unlikely to have the capacity to promote social cohesion in mammals.

Until now, SWT has never been directly tested but treated instead as a surrogate for the relationship between an actor's network and labor market outcomes such as characteristics of a job obtained. The paper restates SWT as a proposition about the probability of getting a job as a function of within-actor differences in tie strength and tests it with data on hires carried out in one Russian city in 1998. In support of SWT the results show that a worker is more likely to get a job through one of her weak ties rather than strong ties. The advantages of weak ties lie in their abilities to provide timely access to non-redundant information and to influence employers directly. In contrast, strong ties are associated with indirect influence on employers through well-connected intermediaries.

This paper argues that insights from the literature on social networks and information dissemination can help provide courts with a coherent and consistent methodology for determining whether an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy in a particular fact that he has shared with one or more persons. The social networks literature has generated theoretical and empirical insights about the probability that information disclosed to one member of a community will ultimately become known by a large segment of the community. Using these insights, courts can gauge whether the plaintiffs previously private information would have been widely disseminated regardless of the defendant's actions in a particular case. If so, the information in question was public, and if not, the tort law ought to deem the information private.

As expected, intraregional and intrafirm knowledge flows are found to be stronger than those across regional or firm boundaries. I explore whether these patterns can be explained by direct and indirect network ties among inventors, as inferred from past collaborations among them. The existence of a tie is found to be associated with a greater probability of knowledge flow, with the probability decreasing as the path length (geodesic) increases. Furthermore, the effect of regional or firm boundaries on knowledge flow decreases once interpersonal ties have been accounted for. In fact, being in the same region or firm is found to have little additional effect on the probability of knowledge flow among inventors who already have close network ties.

Communities with ""bridging"" social capital (weak ties across groups) as well as ""bonding"" social capital (strong ties within groups) are the most effective in organizing for collective action.

When people with bridging ties use communication media, such as the Internet, they enhance their capability to educate community members and to organize, as needed, for collective action. This article summarizes evidence from stratified household survey data in Blacksburg, VA, showing that people with weak (bridging) ties across groups have higher levels of community involvement, civic interest, and collective efficacy than people without bridging ties among groups. Moreover, heavy Internet users with bridging ties have higher social engagement, use the Internet for social purposes, and have been attending more local meetings and events since going online than heavy Internet users with no bridging ties.

Therefore, although the use of social networks in job search may enhance women's actual knowledge of prevailing wages, I hypothesize that institutional characteristics that employers could assume to constrain women's networks and concomitant access to salary information will directly affect salary offers, as well as moderating the influence of network ties on pay. To test this perspective. job search outcomes of women attending elite coeducational and women's colleges were examined. Regarding the number of offers obtained, women who consulted with proportionally more male peer and employed adult male advice ties received significantly more job offers than women using fewer male advice contacts. With regard to salary offers, this study reveals an institutional sex composition effect: women exiting single-sex institutions (i.e., women's colleges) received significantly lower salary offers than women from coeducational schools, even after accounting for human capital, job characteristics, and institutional reputation. The effects of social networks on pay were moderated by institutional sex composition such that women exiting women's colleges received lower returns in the form of salary to their cross-gender advice ties than did women from a matched coeducational institution.

Contemporary KM initiatives increasingly include expertise-sharing networks that help answer questions about who knows what. These systems allow organizations to locate and leverage the specialized engineering and technical expertise that is held in the minds of dispersed individuals. However, stories of such expertise-sharing networks that languish from under-use and abandonment abound and the issue of continuance has received very little attention in prior research. In this paper, we explore this understudied issue. We develop a model of expertise-sharing network system continuance through a four-year observational study of 418 users of two such systems and then empirically test it using multiperiod data collected from 122 users of four such systems. The concept of irretrievable investments was used to guide theoretical development in the initial observational phase of the study. The study makes several unique theoretical contributions. First, it develops a model that illustrates how irretrievable postadoption investments (sunk costs) by individual users of expertise-network systems increase continuance. We empirically show that the model explains approximately half of the total variance in continuance intention. This model advances continuance beyond the traditional expectation-satisfaction model of initial adoption to more advanced postadoption stages of use and theoretically incorporates the network-specificity aspect of postadoption investments in explaining continuance. Specifically, we show that individual users': 1) reputation among peer users of a system increases continuance; 2) system-mediated relationships with other users of the system increase continuance; and 3) investments in personalization of a system initially diminish continuance.

The transformation from nonmarket towards market society provides a unique chance to test social theories. The aim of this article is to scrutinize Marc Granovetters statement of the qualitative similarity of networks in market and non-market societies. Being analyzed in terms of economical embeddedness in social relations, networks are assumed to differ only gradually. In opposition to Granovetters considerations Ilja Srubar argues for qualitative differences between networks in the former GDR and Germany since networks in the GDR arose on the ground of scarcity of goods, leading to social relations which can be described in terms of reciprocity. In order to operationalize the qualitative shifts of networks since 1989, two types of networks are distinguished: weak-ties and strong-ties.

It goes without saying that knowledge can be the source of competitive advantages because of its unique and sticky characteristics (Conner & Prahalad, 1996; Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997). However, that advantage can be limited to a certain business unit, department or project-team (Argote & Ingram, 2000; Gupta & Govindarajan, 2000; Szulanski, 1996). To build organization-wide capabilities and competences, knowledge needs to be transferred within the organisation but this is a highly complex process (Argote & Ingram, 2000; Szulanski, 2000). We draw on a review of the existing literature to analyse how knowledge can cross unit boundaries within larger organisations. This is to develop an analytical model of the effects of different inter-unit linkages on the sharing of knowledge. We describe the linkages between units and members of the units in terms of coordination mechanisms. Our study highlights the characteristics of each of these linkages in terms of intensity and complexity of knowledge and intensity in knowledge sharing. In addition, the role of trust is discussed. We observe that different types are associated with distinctive constraints for particular kinds of knowledge needs; for example, informal networks are able to deal with the need for sharing complex knowledge but do not allow enough flexibility in the knowledge-sharing possibilities. A case study in a British multinational company in the production and retail sector seeks fir empirical evidence of our assumed relationships between linkages and knowledge-sharing possibilities. The case reveals the role of informal networks, the impact of the complexity of knowledge and shared mindset. Strategic directions turned out to have a major effect on the possibilities to share knowledge.

We investigate these questions through a broad empirical analysis of factors affecting the short-term persistence of local chapters of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). Reasoning that multiple forms of social capital would each have a positive impact on survival, we assess the independent effect of several indicators of social capital with mixed results. Consistent with prior research, we find that access to patronage at founding and a greater stock of weak ties in the community confer survival advantages. Yet SMOs that emerged from preexisting groups and those with leaders previously tied to one another through civic engagement were less likely to persist, raising a first cautionary flag about the generality of advantages of resource co-optation and ""bloc recruitment.""

Theoretical approaches in the work of Putnam, Jacobs, and Coleman are compared and qualitative neighbourhood case studies used to identify contextual influences on social capital's sources and forms, and on the strong or weak ties involved. The neighbourhood's potential as a source of more inclusive and integrative social networks and wider solidarity is addressed. Influences on key sources of social capital - stability, integration, solidarity and tolerance - embrace issues of both structure and agency; relationships can be recursive. Neighbourhood variations in reciprocity and participation underline social capital's context specificity. Narratives suggest that the neighbourhood's potential for sustaining inclusive social ties, for social integration, tolerance, solidarity and 'thin' (as well as 'thick') trust is contingent on certain resources and conditions. They indicate also how local work history is reflected in the organic nature of social capital.

Using social network theory, the authors investigate buyers' preferences for specific patterns of relationships among buyers, intermediary vendors, and suppliers of complex products. Using a conjoint experiment with actual and prospective buyers of integrated computer networks and services, the authors find that beyond their dyadic interaction with a vendor, buyers take into account the buyer-vendor-supplier triad. Specifically, buyers value sequences of selective strong ties as well as sequences of more numerous weak ties. This is consistent with theoretical propositions that strong ties facilitate the mobilization of support and the transfer of complex knowledge, whereas nonoverlapping weak ties facilitate the gathering of intelligence and the monitoring of new developments. The authors find only mixed evidence that buyers value direct access to suppliers when strong ties exist between the vendor and suppliers, as predicted by the third-party sanctioning argument in social network theory. In addition, they find that interaction intensity and valence do not always have the same effects, thus providing criterion validation to the bidimensional nature of tie strength that has been documented in previous research.",2004"Levin, DZ; Cross, R",The strength of weak ties you can trust: The mediating role of trust in effective knowledge transfer,MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"Research has demonstrated that relationships are critical to knowledge creation and transfer, yet findings have been mixed regarding the importance of relational and structural characteristics of social capital for the receipt of tacit and explicit knowledge.

Sociological theories of deviant behavior have not been systematically applied to the problem of who uses and who does not use cyberpornography on the Internet. The present study contributes to the literature by providing the first systematic application of selected sociological theories of deviance to the problem of explaining use of cyberpornography. It tests a blended theoretical perspective, which includes measures from social control and opportunity theories of deviance, as well as measures of broader deviant lifestyles, as possible predictors of use of cyberporn. A key hypothesis is that persons with the strongest ties to conventional society will be less likely than others to use cyberporn. Methods. Complete data on 531 Internet users are taken from the General Social Surveys for 2000. Social bonds measures include religious, marital, and political ties. Measures of participation in sexual and drug-related deviant lifestyles, and demographic controls are included. Results. The results of a logistic regression analysis found that among the strongest predictors of use of cyberporn were weak ties to religion and lack of a happy marriage. However, past sexual deviance (e.g., involvement in paid sex) was also a strong predictor of cyberporn use. Overall the model explained 40 percent of the variance in porn use on the Internet.

Yet, strong tie relationships with White and male layoff survivors in key strategic positions can help African-American and women survivors maintain their existing job position because they can then borrow the social capital resources of the White and male survivors.

Our simulation model suggests that when few need information, groups will pursue an acquaintance strategy by investing time and resources in gaining `weak tie' political acquaintances rather than in gaining `strong tie' political friends, but that as the collective demand for information rises, groups increasingly follow a chum strategy, placing greater emphasis on establishing strong ties. We test these hypotheses in an analysis of inter-organizational contact-making in U.S. health politics, using the data of Laumann and Knoke (1987), with OLS regressions of average group contacts over lobbying events over time and maximum likelihood count models of contacts across interest groups. Both analyses show that as collective demand for information increases, interest groups place greater priority on establishing strong ties, even while controlling for organizational attributes such as budget, mobilization capacity and organization age.

Yet remarkably little systematic research has been conducted on the political economy of commercial reform in the post-Communist world. We argue that the fragmentation of power within post-Communist countries has been a potent force for trade liberalization. In non-democracies where political power is highly concentrated in the hands of a small group of elites, state leaders face few impediments to rent seeking and are well insulated from interests favouring commercial reform. In non-democracies where power is fragmented within the national government, however, new elites with weak ties to the old regime are well placed to use trade liberalization as a weapon against their political opponents. Moreover, the dispersion of power in non-democracies creates space for groups favouring free trade to promote trade liberalization. Finally, in democracies, the dispersion of power within the national government combined with electoral competition creates an especially potent impetus to trade liberalization. To assess these arguments, we analyse the trade policy of post-Communist countries during the period 1990-98.

Military service and professional success in civilian life in Switzerland,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE,"In Switzerland it has often been argued, at least until recently, that a career in the armed forces is greatly beneficial to professional success in civilian life. Despite the fact that, as a peculiarity of the Swiss militia system, professional and military careers are interwoven in the biographical process, the actual influence of a military career on professional success has yet to be empirically verified. Moreover, it is also necessary to ask what the possible reasons for this might be. Consequently, the first goal of this paper is to examine empirically whether a military career has a positive effect on a civilian career. Second, possible explanations will be discussed. In particular, self selection, the acquisition of human capital (leadership qualities), and the establishment of an effective social network will be considered. The analyses which are based on the Swiss Labor Market Survey 1998 show, first of all, that higher military ranks go hand in hand with higher monetary income even when controlling for education and work experience. Second, the income premium does not seem to be based on mechanisms of self-selection nor on the acquisition of particularly profitable human capital. Rather it is to be assumed that the greater professional success of Swiss militia officers is due to their rich social network of ""valuable"" ties.",2003"Teigland, R; Wasko, MM",Integrating knowledge through information trading: Examining the relationship between boundary spanning communication and individual performance,DECISION SCIENCES,"With the global penetration of Internet technologies, individuals may now cross organizational boundaries to communicate efficiently with others regardless of time and space. Thus, when looking for help in solving work tasks, knowledge workers may just as easily contact individuals in rival firms across the globe as a coworker sitting at the next desk. As a result, management faces questions such as (1) How should firms manage employees' knowledge-sourcing activities when they span both intra-organizational and extra-organizational boundaries, and (2) What is the relationship between different knowledge-sourcing activities and individual performance? Grounded in the knowledge-based view of the firm, we investigate these questions using data from Europe's largest information technology (IT) services and management consulting company. Our results provide evidence that organizations should support boundary spanning and knowledge sourcing from both internal and external sources. Results suggest (1) a positive relationship between boundary spanning communication and creativity and general performance, and (2) a negative relationship between a reliance on colocated coworkers as knowledge sources and creativity.",2003"Wasonga, T; Christman, DE",Perceptions and construction of meaning of urban high school experiences among African American university students - A focus group approach,EDUCATION AND URBAN SOCIETY,"The perceptions of African American university students and how them construct meaning from high school experiences A ere examined.

This is due to the greater ability of such communities to organize and mobilize effectively for collective action because they have high levels of social trust, social networks, and well-established norms of mutuality (the major features of social capital). Communities with 'bridging' social capital (weak ties across groups) as well as 'bonding' social capital (strong ties within groups) are the most effective in organizing for collective action (Granovetter, 1973; Putnam, 2000). People who belong to multiple groups act as bridging ties Simmel [1908] 1950; Wellman, 1988). When people with bridging ties use communication media, such as the Internet, they enhance their capability to educate community members, and organize, as needed, for collective action. This paper summarizes evidence from stratified household survey data in Blacksburg, Virginia showing that people with weak (bridging) ties across groups have higher levels of community involvement, civic interest and collective efficacy than people without bridging ties to groups. Moreover, heavy Internet users with bridging ties have higher social engagement, use the Internet for social purposes, and have been attending more local meetings and events since going online than heavy Internet users with no bridging ties. These findings may suggest that the Internet - in the hands of bridging individuals -- is a tool for maintaining social relations, information exchange, and increasing face-to-face interaction, all of which help to build both bonding and bridging social capital in communities.",2003"Dewett, T",Understanding the relationship between information technology and creativity in organizations,CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL,"Creativity is vital to organizational success.

This article will begin to fill this gap by exploring the ways that IT might influence creativity in organizations. This is important for organizational studies, given that knowledge and information are among the most important ingredients for creativity and are the very things that IT exist to manage. In this article, the creativity literature and much of the management oriented IT literature will be explored to suggest that IT plays an integral role in the creative process within organizations. Specifically, the main benefits that IT affords organizations will be considered and then applied to the requirements for creative production, the stages of the individual creative process, the process of organizational learning as related to creativity, and the creative process within large-scale project-based work.

We study egocentric networks of high-growth entrepreneurial firms in the IT industry and explore how these firms grow through the Use of external relations and become competitive. Based on case study research, we identify that Firms are using relations for a variety of purposes and that every firm has an individual relational mix. This relational mix changes with the development of the firms. While the relative importance of social and reputational networks decrease with the firms' development, co-opetition networks increase over time. Knowledge and innovation networks are a function of reputation and management capacity while the development of marketing networks depends on the firm's culture and management style. Both weak ties and strong tics are important for the growth of the firm since they fulfil different functions. Firm growth is determined by path-dependent relational capability that eventually reaches its limits and leads to the reconfiguration of a rather stable network. Additionally, firm growth depends not only on the building of egocentric networks but also on the existence and development of healthy sociocentric networks.",2003"Larsen, G",Informal communication networks and the diffusion of innovations in UK construction projects: A research design,"INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONTRUCTION","The UK industry has been criticised for being slow to adopt construction process innovations. Research shows that the idiosyncrasies of participants, their roles in the system and the contextual differences between sections of the industry make this a highly complex problem. There is considerable evidence that informal social networks play a key role in diffusion of innovations. The aim is to identify informal communication networks of project participants and the role these play in the diffusion of construction innovations. The characteristics of this network will be analysed in order to understand how they can be used to accelerate innovation diffusion within and between projects. Social Network Analysis is used to determine informal communication routes. Control and experiment case study projects are used within two different organizations. This allows informal communication routes concerning innovations to be mapped, whilst testing if the informal routes can facilitate diffusion. Analysis will focus upon understanding the combination of informal strong and weak ties, and how these impede or facilitate the diffusion of the innovation. Initial work suggests the presence of an informal communication network. Actors within this informal network, and the organization's management are unaware of its' existence and their informal roles within it. Thus, the network remains an untapped medium regarding innovation diffusion. It is proposed that successful innovation diffusion is dependent upon understanding informal strong and weak ties, at project, organization and industry level.",2003"Hong, JC",Internet use and cross-cultural adaptation: A social network perspective,"INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON POLITICS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS","This article investigates the role of Internet in the cross-cultural adaptation of the Mainland college students studying in Hong Kong from the perspective of social network theory.

This paper develops a third view, a relational perspective, which describes how social relationships between knowledge messengers and knowledge receivers affect the way that managers evaluate new knowledge. We begin by focusing on two key dimensions of relational perception: social identification and threat appraisals. We then use these dimensions to derive a typology of six ""relational schemas"" that are commonly perceived between knowledge messengers and knowledge receivers at work. Next, we reveal how, holding knowledge content constant, these relational schemas bias the ways in which managers evaluate new knowledge. While network research demonstrates that relationships determine which knowledge managers see, this paper demonstrates that these relationships also have psychological implications by affecting how managers evaluate the knowledge that they see.",2003"Teorell, J",Linking social capital to political participation: Voluntary associations and networks of recruitment in Sweden,SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES,"That organizational involvement has a positive impact on political action is a well-established finding in empirical research around the world. To account for this, theorists since Tocqueville have pointed to the returns in human capital, in particular 'civic skills', yielded by associations. This article, by contrast, is a study of whether social capital theory can help explain the same effect. According to the logic of 'weak ties', organizational involvement provides bridging social capital by connecting the individual to a wider range of people. As a result, the input of requests for participation increases and this ultimately leads to more activity. Unspecified in this argument, however, is what aspect of associational memberships is most conducive to such weak ties: the sheer number of memberships, or the extent to which one's memberships provide links to people of dissimilar social origin. In an unprecedented empirical test based on survey data from Sweden in 1997, it is shown that being connected to multiple voluntary associations is what matters for political activity, not the extent to which one's memberships cut across social cleavages. Moreover, the social capital mechanism of recruitment is more important in explaining this effect than the human capital mechanism of civic skills, since the former can account for why even passive members, not just organizational activists, may become more prone to take political action.",2003"Jenssen, JI; Koenig, HF",The effect of social networks on resource access and business start-ups,EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES,"In previous research, entrepreneurs' social networks are expected to influence entrepreneurial success because they give access to resources.

I examine the relationship between religious involvement and status-bridging social capital by analyzing data from a large nationally representative survey of the U.S. adult population that included questions about friendships with elected public officials, corporation executives, scientists, and persons of wealth. The data show that membership in a religious congregation and holding a congregational leadership position are most consistently associated with greater likelihood of having these kinds of friendships.

Whereas qualitative methods render rich description of human interaction, they can be unwieldy for studying complex formal and informal organizations that operate over great distances and through new media.

Goal: This study attempts (1) to determine whether there are any social network effects on STD transmission after controlling for other risk factors and (2) to explore the possible mechanisms by which social networks exert their effects. Study Design: Logistic regressions examine the effects of friendship networks on STD transmission using data drawn from the Chicago Health and Social Life Survey (CHSLS). Additional logistic regressions probe the possible mechanisms (social control versus information and dyadic versus third party) that account for how the observed effects of networks might arise. Results and Conclusion: Among people who had fewer than 13 lifetime sex partners, those with no social friends were only 0.4 times as likely to be infected as those with one or more social friends. Among people who had 13 or more lifetime partners, those with many friends (5 or 6) but weak ties to them (talking less than once a day with them) were only 0.2 times as likely to be infected as those with either fewer friends or stronger ties to their friends. Additional regressions suggest that network effects resting on dyadic control prevail among those with fewer than 13 lifetime sex partners.

It is argued from the research literature and studies by the author that where ties are strong, communicators can influence each other to adapt and expand their use of media to support the exchanges important to their tie, but where ties are weak, communicators are dependent on common, organizationally established means of communication and protocols established by others. Due to this differential use of media, a new medium that adds means and opportunities for previously unconnected others to communicate will have positive effects on weak ties and weak-tie networks, in particular by laying an infrastructure of latent ties (ones that exist technically but have not yet been activated), and providing an opportunity for weak ties to develop and strengthen. A new medium may also have positive effects on strongly tied pairs where it adds another means of communicating and supports the communication needs and tasks of the pair. However, where a new medium replaces a former, common means of communication, the dependence of weak ties on a common medium makes weak-tie networks highly susceptible to dissolution. In contrast, strong-tie networks, with their connections via multiple relations and multiple media, can be expected to be more robust under conditions of change.",2002"Beaulieu, L; Cichocki, W",The concept of a social network in a rural Acadian community,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE LINGUISTIQUE,"This article reexamines the concept of social network used in variationist sociolinguistics by analyzing network structure in terms of different domains of affiliation that are associated with strong ties and with weak ties found inside and outside a speech community.

Variable rule analyses show that social network is a more regular predictor of the traditional variants comme que, quand que, and si que than other social factors, including social class.

The social networks generated by the target diagram which operationalizes the convoy model display the structural and functional characteristics set out in its theoretical arguments. But not all of the ties constituting these networks are conduits of social support and, more importantly, these social networks do not include all supporting and supported others. The target diagram identifies core support networks; therefore, support flowing through weak ties is missed when it is used to set the boundaries of support networks.

Cognitive learning depends on the organizational members who participate in the learning process. The concept of the socio-cognitive conflict is suggested as a form of organizational learning in which the relationships between the participating members cause and determine (the result of) the learning process. Starting with this notion of the socio-cognitive conflict as a vehicle for learning, it is reasoned that the organization has to provide the underlying social networks to foster learning. Social networks should be actively installed. The question of which social network is appropriate for learning depends on the problem situation. Drawing heavily on insights from social networks, different types of networks are identified which foster learning in specific problem situations.",2002"Chua, WF; Poullaos, C","The Empire Strikes Back?

It could not be ruled uniformly or in detail and different governance structures emerged. In the settler colonies, relatively autonomous 'self-government' embodying variants of British precedents and institutions, provided a loose coupling of centre and periphery. The accounting associations that developed in this type of colony were, then, not compliant clones of the centre but hybrids reflecting the specificity of place and British accommodation of peripheral demands. The result was the emergence of an imperial accountancy arena. These empirics contribute to our understanding of the nineteenth century professionalisation of accounting as a cross-border phenomenon by showing how the strength of weak ties between parts of a periphery characterised by inter-colony differences (as well as similarities) imposed constraints on the imperial centre.

Using telephone survey data collected after the outbreak of an extensive commercial rumor in Hong Kong, the present paper investigates the characteristics of social ties through which the information is spread and the tie effect on information dissemination. Results show that while mass media, particularly television, serves as a major channel of information flow, social ties are also widely used.

However, we know little about how organizational relationships established by a relative position in a formal structure or social relationships established by interpersonal processes influence whom is sought out for various kinds of information. Prior research suggests that people often receive some combination of five benefits when seeking information from other people: 1) solutions; 2) meta-knowledge (pointers to databases or people); 3) problem reformulation; 4) validation of plans or solutions; and 5) legitimation from contact with a respected person. This research builds on that work by assessing the influence of organizational and social structures (such as similarity of job function, hierarchy, task interdependence, physical proximity, influence, trust, friendship, and gender) on receipt of these benefits from other people in a physically distributed organization. Task interdependence is the strongest and most consistent predictor of information seeking.

In this paper it is argued that people invest in relationships with certain others partly in order to solve these problems. Hence, the personal networks that result provide solutions to system-induced problems and they reflect the institutional environment. Personal networks of people living in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) during communism are examined, and social capital theory is used to explain why communism did not produce social integration. In a communist society like that of the former GDR, weak ties are a liability, not an asset. Therefore, GDR citizens trusted only people whom they knew well, Since people in the former GDR were acutely aware of political control and the damage potential of weak ties, they invested only cautiously in others. They kept their distance from strangers and all others whose trustworthiness was uncertain and discussed politics only with people whom they truly trusted (the 'niche'). Yet the shortages of the command economy forced people to rely on weak informal ties to secure necessary goods and services. Personal networks in East Germany had two specialized parts each kept separate from the other, a division of labor that vanished after the fall of the Wall. Our hypotheses are tested using multilevel models and triad analyses with data collected in 1992 and 1994 from two random samples in Leipzig and Dresden (n = 489). The first measurement focuses on the situation before the upheaval, the other the situation in 1994. Results show that during communism people indeed created 'niches' consisting of dense, small networks of close relations with similar and trustworthy others. Provision networks were maintained that were small, heterogeneous, and consisted of weak and uniplex ties. Furthermore, there was a relational 'gap' between the niche and the provision network. These differences have gradually been vanishing since the fall of the Wall and with the political and economic unification of the former GDR and the former FRG.",2001"Goldenberg, J; Libai, B; Muller, E",Talk of the network: A complex systems look at the underlying process of word-of-mouth,MARKETING LETTERS,"Though word-of-mouth (w-o-m) communications is a pervasive and intriguing phenomenon, little is known on its underlying process of personal communications. Moreover as marketers are getting more interested in harnessing the power of w-o-m, for e-business and other not related activities, the effects of the different communications types on macro level marketing is becoming critical. In particular we are interested in the breakdown of the personal communication between closer and stronger communications that are within an individual's own personal group (strong tics) and weaker and less personal communications that an individual makes with a wide set of other acquaintances and colleagues (weak ties). We use a technique borrowed from Complex Systems Analysis called stochastic cellular automata in order to generate data and analyze the results so that answers to our main research issues could be ascertained. The following summarizes the impact of strong and weak ties on the speed of acceptance of a new product: The influence of weak tics is at least as strong as the influence of strong ties. Despite the relative inferiority of the weak tic parameter in the model's assumptions, their effect approximates or exceeds that of strong ties, in all stages of the product life cycle. External marketing efforts (e.g., advertising) are effective. However, beyond a relatively early stage of the growth cycle of the new product, their efficacy quickly diminishes and strong and weak ties become the main forces propelling growth, The results clearly indicate that information dissemination is dominated by both weak and strong w-o-m, rather than by advertising. The effect of strong ties diminishes as personal network size decreases. Market attributes were also found to mediate the effects of weak and strong ties. When personal networks are small, weak ties were found to have a stronger impact on information dissemination than strong ties.",2001"Haythornthwaite, C",Exploring multiplexity: Social network structures in a computer-supported distance learning class,INFORMATION SOCIETY,"A computer-mediated group is a complex entity whose members exchange many types of information via multiple means of communication in pursuit of goals specific to their environment.

To explore this complex interaction, a case study is presented of the social networks of interactions and media use among members of a class of computer-supported distance learners. Results show how group structures associated with project teams dominated who communicated with whom, about what, and via which media over the term, and how media came to occupy their own communication niches: Webboard for diffuse class-wide communication; Internet Relay Chat more to named others but still for general communication across the class; and e-mail primarily for intrateam communication.

I also examine the differential impact of legislative measures on the availability of strong versus weak ties for four groups of professionals: physicians, nurses, engineers and scientists. Not only do weak ties figure heavily on the immigration experiences of professionals, but those impacts affect women differently than men. Professional women rely more heavily on strong ties than on weak ties when compared with males in their respective professions, with the exception of nursing. These findings suggests a need for further study into the migration experiences of professionals as well as more research into how gendered networks develop among immigrant professionals and how those networks influence (either positively or negatively) immigrant adaptation to United States' society.",2001"Valente, TW; Vlahov, D",Selective risk taking among needle exchange participants: Implications for supplemental interventions,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,"Objectives. This study characterized social network context of HIV risk behavior among injection drug users who participated in a needle exchange program. Methods. Interviews were conducted with 1184 injection drug users at the Baltimore Needle Exchange Program enrolled in an evaluation cohort. Analysis consisted of multiple logistic regression with statistical adjustment for the interdependence of observations. Results. Of the 203 (17.1 %) injection drug users who reported using a syringe after someone else, 78.3% reported sharing with close friends, and the adjusted odds ratio of any sharing and sharing with close friends was 30.9. Injection drug users were more likely to report sharing with a strong-tie close friend (adjusted odds ratio=1.52) and less likely to report sharing with other close friends if those friends were weak ties and new to their network, Friendship ties were not stable, with fewer than 30% of the friends being repeat nominations.

S&T human capital encompasses not only the individual human capital endowments but also researchers' tacit knowledge, craft knowledge, and know-how. S&T human capital further includes the social capital that scientists continually draw upon in creating knowledge - for knowledge creation is neither a solitary nor singular event. In sum, it is this expanded notion of human capital when paired with a productive social capital network that enables researcher's to create and transform knowledge and ideas in ways that would not be possible without these resources.

Impressionistic evidence suggests that conspiracies that carry out violent attacks usually have a small number of participants, and that large conspiracies either fail to materialize, fail to organize actual attacks, or are substantially less difficult to uncover. Due to the prevalence of weak social ties in larger groups there may be an intermediate group size, around 7-10 members, that is highly subject to infiltration. Building on work by Freeman, Granovetter, and others, this study examines a few features of the social ecology of interaction ties. We introduce a procedure for counting, within groups of size n, all interacting pairs {P, Q}, where P and Q are disjoint or nonoverlapping subsets (Freeman, 1992: 153) of a given group; these subsets usually contain more than one person, i.e., the interacting units do not invariably consist of individuals. This procedure generates interaction configurations having unique patterns of strong, weak, and weakest'' ties - i.e., three levels of tie strength corresponding to core, primary, and secondary ties in Freeman's terminology - such that relatively weak ties predominate within larger conspiracies. We speculate about ways in which these configurations may evolve through time. We then use a combinatorial analysis of group structure to develop a rough calculation of the probability of infiltrating conspiracies of size n, and we show that relatively large conspiracies, having 7 or more members, tend to have interaction structures that make them highly vulnerable to infiltration. Finally, Collins' (1985: 170-172) approach to interaction-chain analysis suggests that, while in real situations it would be hard to anticipate departures from our probability model, attempts to ""turn around'' conspirators with weak ties appear to have a fairly high prospect of success.

There are 1131 working women in the MEWS; 73% are white, 20% African American, and 2% other races.

Using strategic alliance networks in the semiconductor and steel industries, we build on past embeddedness research by examining the interaction of these factors. We argue that the roles relational and structural embeddedness play in firm performance can only be understood with reference to the other. Moreover, we argue that the influence of these factors on firm performance is contingent on industry context. More specifically, our empirical analysis suggests that strong ties in a highly interconnected strategic alliance network negatively impact firm performance. This network configuration is especially suboptimal for firms in the semiconductor industry. Furthermore, strong and weak ties are positively related to firm performance in the steel and semiconductor industries, respectively.

Analysis of observation and interview data revealed that nurses were, indeed, bridging weak ties--who played an important role in linking seniors with local services, because they provided HSI in a caring manner that seniors associated with strong ties. Although nurses were not always aware of their HSI-giving role and referral behavior, they used various techniques to identify seniors' needs and often used strategies to persuade clients to use their information. Among other findings were ""missed opportunities"" and affective aspects of information giving. Seniors reported using HSI in ways that differed from what nurses intended, which suggests that information helps in indirect ways. Overall, the clinic setting was identified as a rich information ground that fosters the informal sharing of HSI among all participants through social interaction.

A comprehensive review of the literature shows that forgetting is a pervasive, non-trivial phenomenon in the recall-based elicitation of personal and social networks pertaining to a broad variety of social relations. There appear to be no good predictors of individuals' proportional level of forgetting, although the number of persons an individual recalls is moderately positively correlated with the number of persons he or she forgets. People seem to be more likely to forget weak ties than strong ties, but the evidence is mixed on this point. In any event, people still forget a significant proportion of their close contacts. Non-specific prompting for additional relevant persons, multiple elicitation questions, and re-interviewing enhance recall slightly to moderately and are the only methods currently available to counteract forgetting, albeit only partially.

After demonstrating that high- and low-level members are very similar in personal attributes, it focuses on social ties and organizational affiliations. As expected, the data suggest that an individual's level of involvement is increased by strong ties to other members, structural similarity to other high-level members, and fewer ties to nonmembers. Extramovement organizational affiliations are often assumed to diminish actors' structural availability, though empirical research in differential recruitment has generally revealed a positive effect on participation in social movements. This study addresses a microstructural explanation for the variation between competition and mutualism in a local multiorganizational field, as it shows how organizational goals condition the effect of outside affiliations on level of participation. Paradoxically, ties to other organizations with irrelevant goals appear to facilitate participation in this group, while ties to groups with congruent goals diminish participation.",1999"Kohli, M; Kunemund, H; Motel, A; Szydlik, M","Weak ties, strong ties?

The urban economy is supported by a network of family, alliance, and client relations. The overlap existing between waged and unwaged work can be understood only by looking closely at the network of social ties present outside the production site. Switching from the analysis of urban work relationships in Africa to the analysis of social networks is almost spontaneous, because a system of relational actions and strategies grows around the figure of the worker. The importance of the ""strength of weak ties"" in procuring employment is as a whole confirmed, but African sociability creates an intense inter-network relational interchange.

I use a network study of 120 new-product development projects undertaken by 41 divisions in a large electronics company to examine the task of developing new products in the least amount of time. Findings show that weak interunit ties help a project team search for useful knowledge in other subunits but impede the transfer of complex knowledge, which tends to require a strong tie between the two parties to a transfer. Having weak interunit ties speeds up projects when knowledge is not complex but slows them down when the knowledge to be transferred is highly complex.

It examines the extent to which getting ahead in an industrial communist society depends on social capital, which by existing research was shown to be the case in agrarian communist and capitalist industrial societies. Industrial technology and a Marxist ideology supposedly both impede particularism, suggesting that social capital is not that important for getting ahead. In addition, the relationship between the use of and access to social resources is explored. Retrospective data from two random samples collected in 1992 and 1993 in Leipzig and Dresden have been used to test our expectations. Although universalism seemingly dominated the attainment process, as a person's education was more important than his father's resources, nearly half of the employed got their jobs through some informal channel. Yet, the use of informal resources only led to a better job if the contact person had high occupational prestige. Part of the influence of human capital on occupational achievement should be attributed to the effect of a person's social capital, i.e. a contact person with high prestige. Access to occupations through informal ties did not imply that these ties were used. Although one reached higher occupational ranks through weak ties (acquaintances), access through strong ties (friends or relatives) was crucial for finding a contact person with high prestige. This probably reflects the high damage potential of using illegal particularistic ties under communism. Using a high prestige contact person was far more important for getting a better job than having access to higher occupations.",1999"Doel, C",Towards a supply-chain community? Insights from governance processes in the food industry,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A,"In the context of the proliferation of own-label subcontract relations across the food industry, there has been some speculation about the emergence of trust-based buyer- supplier relations. Instead of an old-established adversarial system, the food industry has allegedly witnessed the development of trust-based partnerships along the supply chain. These have been nurtured by sophisticated retailers apparently in order to secure reliable sources of supply. The author examines the nature, extent, and consequences of this transformation. She argues that, although there is a tendency for buyers to favour 'known' suppliers, the role and importance of 'weak ties' is subsumed beneath straightforward competitive processes. To the extent that a community of supply-chain partners has been created, its role in terms of filiere dynamics is simply one of facilitating and lubricating buyer-supplier relations which retain an underlying rationale: competition between individual actors over the distribution of value added.",1999"Stoloff, JA; Glanville, JL; Bienenstock, EJ",Women's participation in the labor force: the role of social networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,"Network research about employment outcomes has rarely focused on women.

We examine the effects of a woman's general network structure on her employment status, rather than focusing on the characteristics of the specific network tie that connected her to a job. Using an innovative, yet simple, measure to capture network diversity, we test network explanations of why women are in the paid labor force, controlling for background, structural, and family composition variables. In general, we find that the greater the quality and diversity of the social resources that are available through a woman's social network, the more likely she is to be working for pay. We also find evidence that suggests disadvantaged women with children must also rely on their social support networks for childcare to enter the labor market.

Second, the anchoring points at any given geographical location are the work sites where immigrants find employment. Thus, labor market conditions structure where immigrants go and where they stay. Third, new geographical locations are often accessed through the ""strength of weak ties,"" leading to geographic dispersion.

If the game provides an option to emit (or to refuse to play), strategies bused on ""projection"" (of a player's intentions) and ""detection"" (of the intentions of a stranger) can confer a ""cooperator's advantage."" Yet previous research has nor found a way for these strategies to evolve from a random start or to recover from invasion by aggressive strategies that feign trustworthiness. We use computer simulation to show how trust and cooperation between strangers can evolve without formal or informal social controls.

The literature on economic organization of hospitals, one of the most developed branches of health services research, still has only weak ties to economic theory. Evolving physician-hospital organizations do not fit into existing frameworks based on horizontal integration, vertical integration, or diversification. Empirical research has primarily focused on horizontal integration, and cause-effect relationships are often obscured by models that depart from economic theory and lack controls for self-selection bias. Recent empirical studies indicate that hospital mergers had moderate, rather than dramatic, effects on the rate of change in operating costs, staffing, and scale. Mergers rarely resulted in hospital closure, but were as likely to result in acute care consolidation and restructuring as in conversion to nonacute inpatient uses. While administrative costs were higher in for-profit than non-profit system hospitals, total costs were similar. System hospitals had lower marginal and average costs per stay than independent hospitals. Hospital vertical integration into subacute care was largely an artifact of the governmental uniform pricing system, which encouraged vertical integration. Hospitals that shared governance or financial risks with physicians outperformed those with high levels of physician governance and financial integration (e.g. stock ownership). Formal physician-hospital organizational arrangements often served to coordinate managed care contracting or to forge links with primary care group practices.

In a 1988 survey in Tianjin, I find that (1) jobs are acquired through strong ties more frequently than through weak ties, (2) both direct and indirect ties are used to obtain help from job-assigning authorities, (3) job-seekers and their ultimate helpers are indirectly connected through intermediaries to whom both are strongly tied, and (4) job-seekers using indirect ties are more likely to obtain better jobs than those using direct ties.",1997"Wallace, R; Wallace, D",Socioeconomic determinants of health - Community marginalisation and the diffusion of disease and disorder in the United States,BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL,"This article describes the cascading diffusion of ''inner city problems'' of disease and disorder in the United States-from the huge marginalised inner city communities of the largest municipalities, first along national travel routes to smaller cities, and then from central cities into surrounding more affluent suburbs-following the pattern of the daily journey to work public policies and economic practices which increase marginalisation act to damage the ''weak ties'' of the community social networks which bind central city neighbourhoods into functioning units.

The 'path list' approach is based upon developing data files corresponding with each relevant unit of analysis, stating hypotheses in terms of particular units of analysis, and testing those hypotheses using the relevant data files. Data files are constructed from initial lists of ties using three basic file manipulation operations: (a) concatenating, (b) aggregating, and (c) matching; then, hypotheses are tested by examining associations among the variables in these files. This paper specifically shows how Granovetter's 'weak ties hypothesis' can be tested using the method of path lists.

Nevertheless, there is still a lack of reliable theoretical and empirical concepts of measuring social influence. For analysis of the interpersonal influence the present study combines two different approaches (concept of ego-centered networks and the theory of planned behavior by Ajzen/Fishbein). The study uses a questionnaire with 367 responses from German users and non-users of computer networks. The results point to social networks as a crucial determinant of innovation-decisions, especially in the case of the diffusion of modern communication technology. Not only in the personal core network have early adopters many relations with people who have already adopted the innovation, but also outside of it. In many cases these relations can actually be described as homogeneous, but also as ''weak ties''. The ''innovator's-network'' does not only form a pro-innovative background, but it also turns out to be a source of social influence or social pressure urging others to adopt the innovation.",1997"Bian, YJ; Ang, S",Guanxi networks and job mobility in China and Singapore,SOCIAL FORCES,"Despite the differences in labor market contexts in China and Singapore, survey data reveal that in both countries jobs are channeled through strong ties more frequently than through weak ties.

Three reasons to expect such a tendency are discussed. 1) Employers reward close personal contacts; this is designated the ''ascriptive employer.'' 2) The theory of ''weak ties'' maintains that using informal channels is efficient for job seekers and that employers have trust in information gathered through such channels. 3) Employers search for new employees through informal channels and offer jobs to the employees they believe are the most competent - that is, headhunting. Employees who are headhunted must also be expected to achieve high bargaining power. The findings indicate that the consequences of recruitment channel differ for lower- and higher-level employees. Getting a job through informal channels does not lead to wage advantages for lower-level employees. The highest wages among higher-level employees are obtained by those who have been contacted informally by the employer (that is, headhunted). Employees on this level also receive higher wages than those who are recruited through formal channels if they got their job by directly contacting the employers or indirectly, through weak ties. Those who get a job through weak ties do not have wage advantages compared with those who contact the employer directly or ave headhunted. Thus, the idea that getting a job through weak ties is especially advantageous for employees is not supported.",1997"Constant, D; Sproull, L; Kiesler, S",The kindness of strangers: The usefulness of electronic weak ties for technical advice,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,"People use weak ties-relationships with acquaintances or strangers-to seek help unavailable from friends or colleagues. Yet in the absence of personal relationships or the expectation of direct reciprocity, help from weak ties might not be forthcoming or could be of low quality. We examined the practice of distant employees (strangers) exchanging technical advice through a large organizational computer network. A survey of advice seekers and those who replied was conducted to test hypotheses about the viability and usefulness of such electronic weak tie exchanges. Theories of organizational motivation suggest that positive regard for the larger organization can substitute for direct incentives or personal relationships in motivating people to help others. Theories of weak ties suggest that the usefulness of this help may depend on the number of ties, the diversity of ties, or the resources of help providers. We hypothesized that, in an organizational context, the firm-specific resources and organizational motivation of people who provide advice will predict the usefulness of advice. We investigated these theories in a study of employees of a global computer manufacturer. We collected survey and observational data on the relationships between information seekers and information providers; the number, diversity, resources, and motivations of information providers, and subjective ratings of the usefulness of the advice (from both parties in the exchange) and whether or not the advice solved information seekers' problems. We found that information providers gave useful advice and solved the problems of information seekers, despite their lack of a personal connection with the seekers. The data support the main hypotheses and provide some support for resource and diversity explanations of weak tie influence. We discuss how this organization's culture sustained useful information exchange through weak ties.",1996"Henning, C; Lieberg, M",Strong ties or weak ties? Neighbourhood networks in a new perspective,SCANDINAVIAN HOUSING & PLANNING RESEARCH,"The purpose of this article is to explore the structure and content of locally based neighbourhood networks. Instead of assuming that more and deeper neighbourhood relations are obviously better, we consider the role that social relations among neighbours actually plays in people's daily lives. The empirical results presented in this article are based on two case studies conducted in a Swedish housing area in 1983, and a follow up study in 1993. The results indicate that as long as we focus only on strong ties, the neighbourhood-in comparison to other arenas like family, relatives, work mates, and close friends-is of less importance for most people. But if we also consider the number of weak ties, defined as unpretentious everyday contacts, the local arena seems to be of significant importance for many people. The neighbourhood is proved to be a suitable arena for weak ties, because proximity and continuity, which promote the development of these kind of social contacts, are easily established in the vicinity.",1996"Wellman, B; Salaff, J; Dimitrova, D; Garton, L; Gulia, M; Haythornthwaite, C","Computer networks as social networks: Collaborative work, telework, and virtual community",ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY,"When computer networks link people as well as machines, they become social networks. Such computer-supported social networks (CSSNs) are becoming important bases of virtual communities, computer-supported cooperative work, and telework. Computer-mediated communication such as electronic mail and computerized conferencing is usually text-based and asynchronous. It has limited social presence, and on-line communications are often more uninhibited, creative, and blunt than in-person communication. Nevertheless, CSSNs sustain strong, intermediate, and weak ties that provide information and social support in both specialized and broadly based relationships. CSSNs foster virtual communities that are usually partial and narrowly focused, although some do become encompassing and broadly based. CSSNs accomplish a wide variety of cooperative work, connecting workers within and between organizations who are often physically dispersed. CSSNs also link teleworkers from their homes or remote work centers to main organizational offices. Although many relationships function off-line as well as on-line, CSSNs have developed their own norms and structures. The nature of the medium both constrains and facilitates social control. CSSNs have strong societal implications, fostering situations that combine global connectivity, the fragmentation of solidarities, the de-emphasis of local organizations (in the neighborhood and workplace), and the increased importance of home bases.",1996"Volker, B; Flap, H","The effects of institutional transformation on personal networks. East Germany, four years later",NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES,"The effects of the fall of the communist regime on the personal networks of people in former communist societies have been predicted with the help of the theory of social capital. In a society with a command economy and a Leninist party organization, personal networks are instrumental in solving two everyday problems specific to communist societies: how to acquire goods in shea supply and whom to trust. As people invest in each other with an eye to the instrumental value of future help, the demise of communism, because of a change in the instrumental value of social ties, has induced a change in personal networks. They have become more homogeneous with regard to occupation and education, since it is no longer necessary to have a heterogenous network for the exchange of scarce goods. Because of the political control during the communist era, people did not know whom to trust, except for those with whom they had intense, stable ties, strongly embedded in dense networks. They were careful in contacts with people they did not know very well. Now the density of the core of strong ties is apt to decrease, whereas the density of the non-core is apt to increase. As long as people are uncertain about what is in their best interest, they will not create new ties. Once the social situation stabilizes, the number of weak ties is apt to rise, since the risk of weak ties is gone. Our data were collected in 1992 and 1993 among a random sample in Leipzig and Dresden. In 1993, the 1992 respondents (n=189) were interviewed again together with a new sample (n=300). The results are in line with our argument: personal networks did become smaller, the density of core networks is decreasing and the occupational and educational homogeneity has increased. A comparison of the networks of our GDR citizens to those of citizens of some Western democratic countries suggests network patterns which might be typical of socialist countries.",1995"PICKERING, JM; KING, JL","HARDWIRING WEAK TIES - INTERORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION, OCCUPATIONAL COMMUNITIES, AND ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE",ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,"Interorganizational computer-mediated communication (ICMC) is expanding rapidly through the Internet and other elements of infrastructure. ICMC can be expected to evolve into the mainstream of existing communications infrastructure, but this evolution is not occurring uniformly across organizations. ICMC infrastructure appears to be most strongly supported, at least in this early stage, among organizations dependent on the maintenance of external weak social ties among employees who are members of professional, dispersed occupational communities. This can be seen in the experience of research-oriented organizations. Two strong forces-the professionalism of key occupational communities seeking autonomy, and a persistent desire by organizations to reduce fixed costs and organizational size-are posited as encouraging growth of ICMC infrastructure. Such growth might provide an important ''bootstrapping mechanism'' of long-predicted shifts from hierarchical to market forms of organization, at least in professionalized sectors of the economy.",1995"NEWELL, S; SWAN, J",PROFESSIONAL-ASSOCIATIONS AS IMPORTANT MEDIATORS OF THE INNOVATION PROCESS,SCIENCE COMMUNICATION,"Innovation depends on new ideas entering an organization and being translated into something implemented and used.

One potentially important network is formed by professional associations, which diffuse a specific body of knowledge to practitioners and create informal networks of weak ties, linking members from different organizations. A survey of a particular association's members is used to identify the variables that predict the level of two types of technological innovation. Results show that professional association networks are important for innovation in specific, operational technologies, although infernal communication factors and organization size are also significant predictors For more complex technologies that have implications for the overall philosophy of operations, different predictors-the existence of a technology strategy, the level of external communication, and the level of influence of individuals-are relevant.",1995"MEYERSON, EM","HUMAN-CAPITAL, SOCIAL CAPITAL AND COMPENSATION - THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF SOCIAL CONTACTS TO MANAGERS INCOMES",ACTA SOCIOLOGICA,In this study the additional effect of social capital over and above the contribution of human capital on the income attainment of managers is explored.

Unemployed individuals find jobs through strong ties (intragroup social interaction), weak ties (random intergroup interaction), and formal channels. Holding constant the total level of social interaction, the author examines how a change in the composition of social interaction affects the steady-state equilibrium. An increase in weak-tie interactions reduces inequality, thereby creating a more equitable distribution of employment across groups. Moreover, an increase in weak-tie interactions increases the steady-state employment rate if inbreeding by employment status among weak ties is sufficiently low.",1994"COUCH, SR; KROLLSMITH, S","ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROVERSIES, INTERACTIONAL RESOURCES, AND RURAL COMMUNITIES - SITING VERSUS EXPOSURE DISPUTES",RURAL SOCIOLOGY,"Differences in the types of social conflict occuring in facility siting disputes and toxic contamination cases are compared. An ecological-symbolic perspective and the concept of strong and weak ties are used to interpret the nature of social conflict in two rural Pennsylvania communities and in cases in the literature. Overall, community solidarity appears likely to be enhanced in siting disputes and undermined in exposure situations. To explain this, two conflict paths are developed that move from the presence or absence of the hazard agent to individual perceptions, the generation of collective threat beliefs and the formation of strong ties, the emergence of alternative leadership and its relationship to official authorities, and finally the formation of weak ties. In each case, the type of community conflict results from the nature of the perceived environmental threat and the social process that threat sets in motion. Practical implications for rural community development are discussed.",1994"KIECKER, P; HARTMAN, CL",PREDICTING BUYERS SELECTION OF INTERPERSONAL SOURCES - THE ROLE OF STRONG TIES AND WEAK TIES,"ADVANCES IN CONSUMER RESEARCH, VOL XXI",The construct of social support is used to explore buyers' motivation for selecting interpersonal sources.

It was expected that the process of information diffusion would be related to the quantity of ties. The diffusion of information brought into a clique by external sources that did not belong to any of the target group's cliques was expected to be related to the existing number of weak ties, whereas the diffusion of specific information sent out by internal sources within a clique was expected to be primarily related to the number of strong ties. Furthermore it was expected that the impact of the program would be related to the perceived quality of network ties.

A simple network-based model finds that an incremental increase in the probability that units must be shared between geographically centered classes leads to a sharply nonlinear, system-wide 'phase transition' from stability and localized demand to instability and a 'delocalized' service demand. Implications are explored for the continuing deterioration of the fire service in New York City and its considerable consequences for both public health and public order.

A formal model shows that both formulations imply a correlation between network composition and a job seeker's minimum acceptable wage. However, the use of a weak tie is never associated with higher expected wages under the first formulation, and is only sometimes associated with higher expected wages under the second formulation.

The theory combines an image of social network structure with the concept of natural selection to model changes in group composition over time. We consider the group to be a population of members subject to natural selection in sociodemographic space. According to the theory, the probability that members will enter or leave the group depends upon the number and strength of social network ties that connect group members to each other and to nonmembers. We analyze an event history dataset constructed from interviews using Life History Calendar method and information on ego-centered social networks developed from the General Social Survey Network Module. We test the hypothesis that network connections inside a group are associated with reduced membership turnover, while connections outside the group increase turnover.

A closer examination of metric and morphologic skeletal and dental traits suggests he erred on both points. While craniometric analyses show the Pre-Koniag and Koniag are markedly different, nonmetric cranial and dental trait frequencies indicate a close relationship between these populations. Craniometric data also suggest the Pre-Koniag were aligned with Yupik Eskimos while the Koniag were largely distinctive, with only weak ties to Aleut and Na-Dene groups. Nonmetric cranial traits indicate the Pre-Koniag and Koniag were related to Yupik groups from southwest Alaska. The distinctive craniometric features of the Koniag may reflect admixture with neighbouring non-Eskimo populations, but cranial deformation, present in the Koniag but essentially absent in the Pre-Koniag, may also contribute to the different opinions on the taxonomic placement of the prehistoric Koniag among northern populations.

Hence outcomes depend on the network of social ties that channel the chain reactions. However, structural analysis is encumbered by the assumption that thresholds derive from changing marginal returns on investments in public goods. A learning-theoretic specification imposes less stringent assumptions about the rationality of the actors and is much better suited to a structural analysis. Computer simulations suggest that threshold effects may be the key to solving the coordination problem: When individual choices are contingent on participation by others, this interdependence facilitates the coordination of contributions needed to shift the bistable system from a noncooperative equilibrium to a cooperative one. Further simulations with low-density networks show that these chain reactions require bridges that link socially distant actors, supporting Granovetter's case for the strength of weak ties.",1991"COHEN, SM",TO STRENGTHEN WEAK TIES - THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT AND THE COUNTRY OF ISRAEL,DEEPENING THE COMMITMENT : ZIONISM AND THE CONSERVATIVE MASORI MOVEMENT,,1990"MARYANSKI, AR",AFRICAN APE SOCIAL-STRUCTURE - IS THERE STRENGTH IN WEAK TIES,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,1987"GRANOVETTER, M",CITATION CLASSIC - THE STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES,CURRENT CONTENTS/ARTS & HUMANITIES,,1986"GRANOVETTER, M",CITATION-CLASSIC - THE STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES,CURRENT CONTENTS/SOCIAL & BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES,,1986"MARYANSKI, AR",GORILLA SOCIAL-STRUCTURE - IS THERE STRENGTH IN WEAK TIES,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,,1986"HANSELL, S","COOPERATIVE GROUPS, WEAK TIES, AND THE INTEGRATION OF PEER FRIENDSHIPS",SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY QUARTERLY,,1984"FARARO, TJ",BIASED NETWORKS AND THE STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,1983"MCPHERSON, JM; SMITHLOVIN, L",WOMEN AND WEAK TIES - DIFFERENCES BY SEX IN THE SIZE OF VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,,1982"FRIEDKIN, NE",INFORMATION-FLOW THROUGH STRONG AND WEAK TIES IN INTRA-ORGANIZATIONAL SOCIAL NETWORKS,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,1982"FRIEDKIN, N",A TEST OF STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF GRANOVETTER STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES THEORY,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,1980"GANS, HJ",GANS ON GRANOVETTERS STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES - COMMENT,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,,1974"GRANOVETTER, M",STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES - REPLY,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,,1974"GANS, HJ",STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES - REPLY,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,,1974"GRANOVETTER, MS",THE STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,,1973"LIU, WT; DUFF, RW",STRENGTH IN WEAK TIES,PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY,,1972

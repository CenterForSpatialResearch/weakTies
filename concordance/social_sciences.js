    "Year": 1995,
    "Abs": "Previous research has suggested that individuals benefit from having associates who are similar to themselves on a variety of dimensions. This article develops a theoretical basis for predicting which types of similarity are most important in determining whether associates will be sources of social support or interpersonal stress. Drawing upon theories of homophily and reference groups, we suggest that experiential similarity (e.g., having experienced a similar status transition) is more important than structural similarity (e.g., similarity of age, gender, marital status) in determining sources of emotional support and stress following life events. The theoretical arguments are supported by data from two separate longitudinal studies of social networks following status transitions; specifically, returning to school and becoming the primary caregiver to an elderly parent."

    "Title": "Racial attraction or racial avoidance in American suburbs?",
    "Year": 1998,
    "Abs": "The principle of homophily homophily is central to several social-science theories. When applied to the study of population change in geographic areas, these theories predict racial homogeneity in residential settlement patterns. The concentration of one group in an area is expected to attract same-group members while deterring others. We examine this prediction using data on 1980-90 population change for four ethnic groups in 1,672 U.S. suburban cities. The findings from our analysis contradict the principle of homophily. For example, during the 1980s, black populations grew faster in those suburbs that had smaller, rather than larger, percentages of blacks. We explain these findings by spatial-assimilation and place-stratification models, Minority suburbanization is viewed as a process driven primarily by status rather than by ethnic considerations."

    "Year": 1998,
    "Abs": "Our research in San Francisco and Bangkok was purposely designed to achieve both applied and theoretical results. Specially, we analyzed the extent to which relatively more effective and relatively less effective HIV/AIDS prevention programs in San Francisco and Bangkok use diffusion of innovations theory (Rogers, 1995) and social marketing theory, (Kotler & Roberto, 1989) in reaching culturally unique populations. We trace the history of HIV/AIDS in San Francisco and Bangkok and indicate why it is relevant to study the application of these two theoretical models to culturally-unique populations. Our findings indicate that key concepts of the diffusion of innovations model (for example, homophily) and social marketing theory (for example, audience segmentation) are especially important in designing culturally sensitive and effective HIV/AIDS prevention programs. Implications of our results for practitioners are outlined here. In sum, when working with culturally unique populations to prevent the spread of HIV, program administrations should: (1) segment their audience clearly and attempt to offer. depth rather than breadth iii the types of people reached, (2) use outreach workers who are either homophilous with the intended audience members or are opinion leaders in the community, and (3) create a program that is compatible with the values and beliefs of the audience members.

    "Abs": "Objective. Even though schools are characterized by an unprecedented amount of racial diversity, it is unclear whether a racially diverse student body necessarily translates into friendships between adolescents from different racial groups. We examine how schools structure adolescent racial homophily, that is, adolescents' tendency to form friendships with students who are similar with respect to race. Methods. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examine how the racial composition of schools influences the chances of having an interracial friendship for U.S. adolescents in grades seven through twelve. Results. Our results demonstrate that white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American adolescents differ greatly in their chances of having an interracial friendship. They additionally demonstrate that adolescents' chances of having an interracial friendship increase dramatically as the proportion of same-race students in their schools decreases. Finally, they suggest that school racial composition accounts for a large part of the variation in interracial friendship by race, but not for all of it. Conclusions. We conclude that racial differences in interracial friendship reflect opportunities and preferences for interracial contact."

Although some have been resegregated into relatively poorly rewarded jobs seen as suitable for women, some have found better jobs or jobs usually seen as \"men's work.\" We trace these variable outcomes to the flexibility of ideas about jobs and gender, the greater power of ideas about gender relationships, the tension between gender homophily and gender status expectations, relationships to clients and targets (people dealt with for the client), and client and target gender. Gender ideas, inequality, and segregation are both reproduced and revised in the security industry."

    "Abs": "The tendency for relationships to weaken and disappear I discuss as decay, and functions describing the rate of decay over time I discuss as decay functions. Three conclusions are supported with 4 years of network data on a study population of bankers and their colleagues in a financial organization. (1) Factors known from cross-sectional evidence to be associated with strong relationships are associated with slow decay; decay is slower in relations between colleagues with a strong prior relationship (inertia), working in the same corporate division (homophily), prominent in the social hierarchy of bankers (status), or connected indirectly through many third parties (embedding). (2) Regardless of slower decay in certain relations, decay has a pattern over time similar to the population ecology \"liability of newness\" attributed to selection and learning, with the added complication of networks and people aging simultaneously. Decay is a power function of time in which the probability of decay decreases with tie age (years for which a relationship has existed) and node age (years for which a banker has been in the study population). (3) Embedding stability is responsible for the greater stability of older relationships. The decay-inhibiting effects of age occur where embedding is disrupted but not where embedding is continuous. The third conclusion is interesting in highlighting the first derivative of social structure as a causal variable: embedding has to be measured for its change, rather than level, to see both of its distinct effects on relationship decay.

Using a national sample of individual's personal networks, the paper reveals that transitivity explains a majority of cases of network integration with two important caveats: (1) recent work on networks and social structure points to important structural constraints on personal networks that shape their formation, and (2) homophily (e.g, sex or race) and choice homophily (e.g. religion) improve the likelihood of integration in personal networks.

    "Title": "Birds of a feather: Homophily in social networks",
    "Year": 2001,
    "Abs": "Similarity breeds connection. This principle-the homophily principle-structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve."

    "Year": 2001,
    "Abs": "Dynamic network models based on the homophily principle are criticized for neglecting organizational context conditions and the impact of role structures on the evolution of intra-organizational trust networks. Using a neo-institutional framework it is argued that individuals in competitive environments will attempt to reduce uncertainty about the trustworthiness of potential trustees by imitating the sociometric choice behavior of persons in similar network positions. Three hypotheses are developed. The positional trust hypothesis predicts that individuals tend to trust other actors who occupy a similar network position as themselves. The mimetic trust hypothesis argues that individuals trust actors who are trusted by persons in their own network position. Finally, the advisory trust hypothesis claims that individuals prefer to maintain trust relations to persons occupying a position of third party intermediary than to persons in other positions. An exploratory empirical test of the hypotheses is carried out by reanalyzing a longitudinal network study of the relationships among 25 salesmen in the furniture department of a North American retail sales store during the 1950s. Blockmodelling procedures are used to identify structural positions in the networks, and log-linear analysis is applied to determine stability of choices within and between structural positions. The results support the mimetic trust and the advisory trust hypothesis."

An analytic model, informed by detailed knowledge of the setting, yielded estimates that indicate that (1) social networks have substantial effects even after unobserved factors (e.g., homophily) that may determine social networks are controlled; (2) controlling for these unobserved factors may substantially alter the estimated effects of networks (these controls were not used in previous studies); (3) network effects are important for both men and women; and (4) network effects are nonlinear and asymmetric, suggesting that networks provide information primarily through social learning, rather than by exerting social influence."

    "Year": 2002,
    "Abs": "Since Simmel's early work on forms of association, the processes guiding group composition have commanded considerable attention in structural sociology, but have not led to a general methodology for examining compositional properties. By introducing a structural event approach, this study offers a new technique that is not restricted to analysis of dyads or triads nor post hoc analysis of those structural arrangements that are observed in a given sample. The approach is illustrated using data on 745 organizational founding teams. Structural event analysis separates choice behavior guiding team composition (with respect to ascribed and achieved characteristics of members) from structurally-induced behavior based on contact opportunities. Results suggest that the strong impact of ascriptive homophily may be tempered where functional considerations of group composition are addressed. However, many of the other arrangements that ostensibly pass as 'functional' are in fact induced by opportunity structures. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

In order to examine the network structure within school classes, we focused in particular on the principle of homophily, i.e.the tendency that people associate with similar others. When differences between classes were observed, it was investigated whether these were related to group compositional characteristics. A two-stage regression procedure is proposed to analyze social networks of multiple groups. The random coefficient model is discussed briefly as an alternative to the two-stage method.

    "Year": 2003,
    "Abs": "Why do different kinds of people like different kinds of culture? Two answers to this question are formally analyzed and empirically tested: the homophily model and the distancing model. Computer simulation demonstrates that these models are alternative explanations for the finding that different cultural tastes and practices are concentrated within different sociodemographic segments of society. Conflicting implications of the two models are identified. Although both models predict that cultural forms compete for people (i.e., people are a scarce resource on which cultural forms depend), the distancing model differs from the homophily model in that the distancing model predicts a dual ecology: Not only do cultural forms compete for people, but people compete for cultural forms. According to the distancing model, the larger the segment of society in which a cultural form is liked, the smaller is the proportion of people in that segment of society who like that cultural form. The homophily model predicts that people do not compete for cultural forms. Instead, it predicts a local bandwagon effect: The larger the segment of society in which a cultural form is liked, the larger is the proportion of people in that segment of society who like that cultural form. An empirical test using 1993 General Social Survey data supports the prediction of both models that cultural forms compete for people. The analysis also reveals a local bandwagon effect, yielding further empirical support for the homophily model and disconfirming the distancing model's prediction of a dual ecology."

    "Year": 2003,
    "Abs": "The mechanisms governing the composition of formal social groups (e.g., task groups, organizational founding teams) remain poorly understood, owing to (1) a lack of representative sampling from groups found in the general population, (2) a \"success\" bias among researchers that leads them to consider only those groups that actually emerge and survive, and (3) a restrictive focus on some theorized mechanisms of group composition (e.g., homophily) to the exclusion of others. These shortcomings are addressed by analyzing a unique, representative data set of organizational founding teams sampled from the U.S. population. Rather than simply considering the properties of those founding teams that are empirically observed, a novel quantitative methodology generates the distribution of all possible teams, based on combinations of individual and relational characteristics. This methodology permits the exploration of five mechanisms of group composition-those based on homophily. functionality, status expectations, network constraint, and ecological constraint. Findings suggest that homophily and network constraints based on strong ties have the most pronounced effect on group composition. Social isolation (i.e., exclusion from a group) is more likely to occur as a result of ecological constraints on the availability of similar alters in a locality than as a result of status-varying membership choices."

I argue that homophily preferences and status expectations are the general cognitive processes that produce the effects of \"tokenism,\" which were originally identified by Kanter for female tokens. These processes also lead to differences in the experiences of male and female tokens. I use qualitative data on 76 Wall Street professionals to illustrate how homophily and status processes maintain and reproduce stratification in securities firms. Moreover, the compensation system in this industry, which rewards employees based on performance evaluations, aggravates the effects of these cognitive processes. Strong mentors, the possession of specialized skills, and objective performance indicators seem to mitigate these effects for a minority of women."

    "Year": 2004,
    "Abs": "Random and biased net theory, introduced by Rapoport and others in the 1950s, is one of the earliest approaches to the formal modeling of social networks. In this theory, intended as a theory of large-scale networks, ties between nodes derive both from random and non-random events of connection. The non-random connections are postulated to arise through \"bias\" events that incorporate known or suspected systematic tendencies in tie formation, such as, mutuality or reciprocity, transitivity or closure in triads, and homophily-the overrepresentation of ties between persons who share important socio-demographic attributes like race/ethnicity or level of educational attainment. A key problem for biased net theory has been analytical intractability of the models. Formal derivations require approximation assumptions and model parameters have been difficult to estimate. The accuracy of the derived formulas and the estimated parameters has been difficult to assess. In this paper, we attempt to address long-standing issues in biased net models stemming from their analytical intractability. We first reformulate and clarify the definitions of basic biases. Second, we derive from first principles the triad distribution in a biased net, using two different analytical strategies to check our derivations. Third, we set out a pseudo-likelihood method for parameter estimation of key bias parameters and then check the accuracy of this relatively simple but approximate scheme against the results obtained from the triad distribution derivation.

In this case, spatial proximity in birds is replaced with sociodemographic homophily on an acquired status characteristic among persons.

    "Year": 2005,
    "Abs": "Based on the distinction between expressive and instrumental motives, six theoretical mechanisms for the formation of trust relationships are elaborated and empirically tested. When expressive motives drive tie formation, individuals primarily attach emotional value to social relationships. Three mechanisms have been tested: the homophily, the balancing, and the gossiping effect. When instrumental, control-related, motives drive tie formation, actors strategically establish relationships because of their potential use for the realization of material benefits or the avoidance of material losses. Again, three mechanisms have been tested: the signalling, the sharing group and the structural hole effect. Longitudinal data come from a sociometric panel study of 17 members of the management team of a German paper factory. Actor-oriented statistical modelling shows that all effects significantly affect trust formation separately In a simultaneous test incorporating all six mechanisms, the pattern of structural holes turns out to be the major predictor of network evolution. The implications of structural hole theory for modelling the evolution of intraorganizational networks are discussed."

    "Year": 2005,
    "Abs": "Explanations of gender inequality typically emphasize individual characteristics, the structure of internal labor markets, or pressures from the institutional environment. Extending the structuralist and institutional perspectives, this article argues that the demographic composition of an organization exchange partners can influence the demographic composition of the focal organization when the focal organization is dependent upon its partners. Specifically, law firms with women-led corporate clients increase the number of partners who are women attorneys. Data on elite law firms and their publicly traded clients support a bargaining power hypothesis whereby law firms promote women attorneys when their corporate clients have women in three key leadership positions: general (legal) counsel, chief executive officer and board director These effects are stronger when the law firm has few clients, reinforcing the hypothesis that interorganizational influence is more vital when a focal organization is dependent on its exchange partner. The results also support a related explanation based on homophily theory. The analysis rules out several alternative explanations and establishes a relationship between the presence of women-led clients and the promotion of women attorneys in law firms."

Analyses of predictors of externalizing peer exposure supported a homophily hypothesis for girls. Tests of peer contagion effects varied by sex, and exposure to externalizing peers predicted multiple problem behaviors for girls but not for boys. Sex differences were a function of children's own sex, but not of peers sex. The study provides evidence of externalizing peer exposure effects in a low-risk sample of young children, notably for girls."

Four alternative logics of attachment - accumulative advantage, homophily, follow-the-trend, and multiconnectivity - are tested to explain the structure and dynamics of interorganizational collaboration in biotechnology. Using multiple novel methods, the authors demonstrate how different rules for affiliation shape network evolution. Commercialization strategies pursued by early corporate entrants are supplanted by universities, research institutes, venture capital, and small firms. As organizations increase their collaborative activities and diversify their ties to others, cohesive subnetworks form, characterized by multiple, independent pathways. These structural components, in turn, condition the choices and opportunities available to members of a field, thereby reinforcing an attachment logic based on differential connections to diverse partners."

We show, against expectations, that there is little evidence of homophily in these recreational practices, which indicates that informal social contacts may be especially important in generating \"bridging\" and \"boundary-spanning\" types of social capital. We use the evidence to argue the need for a \"sociology of companionship\" which highlights routine sociability around recreational practices."

By analyzing a model and tennis players' partnership networks, we show that combination of vertex fitness and homophily yields a VIP-club made of elite vertices that are influential but not easily accessed from the majority. Intentionally formed VIP members can even serve as masterminds, which manipulate hubs to control the entire network without exposing themselves to a large mass. If based on network topology only, elites are not distinguished from many other vertices. Understanding network data is far from sufficient; individualistic factors greatly affect network structure and functions per se. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

First, we use a “network sampling method”to estimate the characteristic path length of one of Korea’s most popular and largest online social networks, the Cyworld “ilchon\", network, or friendship network. Second, we measure homophily tendencies exhibited by Cyworld users in terms of gender, age, and region, using log-linear models. Results show that the Cyworld friendship network is a small world where most of the users are connected to one another by an average of 4.3 degrees and where homophilious tendencies are strongest for region and weakest for gender. The inferred characteristic path length of the Cyworld friendship network approximates that of the offline letter experiment conducted in Korea, a replication of the well-known small world experiment conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960’s. The results are in line with prior research and suggest that online social relations reflect offline social relations and support the view that online and offline social spaces interpenetrate."

Referrals from current employee contacts reduce voluntary turnover while referrals from nonemployees do not provide a turnover advantage. White and minority contacts yield similar levels of job turnover and both generate lower levels of turnover than noncontacts, a finding that lends partial support to social capital theory. Finally, I find modest support for homophily theory; compared to race-mismatched contact-applicant dyads, race-matched dyads have lower levels of voluntary turnover but similar levels of involuntary turnover The results illustrate the lasting effects of race-based social networks. I propose suggestions for designing research that can further our understanding of the mechanisms allegedly at work in the race, social network, and job turnover relationship."

Blending occurs when friendship patterns of multiracials are somewhere in-between those of their monoracial counterparts. Amalgamation consists of friendship patterns that are similar to one of their monoracial counterparts. All groups exhibit signs of amalgamation such that non-white multiracials resemble Blacks, and White multiracials resemble whites except for Black-White multiracials. Black-Whites, Asian-Whites, and Asian-Blacks also exhibit signs of blending, while only Native American multiracials show signs of homophily. Multiracials have different experiences depending on their specific racial composition, and while they seem to bridge the distance between racial groups, their friendship patterns also fall along Black and White lines.

    "Year": 2007,
    "Abs": "This paper investigates bandwagon dynamics in social networks, using an extension of Granovetter's (1978) threshold model. The focus is on the pattern of social ties connecting actors with different participation thresholds. A benchmark model, in which actors' thresholds are similar to their neighbors' thresholds, is built from the principle of homophily. Computational experiments show that participation levels increase when network structure departs from pure homophily, such that actors have new neighbors with discrepant thresholds. Further increasing the heterogeneity of network neighbors causes the bandwagon effects to wane, however, suggesting that bandwagon dynamics are maximized when there is a balance of heterogeneity and homogeneity in social networks. This principle is consistent with insights from several empirical studies and consistent with the conclusions of other formal models."

    "Year": 2008,
    "Abs": "A long-standing objective of friendship research is to identify the effects of personal preference and structural opportunity on intergroup friendship choice. Although past studies have used various methods to separate preference from opportunity, researchers have not yet systematically compared the properties and implications of these methods. This study puts forward a general framework for discrete choice, where choice probability is specified as proportional to the product of preference and opportunity. To implement this framework, the authors propose a modification to the conditional logit model for estimating preference parameters free from the influence of opportunity structure and then compare this approach to several alternative methods for separating preference and opportunity used in the friendship choice literature. As an empirical example, the authors test hypotheses of homophily and status asymmetry in friendship choice using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The example also demonstrates the approach of conducting a sensitivity analysis to examine how parameter estimates vary by specification of the opportunity structure."

    "Year": 2008,
    "Abs": "While many models have investigated the role of competitive mate selection processes in human marriage, few have addressed the potential for assortative processes to explain the observed demographics, as well as simultaneously investigating divorce. To explore the possibility that assortative mate selection processes may explain patterns of both marriage and divorce, we developed an agent-based model, MADAM (Marriage and Divorce Annealing Model), based on homophilic trait matching, in which individuals search for mates similar to themselves, but relax these expectations as they age. MADAM assumes individuals live in a world with N mate-relevant traits, where each individual chooses a set of k traits from those N to represent his or her identity. Individuals seek marriage partners with some number of identical traits, but over time relax their expectations for this desired threshold number of matching traits. Divorce is allowed when individuals find a partner who shares more traits with them than their current partner. With this implementation, we explored how population heterogeneity and individual differences affect population-level demographic trends, finding that increasing population heterogeneity and a reduction in the rate of relaxing expectations can both increase the mean age at first marriage. MADAM also accurately predicts demographic marriage and divorce data across cultures, with quantitatively accurate predictions for length of first marriage, likelihood of first marriage ending in divorce, and percent of population married by the end of the lifespan."

    "Abs": "We argue that sociological explanations proposed within the social capital framework to explain individual well-being are incomplete because they do not differentiate between interpersonal influence and selection mechanisms, on the one hand, and cognitive intra-personal processes. on the other. To this end. three theoretical models of the dynamic interaction between interpersonal trust and job satisfaction will be used to derive and empirically test six hypotheses. First, according to influence mechanisms, an individual's job satisfaction can be the result of the number of sociometric trust choices he or she receives (popularity effect) or the level of job satisfaction of those actors he/she trusts (contagion effect). Second, selection mechanisms postulate that a focal actor will be more likely to develop interpersonal trust in colleagues with a high job satisfaction (attractiveness effect) or with similar levels of job satisfaction as the focal actor (homophily effect). Third, according to intrapersonal spillover mechanisms, a high level of job satisfaction can either facilitate the creation of interpersonal trust relationships (satisfaction spillover effect), or individuals initiating a high number of interpersonal trust relationships can exhibit higher levels of satisfaction (trust spillover effect). To simultaneously test these six hypotheses, longitudinal intra-organizational social network data from a Dutch housing company (n = 57) were used. We found a significant contagion effect, but no support for a popularity effect or either selection effect. Moreover, contrary to what we expected, employees with a low level of job satisfaction were significantly more likely to develop trust relationships with others."

    "Abs": "Homophily, the tendency for similar individuals to associate, is one of the most robust findings in social science. Despite this robustness, we have less information about how personal characteristics relate to differences in the strength of homophily. Nor do we know much about the impact of personal characteristics on judgments of relative dissimilarity. The present study compares the strength of age, religious, and educational homophily for male and female non-kin ties using network data from the 1985 General Social Survey. It also compares the patterning of ties among dissimilar alters for both sexes. The results of this exploratory effort indicate that males and females are almost equally homophilous, although religious homophily exerts a stronger influence on females than males. Males and females do, however, differ in their tendency to associate with certain types of dissimilar alters. Education is essentially uniform for both sexes, religious difference is more important for females than males, and those over sixty or under thirty are less different from the middle categories of age for females than for males. The results suggest that males are able to bridge larger areas of social space in their non-kin interpersonal networks and likely accumulate greater social capital as a consequence.

As body mass index increased, the likelihood of being nominated by schoolmates as friends - but not the likelihood of nominating others as friends decreased. This trend was more pronounced among girls. Moreover, similarity in body mass index strongly predicted friendship formation. These findings were not explained by correlates (e.g., academic achievement) of both body size and friendship dynamics. Thus, the connection between body size and high school social relations was largely a function of the stigmatization of heavier body sizes, especially for girls, and of homophily."

    "Abs": "Lau and Murnighan's faultline theory explains negative effects of demographic diversity on team performance as consequence of strong demographic faultlines. If demographic differences between group members are correlated across various dimensions, the team is likely to show a \"subgroup split\" that inhibits communication and effective collaboration between team members. Our paper proposes a rigorous formal and computational reconstruction of the theory. Our model integrates four elementary mechanisms of social interaction, homophily, heterophobia, social influence and rejection into a computational representation of the dynamics of both opinions and social relations in the team. Computational experiments demonstrate that the central claims of faultline theory are consistent with the model. We show furthermore that the model highlights a new structural condition that may give managers a handle to temper the negative effects of strong demographic faultlines. We call this condition the timing of contacts. Computational analyses reveal that negative effects of strong faultlines critically depend on who is when brought in contact with whom in the process of social interactions in the team. More specifically, we demonstrate that faultlines have hardly negative effects when teams are initially split into demographically homogeneous subteams that are merged only when a local consensus has developed."

The analysis indicates that highly similar pairs do show greater than average propensity to form new ties; however, it also finds that tie formation is heavily biased by triadic closure and focal closure, which effectively constrain the opportunities among which individuals may select. In the case of triadic closure, moreover, selection to \"friend of a friend\" status is determined by an analogous combination of individual preference and structural proximity. The authors conclude that the dynamic interplay of choice homophily and induced homophily, compounded over many \"generations\" of biased selection of similar individuals to structurally proximate positions, can amplify even a modest preference for similar others, via a cumulative advantage like process, to produce striking patterns of observed homophily."

Moreover, we find that elite bias and homophily counteract each other in lower-status communities, leading to more diverse boards than would be predicted by homophily alone. We then examine the effects of assortative mixing on political attitudes and collective action, and find weak support for the proposition that associational diversity promotes tolerance and access to information."

One has transitivity and community structure while the other does not.

Bourdieu includes social capital as one of the key relational elements of his social space, but says much less about it than economic or cultural capital, and levels of social capital are rarely measured in his work. Bourdieu is reluctant to focus on the content of social networks as part of his rejection of substantialist thinking. The neglect of substantive networks creates problems for Bourdieu's framework, because many of Bourdieu's core concepts rest upon assumptions about their interactional properties (in particular, the prevalence of homophilous differential association) which are left unexamined. It is argued here that Bourdieu's neglect of the substance of social networks is related to the criticisms that Bourdieu's framework often encounters, and that this neglect bears re-examination, since it is helpful to think of the ways in which differentiated social networks contribute to the development of habitus, help form fields, and so constitute the intersubjective social relations within which sociality, and practice more generally, occur."

New specifications for exponential random graph models. Sociological Methodology 36,99-153] exhibit substantial improvements in model fit compared with the commonly used Markov random graph models. Snijders et al., however, concentrated on non-directed graphs, with only limited extensions to directed graphs. In particular, they presented a transitive closure parameter based on path shortening. In this paper, we explain the theoretical and empirical advantages in generalizing to additional closure effects. We propose three new triadic-based parameters to represent different versions of triadic closure: cyclic effects; transitivity based on shared choices of partners; and transitivity based on shared popularity. We interpret the last two effects as forms of structural homophily, where ties emerge because nodes share a form of localized structural equivalence. We show that, for some datasets, the path shortening parameter is insufficient for practical modeling, whereas the structural homophily parameters can produce useful models with distinctive interpretations. We also introduce corresponding lower order effects for multiple two-path connectivity. We show by example that the in- and out-degree distributions may be better modeled when star-based parameters are supplemented with parameters for the number of isolated nodes, sources (nodes with zero in-degrees) and sinks (nodes with zero out-degrees). Inclusion of a Markov mixed star parameter may also help model the correlation between in- and out-degrees. We select some 50 graph features to be investigated in goodness of fit diagnostics, covering a variety of important network properties including density, reciprocity, geodesic distributions, degree distributions, and various forms of closure. As empirical illustrations, we develop models for two sets of organizational network data: a trust network within a training group, and a work difficulty network within a government instrumentality.

However, there have been few empirical evaluations to determine the important facilitators. In a research partnership with law enforcement agencies, we used dynamic social-network analysis methods to examine several plausible facilitators of co-offending relationships in a large-scale narcotics network consisting of individuals and vehicles. Multivariate Cox regression and a two-proportion z-test on cyclic and focal closures of the network showed that mutual acquaintance and vehicle affillations were significant facilitators for the network under study. We also found that homophily with respect to age, race, and gender were not good predictors of future link formation in these networks. Moreover, we examined the social causes and policy implications for the significance and insignificance of various facilitators including common jails on future co-offending. These findings provide Important Insights into the link-formation processes and the resilience of social networks. In addition, they can be used to aid In the prediction of future links. The methods described can also help in understanding the driving forces behind the formation and evolution of social networks facilitated by mobile and Web technologies."

This project adopts a case study approach and simultaneously tests for propinquity and homophily effects on neighborhood ties by employing a full-network sample from a recently developed New Urbanist neighborhood within a mid-sized southern city. The authors find that physical distance reduces the likelihood of weak or strong ties forming, suggesting the importance of accounting for propinquity when estimating social tie formation. The authors simultaneously find that social distance along wealth reduces the likelihood of weak ties forming. Social distance on life course markers-age, marital status, and the presence of children-reduces the formation of weak ties. Consistent with the systemic model, each additional month of shared residence in the neighborhood increases both weak and strong ties. An important innovation is this study's ability to directly compare the effects of physical distance and social distance, placing them into equivalent units: a 10 percent increase in home value difference is equivalent to a 5.6 percent increase in physical distance."

The results showed no evidence of gender homophily but significant evidence of homophily for ethnicity, religion, age, country, marital status, attitude towards children, sexual orientation, and reason for joining MySpace. There were also some imbalances: women and the young were disproportionately commenters, and commenters tended to have more Friends than commentees. Overall, it seems that although traditional sources of homophily are thriving in MySpace networks of active public connections, gender homophily has completely disappeared. Finally, the method used has wide potential for investigating and partially tracking homophily in society, providing early warning of socially divisive trends."

In addition to baseline descriptors of relational behavior, the chief goals of this study were to examine the degree to which Last. fm relationships are characterized by homophily (and particularly by shared musical taste), the extent to which communication via Last. fm is associated with other forms of communication (both offline and online), how such communication behavior is associated with demographic and relational characteristics, and whether these variables predict strength of relational development. Results indicate that although Last. fm relational partners exhibit shared musical taste, this shared taste is not associated with relational development. Rather, following media multiplexity theory, relational development is strongly and uniquely associated with communication behavior across almost all forms of communication (including Last. fm). These results suggest that shared interests may foster the creation of weak ties, but conversion of these connections to strong ties is relatively rare."

The recent adoption of online communication by many consumers has facilitated a fundamental change to the structure of many WOM interactions by exposing consumers to electronic WOM (eWOM) from virtual strangers. The current study seeks to uncover whether traditional findings on social ties and WOM communication hold for eWOM information.Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 482 college students with varying levels of expertise with eWOM forums, specifically RateMyProfessors.com in the USA. Participants completed a 20-question survey related to university professor and class choice.Findings - The study finds that students seeking information on which professor to take weight the information they obtain from eWOM forums to be equally influential in their decision as their own primary experience with the professor. Furthermore, the information gained from the eWOM forum is more influential in their decision than speaking with friends in person (WOM). While existing research suggests that strong tie referral sources are more influential than weak tie information sources on decision making, this research finds that some weak tie information sources are rated as more influential.Research limitations/implications - A limitation of the study is the focus on one eWOM forum, RateMyProfessors.com. Future research would benefit from expanding the number and type of eWOM forums.Originality/value - While the emergence of the Internet and social networking has spawned an interest in the overall study of eWOM, this study is the first to evaluate eWOM in the context of tie strength, homophily and decision making. The study also investigates whether existing theories of interpersonal communication hold in an online context."

S. social networks is their high degree of racial homogeneity, which is often attributed to racial homophily-the preference for associating with individuals of the same racial background. The authors unpack racial homogeneity using a theoretical framework that distinguishes between various tie formation mechanisms and their effects on the racial composition of networks, exponential random graph modeling that can disentangle these mechanisms empirically, and a rich new data set based on the Facebook pages of a cohort of college students. They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e. g., students from \"elite\" backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily."

Network theory and research has not adequately considered that internalized cultural worldviews might affect network composition. Drawing on a synthetic, dual-process theory of culture and two waves of nationally-representative panel data, this article shows that worldviews are strong predictors of changes in network composition among U.S. youth. These effects arc robust to the influence of other structural factors, including prior network composition and behavioral homophily. By contrast, there is little evidence that networks play a strong proximate role in shaping worldviews. This suggests that internalized cultural dispositions play an important role in shaping the interpersonal environment and that the dynamic link between culture and social structure needs to be reconsidered."

Like friendships among straight students, cross-orientation friendships show a strong homophilous tendency-straight students choose sexual minority friends within their grade levels, racial groups, and academic aptitude levels. Beyond homophily, white race and high levels of academic aptitude and parent education increase straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends in some gender combinations, consistent with previous research showing the links between these backgrounds and positive attitudes toward sexual minorities.

The authors study the phenomenon of homophily in the digital world by answering these central questions. Unlike the physical world, the digital world doesn't impose any geographic or organizational constraints on friendships. So, although online friends might share common interests, a priori there's no reason to believe that two users with common interests are more likely to be friends. Using data from LiveJournal, the authors show that the answer to both questions is yes."

    "Abs": "This paper unites quantitative and qualitative data from the College Social Life Survey (n = 732) to describe and explain patterns of racial homophily in undergraduate sexual/romantic relationships at an elite university, a closed social setting. It expands the literature on interracial romantic unions by comparing homophily in hookups ( uncommitted sexual interactions), dates, and long-term relationships. Although this population embodies many characteristics associated with greater racial mixing ( youth, education, status equality, geographical proximity, racial diversity, independence from family), racial homophily is still strongly evident. Variation in levels of homophily among relationship types and among racial groups is explained by differences in desired homophily, social network segregation, and participation in formal race-based student organizations. Black students are particularly socially isolated."

    "Abs": "Knowledge-sharing online social networks are becoming increasingly pervasive and popular. While the user-to-user interactions in these networks have received substantial attention, the consumption of user generated content has not been studied extensively. In this work, we use data gathered from digg.com to present novel findings and draw important sociological conclusions regarding the intimate relationship between consumption and social networking. We first demonstrate that individuals' consumption habits influence their friend networks, consistent with the concept of homophily. We then show that one's social network can also influence the consumption of a submission through the activation of an extended friend network. Finally, we investigate the level of reciprocity, or balance, in the network and uncover relationships that are significantly less balanced than expected."

    "Year": 2010,
    "Abs": "One of the key structural components of social systems is the social network. The representation of this network structure is key to providing a valid representation of the society under study. The social science concept of homophily provides a conceptual model of how social networks are formed and evolve over time. Previous work described the results of social simulation using a static homophily network. In order to gain the full benefit of modeling societies a representation of how the social network changes over time is required. This paper introduces the implementation of a dynamic homophily network, along with a case study exploring the sensitivity of model outputs to the parameters describing the network and applying social network change detection methods (SNCD) to model output."

Additionally, a fixed seating arrangement was considered as a second element of academy infrastructure capable of impacting racial integration. We examined the consequences of these academy components over time with regard to race by combining ethnographic accounts With social network data collected throughout the academy and using a variety of network analytic tools. These consequences with regard to race were examined as a part of social network evolution. The academy's social arrangements did accelerate the creation of social knowledge of recruits about each other and the formation of friendship ties both within and between races. However. our results point to cleat limitations to such infrastructural engineering and have implications for both recruitment to police academies and dealing with race. They shed light also oil processes of homophily and group composition over time and have implications for Studying social networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Our network model, inspired by that of [Gould, Roger 2002. The origins of status hierarchies: A formal theory and empirical test. American Journal of Sociology 107, 1143-1178], is based on a theoretically informed actor model, in which each network member sets attachment strengths based on perceived partner quality, reciprocity, influence from others, attribute homophily, and attachment resistance. A computer algorithm finds the single robust equilibrium configuration of attachment strengths. This allows us to generate six propositions concerning inequalities at the individual, dyadic, triadic, and network levels. We test the propositions on network data for four kinds of attachments over four waves for five organizations, and find that the results generally support the propositions. The results suggest that partner quality, reciprocity, and attachment resistance are the most important elements in the network members' choices. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Because homophily-the principle that like seeks like-has been suggested as a mechanism by which people interact, it may also provide a mechanism that generates such frequencies and distributions. However, our multi-agent simulation tool, Construct, suggests that a slight supplement to a knowledge homophily model-the inclusion of several highly salient personal facts that are infrequently shared-can more successfully lead to the tiering behavior often observed in human networks than a simplistic homophily model. Our findings imply that homophily on both general and personal facts is necessary in order to achieve realistic frequencies of interaction and distributions of interaction partners. Implications of the model are discussed, and recommendations are provided for simulation designers seeking to use homophily models to explain human interaction patterns."

    "Year": 2011,
    "Abs": "Research on media attention has identified a range of factors that determine whether events are covered as news. However, these determinants have been derived mainly inductively and there is a great variety in their nature and number from one study to the next, partly depending on the type of news events studied. This insufficient theoretical grounding limits the possibilities for research on media attention to connect to wider social-science theorizing. We propose a unifying theoretical framework for studying media attention, which draws on theoretical concepts and research findings from the sociological literature on the diffusion of innovations. Following Rogers' suggestion to see news as a particular type of social innovation, we derive five factors that influence news diffusion from the source location of an event to an adopting medium: event characteristics, homophily between source and adopter, network ties between source and adopter, the power and status of the source, and selective exposure to similar events or to events from the same source. We apply and test this theoretical framework by analysing the coverage of > 1,300 earthquakes in the period 1990-2005 in American, British and Dutch newspapers. Our results strongly and consistently support the theoretical expectations."

Using unique longitudinal personnel data on managers and their subordinates, this study identifies and tests for evidence of three distinct mechanisms by which managers potentially influence the assessment of employee performance in the workplace: (1) social network influence between employees' current and former managers; (2) manager-manager (horizontal) homophily; and (3) manager-employee (vertical) homophily. I find evidence of the independent effects of all three mechanisms of managerial influence on the outcome of disagreement in the performance evaluation ratings of the same worker between former and current managers. In particular, my results stress that both managerial network influence and horizontal homophily affect the process of employee performance assessments, over and above the well-studied vertical homophily mechanism. I conclude by discussing the theoretical implications of these findings for future research regarding the interactional aspects of workplace inequality within contemporary organizations."

    "Abs": "Conventional wisdom holds that friends protect against depression through the social support they provide; however, depression likely has a role in structuring friendship networks. In particular, we investigate friend selection mechanisms responsible for similarity in depression among friends (i.e., homophily). Preference is one explanation, yet several correlates of depression make homophilous selection among depressed individuals unlikely. We propose two alternative mechanisms-avoidance and withdrawal-that can produce depression homophily in the absence of preference. These alternative mechanisms create homophily indirectly by limiting friendship partners available to depressed individuals. We test the preference, avoidance, and withdrawal mechanisms using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and a dynamic network model. Results provide support for the withdrawal mechanism. These findings help explain how depression affects friend selection and have broader implications for understanding selection mechanisms responsible for network patterns such as homophily."

The authors contribute to this literature by considering the social boundary between the religious and the non-religious. Surveys of U.S. adults provide evidence of popular aversion toward the non-religious, but this analysis of the Baylor Religion Survey (2005) shows that the majority of religious Americans report a friendship with someone who is not religious at all. The authors find that such boundary-crossing relationships are largely structured by homophily, opportunities for intergroup contact, and religious barriers to intergroup contact. These findings reveal that some religiously themed conflicts that are common among cultural elites may not be particularly salient in the realm of daily social life."

By multilevel analysis, I obtain two results. First, urban effects have not appeared in homophily of age, education, occupation. Second, urbanism promote homophily of hobbies. These results showed that homophily of hobbies is more important in Japan, and we need to reexamine subcultural theory through sharing hobbies."

The article also examines how hyperlink patterns began to change in 2005 and 2006 when Web 2.0 (blogs) was introduced. A key difference between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 was that the Assembly members were relatively well connected in the blogosphere. Furthermore, prominent Web 1.0 hubs with many links tended to disappear, but butterfly networks based on political homophily emerged. Finally, the hyperlink network of Twitter, a recent Web 2.0 application, is examined. Twitter's network diagram shows that online social ties between politicians are becoming denser."

We provide evidence for this claim in a Monte Carlo analysis of the statistical model used by Christakis, Fowler. and their colleagues in numerous articles estimating \"contagion\" effects in social networks. Our results indicate that homophily in friendship retention induces significant upward bias and decreased coverage levels in the Christakis and Fowler model if there is non-negligible friendship attrition over time.

The overarching goal of the current investigation was to examine whether coparticipating in school-based extracurricular activities supported adolescents' school-based friendships. We used social network methods and data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine whether dyadic friendship ties were more likely to exist among activity coparticipants while controlling for alternative friendship processes, namely dyadic homophily (e.g., demographic and behavioral similarities) and network-level processes (e.g., triadic closure). Results provide strong evidence that activities were associated with current friendships and promoted the formation of new friendships. These associations varied based on school level (i.e., middle vs. high school) and activity type (i.e., sports, academic, arts). Results of this study provide new insight into the complex relations between activities and friendship that can inform theories of their developmental outcomes."

    "Abs": "Online social networking communities may exhibit highly complex and adaptive collective behaviors. Since emotions play such an important role in human decision making, how online networks modulate human collective mood states has become a matter of considerable interest. In spite of the increasing societal importance of online social networks, it is unknown whether assortative mixing of psychological states takes place in situations where social ties are mediated solely by online networking services in the absence of physical contact. Here, we show that the general happiness, or subjective well-being (SWB), of Twitter users, as measured from a 6-month record of their individual tweets, is indeed assortative across the Twitter social network. Our results imply that online social networks may be equally subject to the social mechanisms that cause assortative mixing in real social networks and that such assortative mixing takes place at the level of SWB. Given the increasing prevalence of online social networks, their propensity to connect users with similar levels of SWB may be an important factor in how positive and negative sentiments are maintained and spread through human society. Future research may focus on how event-specific mood states can propagate and influence user behavior in \"real life."

The authors examine two cases: the first, to explore the mechanism's implications and, the second, to demonstrate its utility in analyzing empirical data. In the first, the diffusion of Internet use, network effects increase adoption's benefits to associates of prior adopters. An agent-based model demonstrates positive, monotonic relationships, given externalities, between homophily bias and intergroup inequality in equilibrium adoption rates. In the second, rural-urban migration in Thailand, network effects reduce risk to persons whose networks include prior migrants. Analysis of longitudinal individual-level migration data indicates that network homophily interacts with network externalities to induce divergence of migration rates among otherwise similar villages."

Thus, changes in social networks may be associated with disruption rather moving to a mixed-income site. Vietnamese residents also experienced increases in ethnic diversity compared to English-speaking respondents. The results raise questions about the social mixing intent of such programs. The high expectations for social network benefits of income mixing housing programs should be tempered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "Year": 2011,
    "Abs": "Analyses of social network data have suggested that obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness all travel through social networks. Individuals exert \"contagion effects'' on one another through social ties and association. These analyses have come under critique because of the possibility that homophily from unmeasured factors may explain these statistical associations and because similar findings can be obtained when the same methodology is applied to height, acne, and headaches, for which the conclusion of contagion effects seems somewhat less plausible. The author uses sensitivity analysis techniques to assess the extent to which supposed contagion effects for obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness might be explained away by homophily or confounding and the extent to which the critique using analysis of data on height, acne, and headaches is relevant. Sensitivity analyses suggest that contagion effects for obesity and smoking cessation are reasonably robust to possible latent homophily or environmental confounding; those for happiness and loneliness are somewhat less so. Supposed effects for height, acne, and headaches are all easily explained away by latent homophily and confounding. The methodology that has been used in past studies for contagion effects in social networks, when used in conjunction with sensitivity analysis, may prove useful in establishing social influence for various behaviors and states. The sensitivity analysis approach can be used to address the critique of latent homophily as a possible explanation of associations interpreted as contagion effects."

The authors show that generically, all of these are confounded with each other. Distinguishing them from one another requires strong assumptions on the parametrization of the social process or on the adequacy of the covariates used (or both). In particular the authors demonstrate, with simple examples, that asymmetries in regression coefficients cannot identify causal effects and that very simple models of imitation (a form of social contagion) can produce substantial correlations between an individual's enduring traits and his or her choices, even when there is no intrinsic affinity between them. The authors also suggest some possible constructive responses to these results."

The key objective in establishing and running these online health communities is to offer empathic support to patients. Patients' perceived empathy is considered to be critical in patient recovery, specifically, by enhancing patient's compliance with treatment protocols and the pace of healing. Most online health communities are characterized by two main functions: informational support and social support. This study examines the relative impact of these two distinct functions that is, as an information seeking forum and as a social support forum on patients' perceived empathy in online health communities.Design This study tests the impact of two variables that reflect the above functions of online health communities information seeking effectiveness and perceived social support on perceived empathy. The model also incorporates the potential moderating effect of homophily on these relationships.Measurements A web-based survey was used to collect data from members of the online health communities provided by three major healthcare centers. A regression technique was used to analyze the data to test the hypotheses.Results The study finds that it is the information seeking effectiveness rather than the social support which affects patient's perceived empathy in online health communities run by HCOs. The results indicate that HCOs that provide online health communities for their patients need to focus more on developing tools that will make information seeking more effective and efficient."

We analyse how these patterns are influenced by educational homophily and opportunity structures. Social exchange theory and mate search theory are used to explain online mate selection behaviour. Our results show that educational homophily is the dominant mechanism in online mate choice. Similarity in education significantly increases the rate of both sending and replying to initial contacts. After controlling for the opportunity structure on the platform, the preference for similar educated others is the most important factor, particularly among women. Our results also support the exchange theoretical idea that homophily increases with educational level. If dissimilarity contacting patterns are found, women are highly reluctant to contact partners with lower educational qualifications. Men, in contrast, do not have any problems to contact lower-qualified women. Studies of educational homogamy generally show that couples where women have a higher level of education are rare. Our study demonstrates that this is mainly the result of women's reluctance to contact lower qualified men."

In the diffusion process of information, agents do not simply copy other agents' state variables, but share the target of learning, which is supposed to simulate \"conditional learning\". Network is supposed to be dynamic and links are rewired based on the homophily rule. Dynamic analysis of the model is supposed to show the co-evolution process of network and culture.Simulation results reveal that several groups of culture, which are corresponding to the environmental conditions, are formed when homophilic property of network dynamics is suppressed by constraint on the link rewiring, etc. These results indicate a new mechanism of formation of polarized cultural groups in the community, society and so forth."

We describe a novel application of pervasive computing based on using mobile phone sensors to measure and model the face-to-face interactions and subsequent opinion changes amongst undergraduates, during the 2008 US presidential election campaign. We find that self-reported political discussants have characteristic interaction patterns and can be predicted from sensor data. Mobile features can be used to estimate unique individual exposure to different opinions, and help discover surprising patterns of dynamic homophily related to external political events, such as election debates and election day. To our knowledge, this is the first time such dynamic homophily effects have been measured. Automatically estimated exposure explains individual opinions on election day. Finally, we report statistically significant differences in the daily activities of individuals that change political opinions versus those that do not, by modeling and discovering dominant activities using topic models. We find people who decrease their interest in politics are routinely exposed (face-to-face) to friends with little or no interest in politics."

    "Year": 2011,
    "Abs": "Trust is only one of the types of ties generated by social networks, and arguably not the most important in generating access to the state. The term \"trust networks\" usually refers to social formations characterized by homophily, strong ties, and dense network clustering, which generate the identities and commitments 1 underlying mobilization and civic life. Yet the social networks literature also notes the importance of weak or \"bridging\" ties that span network enclaves and link heterogeneous and contending sets of actors. I argue that it is often distrust, rather than trust, that serves as the vehicle of integration of non-state actors into the democratic polity, via the intersection of partisan and civic engagement. When this is absent we run the risk of state-society relations characterized by clientelism, quiescence, stagnation and balkanization. Using the case of Brazil in the 1980s and 90s, I argue that a healthy democracy depends not just upon the integration of trust-based enclaves into the state - the historical source of corporatist politics - but upon complex civic and partisan networks in which contending institutional logics crosscut and inform each other. While these may generate conflict and tensions, they are also the source of the institutional innovation, contestation, and engagement with state politics that a strong and resilient democracy requires."

We aim to model an item's socialness as a quantitative measure based on the how popular the item is adopted by members of multiple communities. We propose two socialness models, namely Basic and Mutual Dependency, to compute item socialness based on different sets of principles. In developing the Mutual Dependency Model, we demonstrate that items' socialness can be related to the socialness of communities. Our model have been evaluated on a set of users and application items from a mobile social network. We also conducted experiments to study how socialness can be related to network effects such as homophily, social influence and friendship formation."

Restricted network access denies involvement in the exchange and creation of tacit knowledge and ultimately, organizational resources and power. The strength of network ties may also impact upon the quality of knowledge exchanged within networks, its level of complexity and strategic relevance.

    "Year": 2011,
    "Abs": "Modifying M. Granovetters distinction between strong and weak tie friendships, social assimilation of immigrant children will be investigated from a social network perspective. Using data from primary school classes we start from the assumption that particularly close friendships have a positive impact on the process of acculturation. We investigate the role of ethnic homophily in the formation of weak and close friendships between immigrant and native children. In doing so, alternative explanations of friendship formation like social homophily as a mediator of ethnic homophily will be considered measured by similarity of ego and alter in terms of cultural capital \"in the objectified state\". As a result, immigrant children of Turkish origin have friendships with native peers, but these connections tend to be rather weak tie relations. Dyads of two Turkish children, in contrast, chances of close friendships are higher. It will be argued that these results are in line with the concept of selective acculturation of immigrant children of Turkish origin."

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "This article presents culture as a vehicle of labor market sorting. Providing a case study of hiring in elite professional service firms, I investigate the often suggested but heretofore empirically unexamined hypothesis that cultural similarities between employers and job candidates matter for employers' hiring decisions. Drawing from 120 interviews with employers as well as participant observation of a hiring committee, I argue that hiring is more than just a process of skills sorting; it is also a process of cultural matching between candidates, evaluators, and firms. Employers sought candidates who were not only competent but also culturally similar to themselves in terms of leisure pursuits, experiences, and self-presentation styles. Concerns about shared culture were highly salient to employers and often outweighed concerns about absolute productivity. I unpack the interpersonal processes through which cultural similarities affected candidate evaluation in elite firms and provide the first empirical demonstration that shared culture-particularly in the form of lifestyle markers-matters for employer hiring. I conclude by discussing the implications for scholarship on culture, inequality, and labor markets."

    "Abs": "Previous research has documented that the institutional behaviors (e.g., lobbying, campaign contributions) of political organizations reflect the polarization of these organizations along party lines. However, little is known about how these groups are connected at the level of individual party activists. Using data from a survey of 738 delegates at the 2008 Democratic and Republican national conventions, we use network regression analysis to demonstrate that co-membership networks of national party convention delegates are highly polarized by party, even after controlling for homophily due to ideology, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, age, educational attainment, income, and religious participation. Among delegates belonging to the same organization, only 1.78% of these co-memberships between delegates crossed party lines, and only 2.74% of the ties between organizations sharing common delegates were bipartisan in nature. We argue that segregation of organizational ties on the basis of party adds to the difficulty of finding common political ground between the parties."

    "Abs": "This study examines the network structure of policy learning in the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, which is a network of the world's largest cities committed to tackling climate change issues. Among forty members and nineteen affiliate members, we ask the question with whom do cities learn and why? How are policy-learning relationships associated with cities' multi-stakeholder governing body, policy performance, and cultural similarities? While studies on learning have analyzed conditions facilitating learning, quantitative studies of local government learning in global networks are rare. To facilitate the investigation into learning, we conceptualize learning as a process comprising information seeking, adoption and policy change, and focus on information seeking as the foundation step in the learning process. This social network analysis using the exponential random graph model reveals the cities that seek information and those that are information sources are different subgroups. Furthermore, analysis of nodal attributes suggests that transmunicipal learning in the C40 network is facilitated by the presence of a multi-stakeholder governing body; homophily of culture (language and regional proximity); and higher level of climate change policy performance. Creating a multi-stakeholder governing body could ensure participatory representativeness from citizens and relevant stakeholders to enhance climate change policy engagement and decision making as well as policy learning."

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "Longitudinal social network data on adolescents in seven schools are analyzed to reach a new understanding about how the personal and interpersonal social dimensions of adolescent religion intertwine together in small school settings. We primarily address two issues relevant to the sociology of religion and.sociology in general: (1) social selection as a source of religious homophily and (2) friend socialization of religion. Analysis results are consistent with Collins interaction ritual chain theory, which stresses the social dimensions of religion, since network-religion autocorrelations are relatively substantial in magnitude and both selection and socialization mechanisms play key roles in generating them. Results suggest that socialization plays a stronger role than social selection in four of six religious outcomes, and that more religious youth are more cliquish. Implications for our understanding of the social context of religion, religious homophily, and the ways we model religious influence, as well as limitations and considerations for future research, are discussed.

    "Abs": "Local forces structure social networks. One major and widely researched local force is reciprocity, often assumed to work homogeneously across actors-i.e., all actors are equally subject to the same level of force towards reciprocity. Other local forces, like multiplexity and exchange, are also often assumed to apply equally to different actors. But social theory provides us with ample arguments why such forces might be stronger in some subsets of actors than others, or why such forces might affect intergroup ties more than intragroup ties. In this paper we introduce standard measures to capture these group specific forces towards reciprocity, multiplexity, and exchange. All the measures control for differential tendencies of actors to initiate ties of various types. We also introduce a procedure by which differences in the strength of these forces between groups and subgroups can be statistically evaluated."

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "The issue of the influence of norms on behavior is as old as sociology itself. This paper explores the effect of normative homophily (i.e.\"sharing the same normative choices\") on the evolution of the advice network among lay judges in a courthouse. Blau's (1955, 1964) social exchange theory suggests that members select advisors based on the status of the advisor. Additional research shows that members of an organization use similarities with others in ascribed, achieved or inherited characteristics, as well as other kinds of ties, to mitigate the potentially negative effects of this strong status rule. We elaborate and test these theories using data on advisor choice in the Commercial Court of Paris. We use a jurisprudential case about unfair competition (material and \"moral\" damages), a case that we submitted to all the judges of this court, to test the effect of normative homophily on the selection of advisors, controlling for status effects. Normative homophily is measured by the extent to which two judges are equally \"punitive\" in awarding damages to plaintiffs. Statistical analyses combine longitudinal advice network data collected among the judges with their normative dispositions. Contrary to what could be expected from conventional sociological theories, we find no pure effect of normative homophily on the choice of advisors. In this case, therefore, sharing the same norms and values does not have, by itself, a mitigating effect and does not contribute to the evolution of the network. We argue that status effects, conformity and alignments on positions of opinion leaders in controversies still provide the best insights into the relationship between norms, structure and behavior.

    "Title": "An Actor-Based Model of Social Network Influence on Adolescent Body Size, Screen Time, and Playing Sports",
    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "Recent studies suggest that obesity may be \"contagious\" between individuals in social networks. Social contagion (influence), however, may not be identifiable using traditional statistical approaches because they cannot distinguish contagion from homophily (the propensity for individuals to select friends who are similar to themselves) or from shared environmental influences. In this paper, we apply the stochastic actor-based model (SABM) framework developed by Snijders and colleagues to data on adolescent body mass index (BMI), screen time, and playing active sports. Our primary hypothesis was that social influences on adolescent body size and related behaviors are independent of friend selection. Employing the SABM, we simultaneously modeled network dynamics (friendship selection based on homophily and structural characteristics of the network) and social influence. We focused on the 2 largest schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and held the school environment constant by examining the 2 school networks separately (N = 624 and 1151). Results show support in both schools for homophily on BMI, but also for social influence on BMI. There was no evidence of homophily on screen time in either school, while only one of the schools showed homophily on playing active sports. There was, however, evidence of social influence on screen time in one of the schools, and playing active sports in both schools. These results suggest that both homophily and social influence are important in understanding patterns of adolescent obesity. Intervention efforts should take into consideration peers' influence on one another, rather than treating \"high risk\" adolescents in isolation."

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "Women's disadvantages in labor market outcomes are often attributed to the preponderance of men at or near the top of organizational hierarchies. While theories of homophily predict that women in positions of power ameliorate gender differences in wages for employees under them, status characteristics theory suggests that women face comparable disadvantages when working under men and women. Despite the existence of competing theoretical perspectives, there is little empirical work investigating the effect of women in positions of organizational power on gender inequality among their subordinates. This study makes an important contribution to this literature by using employment records from 3,707 employees at a large U.S.-based grocery retailer over nine years to examine how the gender gap in wages varies in establishments with male and female managers. Consistent with status characteristics theory, the authors find no significant differences between male and female managers in terms of gender-based wage inequality among their employees."

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "This study outlines a new explanation for homophily in social networks that is neither intended nor imposed by constraints on partner choices. Rather, homophily is an endogenous product of the emergent exchange process, in which actors seek high-value partners who reciprocate their gestures. Whereas all actors initially direct exchange toward higher value partners, the gestures of lower value actors are more likely to go unreciprocated. This imbalance drives lower value actors to seek new partners, who end up being others who are also lower value. The consequence is homophily on value despite no such preference. I draw upon social exchange theory to articulate how this process unfolds in a newly forming network. A laboratory experiment tests hypotheses about how exchange patterns change over time. Findings reveal that shifts in participants' behavior over time were consistent with a concern for reciprocity, resulting in increasing levels of homophily in the network."

We follow Peter Blau, Miller McPherson, Lynn Smith-Lovin, Duncan Watts and many others in positing that human behavior is best understood in terms of the complex social systems within which actions are taken, and that the representation of these social systems must make evident the endogenous structural constraints on opportunities for interpersonal contact and group affiliation. We further demonstrate that the ability to seed social simulations with representative social data about the society being modeled (e.g. from social surveys), and the use of social networks generated using principles of homophily from empirical social science, provide a compelling and actionable framework for both interpreting with and theory building from whole society simulations."

Using a longitudinal data set of SMO protest activity between 1960 and 1995, the authors adapt novel methods for dealing with two forms of selection and measurement bias in network analysis: (i) the mechanism that renders some SMOs more likely to select into collaboration and (ii) the notion that diffusion is an artifact of homophily or indirect learning rather than influence. The authors find that collaboration is an important channel of tactical diffusion and that SMOs with broader tactical repertoires adopt more tactics via their collaboration with other SMOs, but only up to a point. Engaging in more collaboration also makes SMOs more active transmitters and adopters of new tactics. Finally, initial overlap in respective tactical repertoires facilitates the diffusion of tactics among collaborating SMOs."

Trends towards homophily however, might counteract this effect if actors consistently seek interaction partners with the same background characteristics. In this study we investigate the impact of community level diversity on the cultural diversity of friendship networks. Based on a multilevel analysis of recent survey data from Flanders (Belgium). we demonstrate that community level diversity has a significant but limited impact on ethnic and religious friendship network diversity. Controlling for individual level characteristics, residents of ethnically diverse communities report more ethnically and religiously diverse friendships. The fact that ethnic and religious diversity overlap to such a large extent suggests that both divisions are closely related in contemporary secularized European societies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "Network-based job search is especially likely to foster workplace segregation and limit status attainment when information flows through homophilous ties. This paper takes the perspective of information holders and examines how the use of strong versus weak ties - which tend to be homophilous and heterophilous, respectively - differs with characteristics of labour markets in which jobs are located. Using in-depth interviews with entry-level white collar workers I show that information holders with opportunities to mention specific jobs to specific people do so only 27% of the time. Because they hesitate to share information if they are uncertain the information is specifically sought, information flows more commonly to strong ties, whose career goals are more likely to be known. Information is more likely to be shared with weak ties if it concerns occupations for which one may be specifically credentialed, since receiving relevant training serves as signal of interest in such jobs. These finding suggest that the homophily of referrals and their inequality-generating effects may vary across occupations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

To resolve this confusion, we need to theorize how specific characteristics of ties are related to the mechanisms that make job search through contacts effective. We have reasons to expect that, while a contact's motivation influences the likelihood that a job seeker receives an offer, her homophily with the job seeker on occupation and other job-relevant attributes influences the quality of the offer. The use of strong ties among university students to find jobs in China provides a unique opportunity to empirically isolate the relationship between contact characteristics and the mechanisms through which contacts benefit the job seeker. I tested my hypotheses with data on both the successful and unsuccessful job searches of 478 graduates of China's flagship universities, who, as first-time job seekers, primarily used strong ties. Survey results are consistent with my hypotheses: job seekers who used strong ties to look for jobs had more offers-but not better offers-than those who used only formal methods.

    "Year": 2012,
    "Abs": "Prestigious members on social networking websites are attracting increasing attentions from peers and corporations. People are used to consulting prestigious members for useful information and corporations are seeking opportunities to leverage them for \"word of mouth\" advertising. Identification and recognition of these prestigious members have been a crucial issue. Besides, the dynamic nature of members' behaviour determines the evolving nature of members' prestige. With the evolution of members' behaviour, currently prestigious members may be substituted by others who are not prestigious at present. The prediction of members' prestige evolution will help discover potential prestigious members, which will then help both people and corporations move to secure their long-term interests. However, little work has been done in relation to prediction of prestigious members. This paper aims to fill this gap specially using Flickr groups as a testbed. By investigating social actions among members, a graph-based action network framework to predict evolution of prestigious members has been proposed. Based on the social structural theory, which points out the interactive effect between social structure and users' actions, a favor action network that captures the social actions of choosing favourite photos of members is constructed. According to the network theory, properties of the nodes in the favor action network are investigated to identify currently prestigious members, and structural properties underlying the favor action network are mined to analyze the communication behaviour of members in a group. Further, the sociological theory inspires four key factors that affect members' favor action intentions, which are homophily, triadic interaction rule, continuity and recency. Based on the above analysis, a hybrid algorithm taking all these four factors into account is proposed to predict members' prestige evolution. Finally, several comprehensive and systematic analyses are designed and conducted to evaluate each of the functional components of the proposed framework. Results of evaluation on a real-world dataset validate its performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "Abs": "Homophily promotes the development of social relationships within social groups and increases segregation across groups. Although prior research has demonstrated that network segregation operates in many dimensions such as race and gender, sexual orientation has received little attention. This study investigates what accounts for the segregation between gay, lesbian and bisexual friends and straight friends in GLB youth's personal networks by testing three possible underlying mechanisms - structural constraints, choice homophily and compartmentalization attempts. The analysis uses data collected from GLB youth who were becoming members of a community organization in Indiana from 1994 through 1998. Although the small, convenience sample does not allow generalization of the results, the rich network data provide important insights into personal network segregation in this unique social context. The results suggest that the segregation between GLB and straight friends result from structural constraints and friends' preference to interact within their groups, and that the focal GLB youth's effort to compartmentalize his or her sexual identity accounts little for the segregation."

Together, three principles of social structure proximity, homophily, and transitivity logically imply that college students assigned a roommate of a given race will have more friends (other than their roommate) of that race than will students assigned a roommate not of that race. A test with data collected from 195 white freshmen at Stanford University in the spring of 2002 supports this prediction. Our analysis advances earlier work by predicting and providing evidence of race-specific effects: While students assigned a different-race roommate of a given race have more friends (other than their roommate) of their roommate's race, they do not have more different-race friends not of their roommate's race.

    "Abs": "The fact that similarity breeds connections, the principle of homophily, has been well-studied in existing sociology literature. Several studies have observed this phenomenon by conducting surveys on human subjects. These studies have concluded that new ties are formed between similar individuals. This phenomenon has been used to explain several socio-psychological concepts such as, segregation, community development, social mobility, etc. However, due to the nature of these studies and limitations because of involvement of human subjects, conclusions from these studies are not easily extensible in online social media. Social media, which is becoming the infinite space for interactions, has exceeded all the expectations in terms of growth, for reasons beyond human mind. New ties are formed in social media in the same way that they emerge in real-world. However, given the differences between real world and online social media, do the same factors that govern the construction of new ties in real world also govern the construction of new ties in social media? In other words, does homophily exist in social media? In this article, we study this extremely significant question. We propose a systematic approach by studying three online social media sites, BlogCatalog, Last.fm, and LiveJournal and report our findings along with some interesting observations. The results indicate that the influence of interest-based homophily is not a very strong leading factor for constructing new ties specifically in the three social media sites with implications to strategic advertising, recommendations, and promoting applications at large."

We propose metrics of overlap fraction, network scale, and O2O transfer amount to quantify the O2O behavior of conference attendees. Our results demonstrate that more than half of the online interactions are included in the offline interaction network, and the offline to online transfer holds the dominant position in this bidirectional O2O transition between online and offline interaction networks.

    "Abs": "Identification of social influence in observational data is a difficult task. Endogeneity issues such as homophily, correlated unobservables and simultaneity raise challenges to the researchers interested in establishing causality and in consistently measuring its magnitude. In this paper we apply randomization techniques to identify social influence in a mobile network setting. Randomization methods consist in generating pseudo-samples of the original data by selectively permuting the values of some variables among observations, and estimating empirical distributions of a parameter of interest under the null hypothesis that such permutations are random. We show that randomization methods are a viable strategy to identify social influence in contexts where all adoption is observed and the date of adoption is available. Furthermore, we show that these methods provide a lower bound for the magnitude of the effect of peer influence. We use a comprehensive panel of data from a large European mobile carrier in one country. The data comprise Call Detailed Records for all the subscribers in this carrier for a period of 11 months. We also have information on pricing plans, adoption of products, promotions and handsets. We estimate the effect of peer influence in six of these promotions. We provide evidence for negative peer influence in their adoption. Peer influence reduces adoption for these promotions between 3% and 9%. Peer influence helps to share information about new promotions but also signals who has already adopted them and, in many cases, such as free calls, having neighbors who adopted the promotion is enough to benefit from it."

However, few studies have explicitly examined sexual identity as a point of homophily. Scholars from multiple disciplines have long argued that sexuality influences the organization of our social worlds, yet most studies of friendship and social networks under-examine or overlook the influence of sexual identity. This study addresses that gap by looking at status homophily among lesbian social ties to examine the influence of sexual identity, as well as gender, race, class, and family, on their personal networks. Using survey data from 544 U.S. lesbian respondents, the findings make visible some of the factors and forces that shape social ties for lesbians. The results point to the importance of sexuality as an organizing element of social life, and suggest that studies that examine social networks or friendships more often make sexual identity, gender, and intersecting social locations a central focus."

We illustrate the generating of posteriors and unobserved tie-variables with empirical network data where 74% of the tie variables are unobserved under the assumption that some standard assumptions hold true. One of these assumptions is that covariates are fixed and completely observed. A likely scenario is that also covariates might only be partially observed and we propose a further extension of the data augmentation algorithm for missing attributes. We provide an illustrative example of parameter inference with nearly 30% of dyads affected by missing attributes (e.g.homophily effects). The assumption that all actors are known is another assumption that is liable to be violated so that there are \"covert actors\". We briefly discuss various aspects of this problem with reference to the Sageman (2004) data set on suspected terrorists. We conclude by identifying some areas in need of further research.

    "Year": 2013,
    "Abs": "Objectives: Previous criminological scholarship has posited that network ties among neighborhood residents may impact crime rates, but has done little to consider the specific ways in which network structure may enhance or inhibit criminal activity. A lack of data on social ties has arguably led to this state of affairs. We propose to avoid this limitation by demonstrating a novel approach of extrapolatively simulating network ties and constructing structural network measures to assess their effect on neighborhood crime rates.Methods: We first spatially locate the households of a city into their constituent blocks. Then, we employ spatial interaction functions based on prior empirical work and simulate a network of social ties among these residents. From this simulated network, we compute network statistics that more appropriately capture the notions of cohesion and information diffusion that underlie theories of networks and crime.Results: We show that these network statistics are robust predictors of the levels of crime in five separate cities (above standard controls) at the very micro geographic level of blocks and block groups.Conclusions: We conclude by considering extensions of the approach that account for homophily in the formation of network ties.

    "Year": 2013,
    "Abs": "Network measures assume a census of a well-bounded population. This level of coverage is rarely achieved in practice, however, and we have only limited information on the robustness of network measures to incomplete coverage. This paper examines the effect of node-level missingness on 4 classes of network measures: centrality, centralization, topology and homophily across a diverse sample of 12 empirical networks. We use a Monte Carlo simulation process to generate data with known levels of missingness and compare the resulting network scores to their known starting values. As with past studies (Borgatti et al., 2006; Kossinets, 2006), we find that measurement bias generally increases with more missing data. The exact rate and nature of this increase, however, varies systematically across network measures. For example, betweenness and Bonacich centralization are quite sensitive to missing data while closeness and in-degree are robust. Similarly, while the tau statistic and distance are difficult to capture with missing data, transitivity shows little bias even with very high levels of missingness. The results are also clearly dependent on the features of the network. Larger, more centralized networks are generally more robust to missing data, but this is especially true for centrality and centralization measures. More cohesive networks are robust to missing data when measuring topological features but not when measuring centralization. Overall, the results suggest that missing data may have quite large or quite small effects on network measurement, depending on the type of network and the question being posed.

    "Abs": "Cooperation requires that individuals are able to identify, and preferentially associate with, others who have compatible preferences and the shared background knowledge needed to solve interpersonal coordination problems. The present study investigates the nature of such similarity within social networks, asking: What do friends have in common? And what is the relationship between similarity and altruism? The results show that similarity declines with frequency of contact; similarity in general is a significant predictor of altruism and emotional closeness; and, specifically, sharing a sense of humor, hobbies and interests, moral beliefs, and being from the same area are the best predictors. These results shed light on the structure of relationships within networks and provide a possible checklist for predicting attitudes toward strangers, and in-group identification."

    "Year": 2013,
    "Abs": "Alcohol use, is pervasive in adolescence. Though most research is concerned with how friends influence drinking, alcohol is also important for connecting teens to one another. Prior studies have not distinguished between new friendship creation, and existing friendship durability, however. We argue that accounting for distinctions in creation-durability processes is critical for understanding the selection mechanisms drawing drinkers into homophilous friendships, and the social integration that results. In order to address these issues, we applied stochastic actor based models of network dynamics to National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data. Adolescents only modestly prefer new friendships with others who drinker similarly, but greatly prefer friends who indirectly connect them to homophilous drinkers. These indirect homophilous drinker relationships are shorter lived, however, and suggest that drinking is a social focus that connects adolescents via proximity, rather than assortativity. These findings suggest that drinking leads to more situational and superficial social integration. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

    "Year": 2013,
    "Abs": "The tendency to transact within, rather than across, identity-based groups is a well-established effect of identity divisions. While previous work emphasized macrolevel, impersonal factors that counteract this tendency, this article looks at how individuals may counteract it in everyday interaction. Two microlevel counterbalances to economic homophily are examined with unique data on partnerships among Tory and Whig merchants in 18th-century Bristol, England. No conclusive support is found for the first examined counterbalance, which presumes that cross-group social relations, such as joint civic activities, induce parallel economic relations. Instead, the analysis shows that Tory-Whig partnerships were facilitated by the practice of choosing cross-party partners of unequal professional prominence. Such professionally unequal relations involve tacit status subordination, which reduces the relation-specific uncertainty associated with transacting across a salient identity division. The results highlight the potential of uncertainty avoidance to sustain inequality between social groups and suggest unexplored contingencies to theories of status homophily."

    "Year": 2013,
    "Abs": "Interethnic and intergroup social ties are critical to knitting together increasingly diverse societies into cohesive wholes. Yet their formation faces the homophily hurdle: important and intimate social ties tend to be established disproportionately between those sharing significant social attributes. In the spirit of analytical sociology, the author explores two mechanisms that could drive intra- and intergroup relations: attraction to similar versus repulsion from dissimilar others. The models differ in predictions as illustrated by data on interethnic marriages in Great Britain and the United States, on U.S. dating and cohabitation relations by religion and education, on educational diversity in marriages in 22 European countries, and on marriages of the native and foreign-born in Austria. A unified model for the two mechanisms, in which tie formation is a conceptualized as a two-stage process of encounter and consummation, is proposed, and its empirical and theoretical analysis provides deeper understanding of the homophily hurdle."

    "Year": 2013,
    "Abs": "This article is concerned primarily with university students' motivations for voluntarily seeking out intercultural contact on campus. It is based on a larger qualitative research project conducted in an Irish university. This project used a grounded theory approach to explore intercultural relations among students specifically from the perspective of the host culture student cohort. The findings indicate that host students' decision to engage in intercultural contact is based primarily on a perceived utility associated with such contact, which is based on an informal cost-benefit analysis. Other, less prevalent motivational drivers, such as concern for others and the idea of having a shared future are also identified. Although the study focuses on a higher education environment, many of the ideas and theories discussed and questions raised may be applied to broader intercultural environments. In particular the article aims to highlight the current gap in literature relating to motivations for engaging in intercultural contact and also seeks to highlight the potential value of social exchange theory (Thibaut & Kelley, 1959) to understanding the dynamics of intercultural contact. It also emphasises the relevance of the concept of `homophily' (Lazarsfeld & Merton, 1954) to the field of intercultural studies. As such, the article seeks to combine empirical data with extant theory in order to gain a deeper understanding into the dynamics of intercultural contact. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Women respond only to men of similar or more dominant racial status, while nonblack men respond to all but black women.

We compare associations between individual use and peer use of tobacco and alcohol when network boundary (e.g., classroom, entire grade in school, and community) and relational type (elicited by asking whom students: (a) are friends with, (b) admire, (c) think will succeed, (d) would like to have a romantic relationship with, and (e) think are popular) are varied. Additionally, we estimate Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) for 232 networks to obtain a homophily estimate for smoking and drinking. Data were collected from a cross-sectional sample of 1707 adolescents in five high schools in one school district in Los Angeles, CA. Results of logistic regression models show that associations were strongest when the boundary condition was least constrained and that associations were stronger for friendship networks than for other ones. Additionally, ERGM estimations show that grade-level friendship networks returned significant homophily effects more frequently than the classroom networks. This study validates existing theoretical approaches to the network study of social influence as well as ways to estimate them. We recommend researchers use as broad a boundary as possible when collecting network data, but observe that for some research purposes more narrow boundaries may be preferred. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

    "Abs": "Stochastic actor-based approaches receive increasing interest in the generation of social networks for simulation in time and space. Existing models however cannot be readily integrated in agent-based models that assume random-utility-maximizing behavior of agents. We propose an agent-based model to generate social networks explicitly in geographic space which is formulated in the random-utility-maximizing (RUM) framework. The proposed model consists of a friendship formation mechanism and a component to simulate social encounters in a population. We show how transitivity can be incorporated in both components and how the model can be estimated based on data of personal networks using likelihood estimation. In an application to the Swiss context, we demonstrate the estimation and ability of the model to reproduce relevant characteristics of networks, such as geographic proximity, attribute similarity (homophily), size of personal networks (degree distribution) and clustering (transitivity). We conclude that the proposed social-network model fits seamlessly in existing large-scale micro-simulation systems which assume RUM behavior of agents. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Using an online survey of 661 travel consumers, this study applies the component-based structural equation modeling technique of partial least squares to examine online travelers' perceptions of the credibility of UGC sources and how these perceptions influence attitudes and intentions toward UGC utilization in the travel planning process. The model also draws on the theory of homophily to make predictions about the antecedent of credibility. Results validate the Source Credibility Theory in the context of UGC but also accentuate the central mediating role of attitude. In addition, the study finds support for perceptual homophily as a critical determinant of both credibility and attitude. Theoretical and managerial implications are highlighted."

We propose a simple and efficient but empirically based approach for spatial agent-based models which explicitly takes into account restrictions and opportunities imposed by effects of baseline homophily, i.e.the influence of local socio-demography on the composition of one's social network. Furthermore, the algorithm considers the probability of links that depends on geographical distance between potential partners.The resulting network reflects social settings and furthermore allows the modeller to influence network properties by adjusting agent type specific parameters. Especially the parameter for distance dependence and the probability of distant links allow for control of clustering and agent type distribution of personal networks."

The model posits that activities of a set of actors, represented in the two-mode network, co-evolve with exchanges and interactions between the actors, as represented in the one-mode network. The model assumes that the actors, not the activities, have agency.The empirical value of the model is demonstrated by examining how employment preferences co-evolve with friendship and advice relations in a group of seventy-five MBA students. The analysis shows that activity in the two-mode network, as expressed by number of employment preferences, is related to activity in the friendship network, as expressed by outdegrees. Further, advice ties between students lead to agreement with respect to employment preferences. In addition, considering the multiplexity of advice and friendship ties yields a better understanding of the dynamics of the advice relation: tendencies to reciprocation and homophily in advice relations are mediated to an important extent by friendship relations.The discussion pays attention to the implications of this study in the broader context of current efforts to model the co-evolutionary dynamics of social networks and individual behavior.

    "Year": 2013,
    "Abs": "Existing sociological theories of international relations yield contrasting predictions for their structure that range from an increasingly dense and universally tied network to networks in which ties tend to concentrate within or between certain types of economically, politically or culturally defined blocs. We contribute to this growing body of empirical research by analyzing original data on the complete worldwide network of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) as it has evolved over the course of 50 years since its inception in 1959. We find that the number of BITs increases almost exponentially over time to include nearly all of the world's countries. However, the density of ties between advanced capitalist and others is stronger than for any other dyadic types. We also find patterns of regional homophily, but only in Asia, East Asia, Postsocialist Europe and Eurasia, and North Africa/Middle East. These findings suggest that existing explanations of globalization are more complementary than contending. Theorizing about any particular global outcome thus requires attention to the simultaneity of material and cultural forces and the interplay of transnational and local socio-historical developments. Our analysis of the structure of the BIT network also helps explain the weak link between foreign direct investment and BITs discovered in previous research."

    "Abs": "This article examines the interplay of homophily (similarity breeds connection) at two levels in international tradedyadic similarity (geographic, political, and cultural proximity) and systemic similarity (structural equivalence and world-system status). First, there is a substitution effect between dyadic homophily and systemic homophily from structural equivalence. Both types of homophily generate favorable social structure that facilitates international trade. The existence of structural equivalence lessens the dependence of bilateral trade on dyadic homophily. Second, there is a stratification effect of world-system status on dyadic homophily. Geographic homophily matters the most for bilateral trade between two noncore countries, while political and cultural homophily is the most influential for trade between a core country and a noncore country. These two findings have important implications. The substitution effect of structural equivalence prevents international trade from complete fragmentation along geographic, political, and cultural lines, while the stratification effect of world-system status reveals unequal capacity across countries to overcome the structural constraints imposed by dyadic homophily."

Although U.S. neighborhoods are becoming increasingly heterogeneous in composition, little is known about black households' participation in social and informational networks within multiracial middle-class neighborhoods. Drawing on theories of the gift and social capital, we view neighborhoods in terms of complex patterns of inter-household exchanges of material and symbolic goods. We predict that black-led households will exchange at a lower rate with their neighbors than will other households and test this prediction using survey data collected from 119 households and from follow-up interviews with eight black heads of household. Our main finding from the survey is that black households exchanged at a significantly lower rate than did other households, ceteris paribus. The follow-up interviews found little evidence of black racial homophily in neighboring or of racism within the neighborhood. However, the low rate of black inter-household exchanges may be partly explained by black head of households' personal experiences of racism outside the neighborhood and by a racially constituted disposition against borrowing from neighbors. We discuss implications of our findings for research on racial integration and segregation."

Design Egocentric social network analysis was used to characterize formally the relationships between social network characteristics and gambling pathology. Setting Laboratory-based questionnaire and interview administration. Participants Forty frequent gamblers (22 non-pathological gamblers, 18 pathological gamblers) were recruited from the community. Measurements and Findings The SNA revealed significant social network compositional differences between the two groups: pathological gamblers (PGs) had more gamblers, smokers and drinkers in their social networks than did non-pathological gamblers (NPGs). PGs had more individuals in their network with whom they personally gambled, smoked and drank than those with who were NPG. Network ties were closer to individuals in their networks who gambled, smoked and drank more frequently. Associations between gambling severity and structural network characteristics were not significant. Conclusions Pathological gambling is associated with compositional but not structural differences in social networks. Pathological gamblers differ from non-pathological gamblers in the number of gamblers, smokers and drinkers in their social networks. Homophily within the networks also indicates that gamblers tend to be closer with other gamblers. This homophily may serve to reinforce addictive behaviors, and may suggest avenues for future study or intervention."

    "Abs": "Formal theories of collective action face the problem that in large groups a single actor makes such a small impact on the collective good that cooperation is irrational. Critical mass theorists argue that this 'large group problem' can be solved by an initial critical mass of contributors, whose efforts can produce a 'bandwagon' effect, making cooperation rational for the remaining members of the population. However, critical mass theory requires an explanation of how a critical mass can form in the first place. I present a model of collective action that solves this problem by showing how aspects of social structure - including network topology, homophily, and local coalition formation - can allow rational actors to endogenously form a critical mass. The findings indicate that as the mobilization effort becomes more 'complex', clustered networks and homophily become increasingly important for critical mass collective action."

We explicate a four-step procedure that discovers interaction effects based on clusters of cases in the data matrix, hence aiding in inductive model specification. We illustrate with two examples. One is a reanalysis of data from a published study of the effect of social welfare policy extensiveness on poverty rates across 15 countries. The second uses General Social Survey data to predict four different dimensions of ego-network homophily.

Previous research by Robert Putnam suggests that individuals in compositionally diverse geographical areas become closed off from their social ties and less trusting of others, which are both antithetical to social support exchange. We argue, however, that studies of compositional diversity are ill-suited to reflect diversity as it is actually lived and experienced in social life. Drawing from the first nationally representative study with comprehensive indicators of interactional diversity in social life, we analyze self-reports of advice-giving across a variety of social roles. Results of regression analysis are consistent: greater interactional diversity is positively associated with advice-giving, whether the target is stranger, neighbor, close friend, or family member. These findings hold independent of important covariates such as reciprocity, sociability, and homophily. This research contributes to a growing literature set on identifying the unanticipated benefits of diversity in modern society. In sum, we call future research to consider not only diversity in structure, but also diversity in action. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

    "Abs": "Choice mechanisms and social networks, including \"marriage markets\", seem well-suited to be modelled using agent-type simulations. Few real-world empirical examples are available in the public literature, particularly those using human populations of size. We reviewed partnership models in both the micro-simulation and agent-based literatures. We then empirically implemented an algorithm derived from two established models using inter-censal data on first partnerships in New Zealand over the period 1981-2006. The purpose of the exercise was to test the robustness of different parameter settings and to determine whether a model simulating partnership selection among eligible never-married young adults at one census period is feasible for predicting patterns of partnership, co-habitation and marriage at the next. Varying simulation time and social network size parameters of the model showed that patterns of ethnic partnering could be consistently produced and were not dependent on these model settings. Examining the different scoring methods showed that age similarity, education similarity, and previous partnering patterns could produce partnership patterns similar to those seen in the census. The simulation produced patterns of ethnic partnering similar to those seen in the census and seemed robust to different parameter settings. To further improve these results, an optimised combination of the scoring components is proposed. The simulations also provided preliminary evidence of ethnic preferences in the New Zealand marriage market."

Based on the survey data the author collected in 2005, this paper suggests another main mechanism state policies in explaining the ethnic variations. State policies have led to in-group association and ethnic inequalities, which have limited Uyghur access to high-status individuals.

Some are rank-ordered caste systems and others are flat, cliquish worlds. Explaining the source of such structural variation remains a challenge, however, because global network features are generally treated as the agglomeration of micro-level tie-formation mechanisms, namely balance, homophily, and dominance. How do the same micro-mechanisms generate significant variation in global network structures? To answer this question we propose and test a network ecological theory that specifies the ways features of organizational environments moderate the expression of tie-formation processes, thereby generating variability in global network structures across settings. We develop this argument using longitudinal friendship data on schools (Add Health study) and classrooms (Classroom Engagement study), and by extending exponential random graph models to the study of multiple societies over time."

    "Title": "Identity-based learning and segregation in social networks under different institutional environments",
    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "To study the evolution of segregation in social networks across systems embedded in different institutional environments, we develop an identity-based learning model where segregation is stochastically conditioned by the initial distribution of the actor's attention to identity and the updating of this distribution over time. The updating process, which we call the process of mutual learning multiplier, is based on an actor's success and failure experiences in tying with the same-subgroup and cross-subgroup actors. Results from a Monte Carlo simulation of the model show that the mutual learning multiplier produces disproportional relationships between the initial distribution of identity attention and the level of segregation in social networks. We also find that those relationships are affected by the actors' attention to structural holes, rate of learning from experience, system size, and the identity heterogeneity of the system. Overall, the model provides insights into various dynamics of network structuration across time and space."

This research examined the dynamic processes of relationship formation, maintenance, and demise in a massively multiplayer online game. Drawing from evolutionary and ecological theories of social networks, this study focuses on the impact of three sets of evolutionary factors in the context of social relationships in the online game EverQuest II (EQII): the aging and maturation processes, social architecture of the game, and homophily and proximity. A longitudinal analysis of tie persistence and decay demonstrated the transient nature of social relationships in EQII, but ties became considerably more durable over time. Also, character level similarity, shared guild membership, and geographic proximity were powerful mechanisms in preserving social relationships."

    "Title": "Measuring segregation in social networks",
    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "Network homophily is a pattern in which ties are more likely to exist between nodes similar to each other. It is frequently observed for various types of social relations. At the same time, segregation is often encountered in urban areas as a tendency of families to occupy neighborhoods inhabited by other families similar to them. In this paper we conceptualize both phenomena as in the language of networks of interlinked positions occupied by a population of actors characterized by some node-level attribute. We review existing indexes and approaches to measuring the extent of homophily/segregation in social networks. We pursue an approach of, first, specifying a set of properties that a generic segregation measure might possess, and which, in our view, are relevant in substantial contexts. Second, we check which measures satisfy which properties. The use of measures is illustrated with four empirical examples. Given the particular application and the need for some descriptive measure of segregation, the results presented in this paper can help in selecting an optimal measure for the task at hand. We conclude that the most crucial aspects for the choice of a particular segregation measure include (1) whether the network ties or actors' attributes are assumed to be subject to change, and (2) how one should treat the presence of network isolates.

Results confirmed the hypothesized positive association between the number of network members (friends, acquaintances, siblings) with young children and the respondents' transition rate into parenthood, particularly among younger couples. Several potential intervening mechanisms underlying this social contagion effect were tested. First, evidence was found for observational learning processes in which Ego obtained information on the joys and challenges of parenthood from network members with children. Second, childless respondents tended to feel pressured from couples with children in the network to start a family. Third, results supported the notion of social opportunity costs in that the anticipated loss of social ties after becoming a parent was more likely the fewer parents there were in the network. All three mechanisms exerted a positive impact on both fertility intentions and behavior. Panel regression models relying on intraindividtal change scores showed that social learning was the most robust mechanism. An additional indirect test for causality suggested that the findings were unlikely to merely reflect parental status homophily (i.e., selection effects). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

    "Abs": "Despite the influence of social support on physical and mental health, few studies have examined why some close ties are more supportive than others. Though religion provides a rich context for social interaction and a meaningful social identity, it has received little attention in the social support literature. A growing literature on religion and health offers insight into how religion affects social support processes. Using dyadic network data derived from the nationally representative 2006 Portraits of American Life Study, I examine how the religious dimensions of close, nonhousehold ties relate to provision of social support. Results from logistic regression analyses indicate that (controlling for a range of other social tie characteristics) same-faith ties are significantly more likely to be sources of help in times of need, while religious discussion is a strong predictor of receiving both help and advice. The effect of religious homophily is strongest for evangelical Protestants and African-American Protestants. My findings underscore the need for social support researchers to consider the role of religion in shaping support processes in close relationships."

We propose a multidimensional model that employs both qualitative and quantitative methods for examining homophily behaviors by looking at three dimensions: blog-to-blog, blog-tovideo, blog post-to-video. Findings show that while homophily patterns prevail, some limited occurrences of cross-ideological practices exist. The cross-linking practices may include deliberative motives, but in essence they are not created for the purposes of discourse. Instead, these cross-linking practices strengthen previously held political stances of the users who create them and negatively portray and reframe content of alternative views. This represents homophily in the guise of cross-linking."

First it uses the classical definition of homophily (in this article called elementary homophily) to compare mutual ties between groups defined by employment status, age and city of residence. These analyses are then enriched by incorporating the level of affective proximity, thus forming what we have called specific homophily. The analysis of elementary homophily confirms the expected predominance of homophilous relationships over heterophilous ones. The analysis of specific homophily shows that inter-group relationships between close and intimate contacts follow similar patterns, whereas these differ substantially for relationships that are not at all close. The comparison of the two types of homophily shows a correspondence between high values in elementary homophily and high values in close and intimate relationships."

These areas have been transformed by the process of new-build gentrification that regularly contributes to enlarging the historic western axis of Paris' upper-class neighborhoods. The paper analyzes successively the causes and motivations of the inhabitants' residential choices, the weak local sociability associated with this specific type of urban self-segregation, and the key role played by the drawing of socioeconomic symbolic boundaries among the upper middle classes. Indeed, homophilic aggregation in the refounded neighborhoods follows a logic largely different and autonomous from the (complementary) one based on radical alterization and stigmatization that motivates the avoidance of the working class."

We observe considerable homophily within families and neighborhoods, but also extensive circulation of credit among the most commercially and politically active Florentines. The overall connectivity of this network of interpersonal credit transactions resembles the social structure of other contemporaneous Florentine networks, such as marriage and business, suggesting that interpersonal credit was an important and distinct domain in which elite membership was confirmed and elite social solidarity achieved."

    "Abs": "Homophily - the tendency for individuals to associate with similar others - is one of the most persistent findings in social network analysis. Its importance is established along the lines of a multitude of sociologically relevant dimensions, e.g. sex, ethnicity and social class. Existing research, however, mostly focuses on one dimension at a time. But people are inherently multidimensional, have many attributes and are members of multiple groups. In this article, we explore such multidimensionality further in the context of network dynamics. Are friendship ties increasingly likely to emerge and persist when individuals have an increasing number of attributes in common? We analyze eleven friendship networks of adolescents, draw on stochastic actor-oriented network models and focus on the interaction of established homophily effects. Our results indicate that main effects for homophily on various dimensions are positive. At the same time, the interaction of these homophily effects is negative. There seems to be a diminishing effect for having more than one attribute in common. We conclude that studies of homophily and friendship formation need to address such multidimensionality further."

    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "Adolescents tend to adopt behaviors that are similar to those of their friends, and also tend to become friends with peers that have similar interests and behaviors. This tendency towards homogeneity applies not only to conventional behaviors such as working for school and participating in sports activities, but also to risk behaviors such as drug use, oppositional behavior or unsafe sex. The current study aims at building an agent model to answer the following related questions: How do friendship groups evolve and what is the role of behavioral similarity in friendship formation? How does homogeneity among peers emerge, with regard to conventional as well as risk behaviors? On the basis of the theoretical and empirical literature on friendship selection and influences on risk behavior during adolescence we first developed a conceptual framework, which was then translated into a mathematical model of a dynamic system and implemented as an agent-based computer simulation consisting of simple behavioral rules and principles. Each agent in the model holds distinct property matrices including an individual behavioral profile with a list of risky (i.e., alcohol use, aggressiveness, soft drugs) and conventional behaviors (i.e., school attendance, sports, work). The computer model simulates the development, during one school year, of a social network (i.e.formation of friendships and cliques), the (dyadic) interactions between pupils and their behavioral profiles. During the course of simulation, the agents' behavioral profiles change on the basis of their interactions resulting in individual developmental curves of conventional and risk behaviors. These profiles are used to calculate the (behavioral) similarity and differences between the various agents. Generally, the model output is analyzed by means of visual inspection (i.e., plotting developmental curves of behavior and social networks), systematic comparison and by calculating additional measures (i.e., using specific social analysis software packages). Simulation results conclusively indicate model validity. The model simulates qualitative properties currently found in research on adolescent development, namely the role of homophily, the appearance of friendship clusters, and the increase in behavioral homogeneity among friends. The model not only converges with empirical findings, but furthermore helps to explain social psychological phenomena (e.g. the emergence of homophily among adolescents)."

    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "Peter Blau was one of the first to define a latent social space and utilize it to provide concrete hypotheses. Blau defines social structure via social \"parameters\" (constraints). Actors that are closer together (more homogenous) in this social parameter space are more likely to interact. One of Blau's most important hypotheses resulting from this work was that the consolidation of parameters could lead to isolated social groups. For example, the consolidation of race and income might lead to segregation. In the present work, we use Foursquare data from New York City to explore evidence of homogeneity along certain social parameters and consolidation that breeds social isolation in communities of locations checked in to by similar users.More specifically, we first test the extent to which communities detected via Latent Dirichlet Allocation are homogenous across a set of four social constraints-racial homophily, income homophily, personal interest homophily and physical space. Using a bootstrapping approach, we find that 14 (of 20) communities are statistically, and all but one qualitatively, homogenous along one of these social constraints, showing the relevance of Blau's latent space model in venue communities determined via user check-in behavior. We then consider the extent to which communities with consolidated parameters, those homogenous on more than one parameter, represent socially isolated populations. We find communities homogenous on multiple parameters, including a homosexual community and a \"hipster\" community, that show support for Blau's hypothesis that consolidation breeds social isolation. We consider these results in the context of mediated communication, in particular in the context of self-representation on social media."

In this article, we examine changes over a 20-year period in two types of homophily-the actual level of contact between people in different social categories and the level of contact relative to chance. We use data from the 1985 and 2004 General Social Surveys to ask whether the strengths of five social distinctions-sex, race/ethnicity, religious affiliation, age, and education-changed over the past two decades in core discussion networks. Changes in the actual level of homophily are driven by the demographic composition of the United States. As the nation has become more diverse, cross-category contacts in race/ethnicity and religion have increased. After describing the raw homophily rates, we develop a case-control model to assess homophily relative to chance mixing. We find decreasing rates of homophily for gender but stability for race and age, although the young are increasingly isolated from older cohorts outside of the family. We also find some weak evidence for increasing educational and religious homophily. These relational trends may be explained by changes in demographic heterogeneity, institutional segregation, economic inequality, and symbolic boundaries."

    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of homophily on diffusion over social networks. An agent-based simulation model is developed to serve as the experimental ground for this analysis. Diffusion dynamics of a nonsticky innovation is investigated by varying homophily levels in the social network depicted in the model as the primary control variable. First of all, the results show that homophily is self-reinforcing. Second, starting from a nonhomophilous network, early increases in the level of homophily have a positive effect on the extent of diffusion, whereas further increases have a negative impact. Finally, several local minima and maxima are observed in the relation between the homophily level and the extent of diffusion. Our analysis focuses on node properties such as connectedness and average degrees in order to explain the observed regular relationship between homophily and diffusion. We argue that (i) homophily increases the connectedness of different status groups separately and (ii) increasing levels of homophily decreases the marginal importance of a single homophilous tie by increasing the sources of valuable information. Future research involves investigating the coevolution of social behavior and networks by allowing the adopted innovation to lead to value homophily, exploration of different diffusion initiation types, and different adoption heuristics."

We find that having a provider of the same race is very important for African Americans and Hispanics, while having a provider with similar religious beliefs is extremely important for evangelical Protestants. Other predictive variables for homophilous preferences in race and religion are age, mobility, and education.ConclusionsProfessional skills corresponding to organizational position are important to most people, but specific demographic groups prioritize racial, ethnic, and religious homophily.

In this article, we extend the SAN framework with several leading supervised and unsupervised link-prediction algorithms and demonstrate performance improvement for each algorithm on both link prediction and attribute inference. Moreover, we make the novel observation that attribute inference can help inform link prediction, that is, link-prediction accuracy is further improved by first inferring missing attributes.

Researchers were identified using a \"snowball\" technique. The publications search was conducted using national and international databases. The density and average geodesic distance of networks were calculated, as was the size, pairs, brokers and homophily of egocentric networks.Results: There were 531 researchers. Most worked in epidemiology (77.59%), and in more than one thematic field. The network density was 0.0058 and the average geodesic distance was 4.418. Several indicators suggested that the most cohesive egocentric networks were those in which researches investigated more than in one knowledge area or in epidemiology. Homophily was lower for health systems, biostatistics and social and behavioral sciences, as well as private hospitals and the public university.Conclusions: The network structure suggests a growth phase in research and a predominance of epidemiology.

Interview data from 87 undergraduates at an urban commuter university demonstrate the distinction between \"adopting\" and \"enacting\" sexual scripts. Although the majority of students locate hooking up as a salient cultural scenario for their lives, the adoption of hooking up does not neatly translate into its enactment for all students. Where students live emerges as a fault line systematically structuring opportunities for hooking up. There are racial and class divisions even among students with similar residential locations, reflecting the importance of socioeconomic resources and peer group homophily to sexuality. This study points to how race, class, and residence integrally shape the interpersonal sexual scripts of college students."

    "Abs": "Individuals who engage in deviant behaviors are more likely to be friends with other deviants compared to non-deviants. This pattern has been observed across different types of deviant activities and among different age groups. In question, however, is the mechanism that underlies this pattern. In this article we develop and test a new theory to explain homophily among deviants. Deviance makes one vulnerable to the risk of being caught and sanctioned. This vulnerability imposes a stringent constraint on deviants' choice of friends. Following Thomas Schelling, we conjecture that a way to establish trust consists of making oneself blackmailable by disclosing compromising information on one's misdeeds, or sharing compromising secrets (SCS). If two individuals share their illicit behaviors with one another, both are made vulnerable and a friendship can be established. We propose a series of hypotheses derived from SCS comparing levels of homophily in deviant and non-deviant behaviors. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health we estimate adolescents' preferences for deviant and non-deviant friends, within and across types of activities, and across different social contexts. Together, these tests allow us to distinguish between the theory we develop, SCS, and alternatives."

While past research argues that homophily is beneficial to job mobility, we find differential effects based on the race. OLS and OLR regression analyses on the quality of one's first head coaching job in NCAA men's basketball indicate that black assistant coaches working under black head coaches (black homophily) are significantly disadvantaged compared to all other racial combinations: white assistants with white supervisors (white homophily), white assistants with black supervisors (white heterophily), and black assistants with white supervisors (black heterophily). In contrast, there is no significant difference in job quality among the latter three groups: white homophily, white heterophily, and black heterophily. This indicates that while homophily is neither advantageous nor disadvantageous for whites, it is disadvantageous for black job candidates. This racially based disadvantage makes it difficult for minority job candidates to break through the glass ceiling and has real-world financial implications."

As an attempt to illuminate the positive aspect of anonymity, this study examines the effects of social anonymity on individuals' perception of and their trust to the community, and how such effects are formed through the mediation of empathy and perceived homophily. First, social anonymity was found to have a positive influence on perceived homophily, which in turn influenced the feeling of empathy, Second, the feeling of empathy and perceived homophily did influence respectively individuals' trust to and sense of the community, Also, social anonymity was found to have a significant effect directly on the trust level of the community.

    "Title": "Identity Multipliers and the Mistaken Twittering of 'Birds of a Feather'",
    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "New Media usage has expanded in unexpected directions. This qualitative study pulls together two new media phenomena that demonstrate widespread engineered influence through Twitter dispersion. The first aspect is the practice of sock-puppetry deception that occurs when social media identities are used without proof of identity. The relative ease in creating a single invented online identity is overshadowed by the more recent practise of harnessing thousands of created identities to accentuate the standing of a single identity. The second aspect is the use of metadata to fetch and find increased nodes of commonality. This promulgates the perception of connectivity and homogeneity in terms of information transfer. Identity masking in Twitter, and the use of homophily to manipulate authority, public sway, and social media deception are a formidable combination. This study considers the increasing use of sock-puppetry in conjunction with techniques that exploit homophily to sway the perceptions of others. The ethical and socio-political issues of identity deception and their subsequent impact are discussed. Using the publicly available Twitter accounts of six high profile political figures, the study compares retweets that retain metadata from original tweets. Using both real and fake accounts, the paper tests the hypothesis that non-genuine Sybil Twitter accounts are deployed in the followings of popular figures by using metadata in retweets to establish credibility amongst fake entities. New Media experiences augmented manipulation in multiple ways. The use of metatagging to expose greater commonality increases both the frequency and the amplitude of information diffusion when delivered through social networking and microblogging. A comparison of the associated tweets, followers, and retweets of high profile leaders indicate pervasive sock-puppetry and Sybil deception. With homophily embedded into Tweets and Retweets, sock puppetry in social media presents a challenge. Where homophily fits traditional notions of \"similarity between two nodes\", increasing the likelihood of likeness to occur is problematic. If homophily and false identity coalesce, then the use of twitter as a reliable social medium is contingent on discrete user identity in social media."

    "Abs": "Gender differences in human social and communication behavior have long been observed in various contexts. This study investigates such differences in the case of online social networking. We find a general tendency towards gender homophily, more marked for women, however users having a large circle of friends tend to have more connections with users of the opposite gender. We also inspect the temporal sequences of adding new friends and find that females are much more likely to connect with other females as their initial friends. Through studying triangle motifs broken down by gender we detect a marked tendency of users to gender segregation, i.e.to form single gender groups; this phenomenon is more accentuated for male users."

    "Abs": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a network analysis of Twitter discussions about Myung-Bak Lee, a former president of South Korea, to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of the public opinion exchange on Twitter.Design/methodology/approach - Opinion leaders in the discussion network were identified by considering the longitudinal distribution of tweets containing the former president's name, and three types of messages (\"followings,\" \"mentions,\" and \"retweets\") were analyzed using data collected from November 1, 2011, to April 20, 2012. The sample included 26,150 Twitter users and 892,034 relationships reflecting three types of messages.Findings - The results indicate that the discussion about President Myung-Bak Lee was dominated by liberal Twitter users who already had considerable influence both online and offline. In addition, Twitter users were unlikely to interact with other users with opposing political views.Research limitations/implications - Almost all of the opinion leaders identified in the study held liberal political views, and liberal Twitter users dominated the discussion network. In addition, the Korean Twitter network showed the presence of the homophily phenomenon, implying that opinion leaders' influence within the Twitter network was limited to other users sharing the same political views. Further, political views of opinion leaders were skewed toward a particular political stance without necessarily representing the opinion of the general public, possibly hindering the democratic process.Originality/value - This study tests the homophily thesis in the context of Twitter users in Korea and contributes to the literature on Twitter-based political discourse by identifying opinion leaders in Korean Twitter networks and examining the phenomenon of homophily within those networks."

From the theoretical underpinnings of interest-based homophily, action theory, and social movement theory, we propose a conceptual framework and analytics to consider the question \"how can organizations motivate strategic directed action from participants within social media to accomplish organizational goals?\" We discuss the theories of interest-based homophilies to identify and explain how organizations can develop information-based analytics appropriate to motivate strategic action in social media using similar approaches to those utilized by social movement and social movement framing. There has been little theorizing on the nature and structuration of social media from which appropriate directed action can be strategically conceptualized. This paper presents novel theoretical foundations from which to understand social media and develop effective strategies to advance organizational interests."

    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "Tie formation in social networks is driven by different motives that are not always apparent in the social network itself. These motives differ from one social network to another, depending on, e.g., the network's purpose, such as advice seeking or collaboration, and the effort it costs to establish a friendship relationship. A common factor that exists in almost all social networks is homophily: the tendency of social network members to connect to similar members. In this work, we look at the tie formation process in social networks from a different perspective where we consider not only a social network SN, but also a set of associated interaction networks G(n) around it. We show, based on 6 social networks and in total 20 different associated interaction networks, that it is possible to predict the entire social network's structure to a satisfactory extent, only by knowing the structure of these interaction networks. As social networks are based on a voluntary relationship while some of the interaction relationships are at most semi-controllable for most members, e.g., being together in a team, this seems to indicate that whom we choose as a friend is also determined by whom we interact with."

    "Year": 2014,
    "Abs": "Reacting to social issues or events through Online Social Networks has become a social habit. Social scientists have identified several network relationships and dimensions that induce homophily. Sentiments or opinions towards different issues have been observed as a key dimension which characterizes human behaviour. People usually express their sentiments towards various issues. Different persons from different walks of social life may share same opinion towards various issues. When these persons constitute a group, such groups can be conveniently termed same wavelength groups. We propose a novel framework based on sentiments and an algorithm to identify such same wavelength groups from online social networks like twitter. The proposed algorithm generates same wavelength groups in polynomial time for relatively small set of events. The analysis of such groups would be of help in unravelling their response patterns and behavioural features."

This study relies on a large dataset, containing 479, 048 users and 5, 263, 351 user-generated interests, captured from Facebook. We identify the social features from three types of the users' information - demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location), social relations (i.e., friendship), and users' interests. The results reveal that the interest similarity follows the homophily principle. Particularly, the results show that two users are more likely to be alike in their interests 1) if they exhibit more similarity in their demographic characteristics (e.g., similar age, same gender, or close to each other geographically), or 2) if they are more intimate in their friendship, or 3) if they present a higher average interest individuality (i.e., a measurement for estimating the personalized characteristics of a user's interests). The empirical observations could be exploited to infer how two users are alike in their interests according to the social features, which could be further harnessed by various practical applications and services, such as recommendation system and advertisement service."

Questionnaire data are used to examine whether female physicians are socially integrated in the male-dominated profession of medicine in terms of the support they receive from their medical colleagues compared to male physicians. The literature on tokenism and homophily suggests that women in male-dominated professions receive less support than their male colleagues, whereas the social support literature predicts that women typically receive more emotional support than men but less informational and instrumental support. The results of this study shed light on the complex and multi-layered ways in which gender is relevant to our understanding of the extent to which co-workers provide empathy, information and assistance to one another."

    "Abs": "The number of individuals claiming a nonreligious identity in the United States is on the rise, with one-fourth of the overall U.S. public failing to identify with any of the major religious traditions. In this article, we examine whether religious disaffiliation structures social network formation in a social context in which religious identification (and religiosity) is a salient cultural marker. We take advantage of unique data on the personal networks of youth transitioning into a college where religion is a culturally salient facet of everyday life. We hypothesize that, if there is nonreligious homophily, it may result from an attraction of the disaffiliated to each other or from a repulsion away from the religiously affiliated. Results of exponential random graph models suggest that both mechanisms may be at play. We find that religious Nones and affiliated non-Catholics are disproportionately more likely to form and maintain relationships with one another and are relatively less likely to form and maintain relationships with members of their respective religious out-groups. We close by outlining the implications of our findings and delineating promising avenues for future research."

The aim of this study is to examine empirically the link between online/offline using the example of social online gaming. The data consist of individual and group interviews with 33 adult garners. The results explore three themes sociability and design; group membership; norms and rules and show how on-and offline are inexorably linked through the social organizational demands of Internet gaming. Individuals ground online group membership in offline relations and shared characteristics, aiming to maximize game-play gains and support sociability. Gaming with 'people like us' facilitates creation of norms and expectations, which aids in producing stable social groups. Thus the boundary between online and offline becomes contingent on links between people. The study shows how important offline connections are for online interaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about the social networks of same-sex couples, in particular their connections to other same-sex couples, which is important to understand given that the presence of similar others in social networks can ameliorate social stress for stigmatized populations. In this brief report, we present data from a diverse sample of 120 same-sex couples in Atlanta and San Francisco. The median number of other same-sex couples known was 12; couples where one partner was non-Hispanic White and the other a person of color knew relatively few other same-sex couples; and there was a high degree of homophily within the social networks of same-sex couples. These data establish a useful starting point for future investigations of couples' social networks, especially couples whose relationships are stigmatized or marginalized in some way. Better understandings of the size, composition, and functions of same-sex couples' social networks are critically needed."

    "Abs": "The characteristics of a school's pupil population determine the boundaries within which friendships can grow at school, as pupils tend to develop friendships with others that are similar to them. This is an example of social homophily. Since language is an indicator of social status and identity, we aim at finding out whether it is a basis for social homophily. This study investigates what the effects of linguistic diversity on same-language friendships are for both multilingual pupils and pupils from Dutch-only homes and whether tolerant practices towards multilingualism impact friendship patterns. To get a deeper understanding of the context in which friendships develop, we examine pupils' perception of the language hierarchies in their school as well. We use a mixed-method design. The quantitative data analyzed in this article originate from a teacher and pupil survey in 67 primary schools in three highly diverse regions in Flanders during the 2012-2013 school year. The qualitative data have been gathered in two focus groups in which 24 pupils of the same school participated. Stepwise multilevel modeling showed that for multilingual pupils, a negative effect of tolerant practices towards multilingualism on same-language friendships existed, while linguistic diversity was of lesser importance. For pupils from Dutch-only homes, linguistic diversity had a negative effect on the number of same-language friendships and tolerance did not matter for friendship patterns. The insignificant effect of tolerance in pupils from Dutch-only homes can be explained by the strong dominance of Dutch, which the qualitative analysis also revealed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a unique dataset covering China's provincial leaders from 1979 to 2011, we develop a homophily index focusing on joint origin, joint education and joint work experience. We trace personal similarities in these respects between provincial leaders and members of China's supreme decision-making body, the Politbureau's Standing Committee.

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Incorporating the influence of social relationships effectively is fundamental to social recommendation (SR). However, most of the SR algorithms are based on the homophily assumption, where they ignored friends' different influence on users and users' different willingness to be influenced, which may make improper influence information integrated and harm the recommendation results. To address this, we propose a unified framework to properly incorporate the influence of social relationships into recommendation by the guidance of buddy (friends who have strong influence on user) and susceptibility (the willingness to be influenced) mining. Specifically, the Social Influence Propagation (SIP) method is proposed to identify each user's buddies and susceptibility and the Social Influence based Recommendation model is proposed to generate the final recommendation. Experiments on the real-world data demonstrate that the proposed framework can better utilize users' social relationships, resulting in increased recommendation accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Homophily and social influence are the main explanations for why there are more ties among people who have similar socio-demographic or behavioral characteristics. Homophily refers to the phenomenon that people are more likely to make relational ties with others who are similar to themselves than those who are not, whereas social influence refers to the phenomenon that an individual's behavior is likely to become more similar to that of her friends over time. It is important to study both homophily and social influence processes of a social network because each process can lead to different structural characteristics for a social network; homophily can lead to separation among the members of a network, whereas social influence can lead to network-wide uniformity. In this study, we examine homophily and social influence processes among online casual game players. Specifically, we ask whether an online casual game player tends to be friends with other online casual game players who have similar game genre preferences and whether a player's genre preferences and gaming frequencies become more similar to those of her Kongregate friends over time. For this study, demographic attributes, game genre preferences, gaming frequencies, and relational ties for 2488 game players were collected for two time periods from Kongregate. The panel data were analyzed with RSiena, the R version of SIENA (Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis), a social network analysis program used for social network panel data. The results suggest that there might not be strong homophily and social influence processes operating among the game players in the sampled network. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "This paper expands on Peterson's process model for historical changes in jazz. Peterson suggests that, given certain circumstances, musical genres migrate from 'low-brow' to 'high-brow'. I test this proposition for jazz by investigating whether bandleaders were associated through the same sidemen ('sidemen overlap') across time, and the underlying logics leading to these overlaps. I confirm Peterson's model to the extent that sidemen overlap shifts from a 'commercial' logic to a 'style-based' logic. From 1930 to 1949, sidemen overlap between bandleaders is mainly predicted by recording session volumes (akin to 'commercial logic'). From 1945 to 1969, style similarity emerges as an important predictor of sidemen overlap. I extend Peterson's process model by providing a more nuanced account, based on social networks. I show substantive collaboration across styles. As a consequence, stylistic shifts are not as abrupt as originally depicted. I also explore how past associations become increasingly stronger in terms of explaining sidemen overlap. Furthermore, race emerges as an important variable in explaining the same phenomenon. During the thirties, non-African-American homophily is high. After this period, African-American homophily increases steadily until the late fifties, decreasing again during the sixties.

These apps allow users to create and view public profiles, send photos, and text messages, and connect with other users based on shared interests and geographic proximity. The present study examined substance use homophily among a sample of 295 MSM recruited via a popular GSN app. Comparisons of social network members met via GSN app versus elsewhere and associations between both individual and network characteristics and recent binge drinking, marijuana use, and illicit substance use were explored using bivariate tests of association and multivariate logistic regression analyses. High rates of recent binge drinking (59 %), marijuana use (37 %), and illicit substance use (27 %) were observed among participants. GSN app use greater than 1 year and showing naked chest or abs in a profile picture were positively associated with recent illicit substance use. In multivariate analyses, the strongest predictors of binge drinking (AOR 3.81; 95 % CI 1.86-7.80), marijuana use (AOR 4.12; 95 % CI 2.22-7.64), and illicit substance use (AOR 6.45; 95 % CI 3.26-12.79) were the presence of a social network member who also engaged in these behaviors. Social network interventions that target binge drinking, marijuana use, and illicit substance use may be delivered via GSN apps to reduce the prevalence of substance use and related risks among MSM in these virtual contexts."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Partnership ties shape friendship networks through different social forces. First, partnership ties drive clustering in friendship networks: individuals who are in a partnership tend to have common friends and befriend other couples. Second, partnership ties influence the level of homophily in these emerging friendship clusters. Partners tend to be similar in a number of attributes (homogamy). If one partner selects friends based on preferences for homophily, then the other partner may befriend the same person regardless of whether they also have homophilic preferences. Thus, two homophilic ties emerge based on a single partner's preferences. This amplification of homophily can be observed in many attributes (e.g., ethnicity, religion, age). Gender homophily, however, may be de-amplified, as the gender of partners differs in heterosexual partnerships. In our study, we follow dynamic friendship formation among 126 individuals and their cohabiting partners in a university-related graduate housing community over a period of nine months (N = 2,250 self-reported friendship relations). We find that partnership ties strongly shape the dynamic process of friendship formation. They are a main driver of local network clustering and explain a striking amount of homophily."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Afrikaans education institutions are increasingly coming under fire, because the use of Afrikaans is believed to lead to a lack of integration between different population groups in South Africa. Afrikaans is seen as a white language, while it is argued that black students attend classes in English, which means that the separation of students in terms of language also allegedly leads to a separation in terms of race. The proposal is then that by removing Afrikaans as a medium of instruction, South African education institutions will become integrated.This article critically engages with this view from the perspective of complex network theory by investigating community formation in networks. The concepts of modularity and transitivity or clustering, as developed within the field of complex network theory, are discussed with reference to examples of different types of networks. Modularity provides a way of quantifying whether distinct groups of nodes emerge in a network, while transitivity refers to the formation of triangles in a network. Modularity and transitivity are calculated for a number of real networks, and compared with Erdos and Renyi (1960) type network models where link formation occurs at random. It is shown that community formation is not peculiar to South African society or even social networks in general, but is a characteristic of complex networks, which include social networks as well as technological, biological and information networks.Community formation arises partly as a result of assortativity or homophily, which means that similar nodes tend to form links with each other. Homophily in social networks can be based on language, but also manifests on the grounds of race, class, income group, geographical location and so on. An overview is given of a number of studies that investigated community formation in social networks, including in terms of language, such as Blondel et al.'s (2008) study of language communities in Belgium, or Leskovec and Horvitz's (2007) study of the Microsoft Instant Messaging (IM) network Although it is shown that quantitative evidence exists that language does lead to the formation of distinct communities, some studies of community formation in the monolingual environment of the United States are also discussed, including Moody's (2001) study of race relations amongst high school students, where it was shown that homogenous communities also emerge without language being a variable. In addition, some quantitative evidence is also provided for community formation based on age and geographical location.The conclusion the article arrives at is that integration will not be brought about by removing Afrikaans from education institutions, since the monolingual environment of the United States is still characterized by separate communities that are formed on the basis of race. The wide-spread occurrence of communities in networks indicates that it is a salient feature of networks, and that when removing one variable, another will still result in the formation of distinct communities. A brief discussion is also given of problems associated with the formation of social ties based on heterophily, i.e.where social ties are formed based on difference rather than similarity."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Racial prejudice and stereotyping in gay and bisexual communities may be important contextual factors that contribute to racial disparities in HIV. In an effort to challenge race-based stereotypes regarding gay and bisexual men's sexuality, we sought to determine the extent to which race and ethnicity were associated with (1) racial homophily (i.e., same-race partnerships), (2) sexual behavior (e.g., number of partners, condomless anal sex (CAS), sexual position (top/versatile/bottom)), and (3) perceived penis size and size satisfaction. Data were taken from a survey of 1,009 gay and bisexual men recruited using a street-intercept method at gay, lesbian, and bisexual community events in NYC in 2006-15 % Black, 61 % White, 18 % Latino, and 6 % Asian/Pacific Islander (mean age, 35.7). There was strong evidence of racial homophily (i.e., having a partner of the same race) among men who were in relationships, particularly for White and Black men. Race and ethnicity was largely unassociated with multiple dimensions of sexual behavior (e.g., number of partners, CAS, sexual positioning). Although we observed some racial and ethnic differences in perceived penis size that were consistent with stereotypes, the magnitudes of the differences were insufficient to justify the stereotype. As well, there were no significant differences with regard to satisfaction with penis size or lying to others about penis size. The disproportionate HIV prevalence among Black and Latino men does not appear to be as a result of differences in sexual behavior (e.g., CAS, number of partners) and race-based sexual stereotypes were largely unsupported by empirical data."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "This paper analyses the causality between interethnic ties and socioeconomic status (SES) for Italian, Turkish and former Yugoslavian immigrants in Germany. Referring to social capital theory and its inherent problem of homophily, the interrelation between these two constructs remains ambiguous. The data come from the German socioeconomic panel study. After demonstrating the drawbacks of existing empirical studies on this issue, results of fixed effects panel regressions and autoregressive cross-lagged panel models (ARM) with latent variables are presented. In this respect, the latter are considered more appropriate to tackle the formulated questions. To counter common criticism of ARM, an unmeasured variable model is computed in order to control for spurious relationships. After accounting for simultaneity, reverse causality and unobserved heterogeneity, the interethnic ties of immigrants positively influence the respondents' SES. In the strictest test, no significant reverse effect remains. Hence, the results support social capital theory."

The data comes from a 2011 survey of Mainland undergraduates at a university in Hong Kong and from in-depth interviews with students. We found a strong in-group pattern in the friendship networks of these students. More than 60% do not have good local friends. On a campus where nearly 90% of the students are locals, on average, only 18% of the good friends named by Mainland students are locals. We find that cultural differencessuch as the language barrier, differences in values and ideologies, and differences in academic orientation and future plandiscourage formation of intergroup friendship. But intergroup contacts, as indicated by participation in local organizations, have positive effects on intergroup friendship formation. Both contact opportunities and their timing (i.e., when they become available) are important. During their first year, Mainland students have many more opportunities to interact with other Mainlanders than with local students. This may also be an important factor accounting for the strong in-group pattern in Mainland students' friendship networks."

    "Abs": "Cultures of caste in much of rural India have become entangled with institutions of rural development. In community-driven development, emphasis on \"local resource persons\" and \"community spokespersons\" has created new opportunities for brokerage and patronage within some villages, which interact with existing forms of authority and community afforded by caste identity and intra-caste headmanship. In this article, we study how these entangled cultures of caste and development translate into social network structures using data on friendship ties from a south Indian village. We find that although caste continues to be important in shaping community structures and leadership in the village's network, its influence varies across different communities. This fluidity of caste's influence on community network structures is argued to be the result of multiple distinct yet partially overlapping cultural-political forces, which include sharedness afforded by caste identity and new forms of difference and inequality effected through rural development."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Trust, as a major part of human interactions, plays an important role in helping users collect reliable information and make decisions. However, in reality, user-specified trust relations are often very sparse and follow a power law distribution; hence inferring unknown trust relations attracts increasing attention in recent years. Social theories are frameworks of empirical evidence used to study and interpret social phenomena from a sociological perspective, while social networks reflect the correlations of users in real world; hence, making the principle, rules, ideas and methods of social theories into the analysis of social networks brings new opportunities for trust prediction. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit homophily and social status in trust prediction by modeling social theories. We first give several methods to compute homophily coefficient and status coefficient, then provide a principled way to model trust prediction mathematically, and propose a novel framework, hsTrust, which incorporates homophily theory and status theory. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further experiments are conducted to understand the importance of homophily theory and status theory in trust prediction."

While the three are mutually supportive, perceived social distance and offline contacts had greater explanatory value than online contacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Drawing on a random sample of Chinese Canadian entrepreneurs, this research examines the nexus of social networks, Internet use, and the gender gap in business performance. Results reveal a marked gender difference in firm size, which becomes narrowed after social networks, voluntary association participation, Internet use, and business characteristics are controlled. More important, network composition and structural position have different implications for men and women entrepreneurs. Men are more effective in converting relational advantages into business advantages. Interaction effects suggest that kin homophily hurts women's business performance but not men's. Yet, women gain more from participating in transnational entrepreneurship."

    "Abs": "Adolescents' school-based friendship networks tend to be segregated along ethnic lines. But few studies have examined whether variation in network boundaries affects the degree of ethnic friendship segregation. We use rational-choice theory to argue that ethnic homophily is more pronounced for friendships between classrooms than for those within classrooms. We empirically test this hypothesis using two-wave German panel data (N=1258) and stochastic actor-oriented models (RSiena). In line with our theoretical argument, we find that the tendency to form same-ethnic friendships is indeed stronger at the grade level, which translates into stronger ethnic segregation in friendship networks at the grade level than at the classroom level. Implications for research on ethnic segregation in school-based friendship networks are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Extensive agent-based simulations demonstrate that the optimal strategy fundamentally depends on the goal and time of intervention. Moreover, the nature of the social network (determined by homophily type and level) moderates the effectiveness of a strategy. These results have substantial implications for the design and evaluation of intervention programs."

By relying on social network analysis (SNA) methods, this study examines how news/opinions diffuse and how they interact and influence each other's ideological frame within agencies sharing the same ideology and between agencies whose ideologies contrast. The results show that public discourse on the Internet is clearly polarized and fragmented along political ideological lines. Additionally, the findings show that the winner is the conservative bloc because it succeeds in achieving within-bloc solidarity and ensures the resonance of news frames with the cultural values of Korean society.

Using data from NELLS, a nationally representative survey of the Dutch population aged 15-45 years, results show that within this age group access to social capital increases with age and educational qualifications, and is lower among women. Residing in a less affluent neighbourhood and scoring lower on a measurement for cognitive abilities are associated with less social capital. Participation in voluntary associations and having an ethnically diverse network are associated with more access to social capital. Surprisingly, when studying differences across national origin groups, we do not find that Turkish immigrants are disadvantaged in access to social capital."

My findings suggest, however, that feelings of community can develop despite incongruous ideologies through the perception of shared beliefs and values. Using an ethnographic case of a voluntary non-profit organization, I demonstrate how three types of mechanisms operate jointly to maintain a community without shared beliefs: environmental mechanisms related to the division of labor, relational mechanisms associated with selective recruitment and homophily, and a cognitive mechanism that produces the feeling of consensus in the absence of objectively shared beliefs. These mechanisms combine to allow a powerful experience of community to flourish in a context where we might expect, based on previous research, no community experience at all. Implications for the study of community, sociology of organizations, and social psychology are discussed."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Previous research has suggested that religious belief is associated with a range of prosocial behaviors such as social embeddedness and generosity. However, this literature has often conflated belief in God with group involvement and failed to control for demographic and social network effects. Rather than assessing prosociality by comparing religious group members with the unaffiliated, the present study also includes secular/nonreligious group members. Multiple regression analyses controlling for confounds diminishes many of the apparent differences between religious and nonreligious individuals. Belief in God itself accounts for approximately 1-2 % of the variance in social embeddedness domains and < 1 % of the variance in the domains of outside-group charity and community volunteering. Belief in God is associated with homophily and parochial behavior such as within-group charitable donations and constrained contact with different others. These findings indicate that prosocial benefits are more related to general group membership equally available to religious and secular group members alike than they are to specifically religious content. Religious beliefs are related to within-group prosociality as well as homophily and parochialism directed to those outside the group."

We sent email inquiries to 3,120 churches across the United States. The emails were ostensibly from someone moving to the area and looking for a new church to attend. That person's name was randomly varied to convey different racial and ethnic associations. In response to these inquiries, representatives from mainline Protestant churcheswho generally embrace liberal, egalitarian attitudes toward race relationsactually demonstrated the most discriminatory behavior. They responded most frequently to emails with white-sounding names, somewhat less frequently to black- or Hispanic-sounding names, and much less to Asian-sounding names. They also sent shorter, less welcoming responses to nonwhite names. In contrast, evangelical Protestant and Catholic churches showed little variation across treatment groups in their responses. These findings underscore the role of homophily, organizational homogeneity, and the costs of racial integration in perpetuating the racial segregation of American religious life."

    "Abs": "Results from two studies on longitudinal friendship networks are presented, exploring the impact of a gratitude intervention on positive and negative affect dynamics in a social network. The gratitude intervention had been previously shown to increase positive affect and decrease negative affect in an individual but dynamic group effects have not been considered. In the first study, the intervention was administered to the whole network. In the second study, two social networks are considered and in each only a subset of individuals, initially low/high in negative affect respectively received the intervention as \"agents of change\". Data was analyzed using stochastic actor-based modeling techniques to identify resulting network changes, impact on positive and negative affect and potential contagion of mood within the group. The first study found a group level increase in positive and a decrease in negative affect. Homophily was detected with regard to positive and negative affect but no evidence of contagion was found. The network itself became more volatile along with a fall in rate of change of negative affect. Centrality measures indicated that the best broadcasters were the individuals with the least negative affect levels at the beginning of the study. In the second study, the positive and negative affect levels for the whole group depended on the initial levels of negative affect of the intervention recipients. There was evidence of positive affect contagion in the group where intervention recipients had low initial level of negative affect and contagion in negative affect for the group where recipients had initially high level of negative affect."

    "Abs": "Since Merton's classical analysis of cumulative advantage in science, it has been observed that status hierarchies display a sizable disconnect between actors' quality and rank and that they become increasingly asymmetric over time, without, however, turning into winner-take-all structures. In recent years, formal models of status hierarchies tried to account for these facts by combining two micro-level, counterbalancing mechanisms: social influence (supposedly driving inequality) and the desire for reciprocation in deferential gestures (supposedly limiting inequality). In the article, we adopt as empirical benchmark basic features that are common to most distributions of status indicators (e.g., income, academic prestige, wealth, social ties) and argue that previous formal models were only partially able to reproduce such macro-level patterns. We then introduce a novel agent-based computational model of deferential gestures that improves on the realism of previous models by introducing heuristic-based decision making, actors' heterogeneity, and status homophily in social interactions. We systematically and extensively study the model's parameter space and consider a few variants to determine under which conditions the macroscopic patterns of interest are more likely to appear. We find that specific forms of status-based heterogeneity in actors' propensity to interact with status-dissimilar others are needed to generate status hierarchies that best approximate these macroscopic features."

Many studies have found moment-in-time evidence of network homophily, but very few have been able to directly measure longitudinal changes in the diversity of social media users' habits. This is due in part to a lack of appropriate tools and methods for such investigations. This study takes a step toward developing those methods. Drawing on the complete historical record of public retweets posted between January 2011 and August 2013, we propose and justify a partial method of measuring increases or decreases in network homophily. We demonstrate that Twitter network communities that focused on Syria are in general highly fragmented and homophilous; however, only one of the nine detected network communities that persisted over time exhibited a clear increase in homophily."

We discuss these results in light of existing research on online social relationships and describe how digital data and network analytics enable novel insights about the emergence of online social relationships."

Our longitudinal model is based on a unique data set of 1,354 researchers who helped create the new scientific field of oncofertility, by collaborating on 469 publications over a 4-year period. We capture the differences among researchers along cognitive, country, and gender dimensions, as well as examine how the resulting diversity or homophily influences the formation of collaborative innovation networks. We find that innovation, operationalized as publishing in a new scientific discipline, benefits from both homophily and diversity. Homophily in country of residence and working with prior collaborators help reduce uncertainty in the interactions associated with innovation, while diversity in knowledge enables the recombinant knowledge required for innovation."

This paper is an investigation of retention in the popular community blogging platform \"Blogster.\" We use the points users earn for their activities as a proxy of retention and explore the attributes that are associated with their retention. We find that highly retained users are most central in the network and their blogger friends are mutually less connected. They get more views and comments to their posted blogs. We also examine the homophily of retention in the social network. Based on our empirical observations, we build a classifier that is able to detect top retained users with accuracy as high as 94%.

Building relationships, convenience of networking, and expanding online branding opportunities have been recorded as the perceived benefits of using Twitter. The paper records tourism Twitter accounts of 37 European countries. It also records indexes of Twitter performance and influence and indexes of followers' community involvement. Next, the mentions/replies (m/r) network of the followers for each account is constructed in order to study whether it demonstrates community characteristics. Clustering coefficient, assortativity, and degree skewness are used as network indexes to explore whether m/r networks present the properties of small-worlds and scale-free networks, and are characterized by homophily. These indexes are then associated with Twitter performance indexes to explore how m/r networks differentiate across accounts of different popularity and performance. Findings reveal that m/r networks of followers do not constitute communities, but rather the people use tourism organizations' Twitter accounts as announcement boards or as one more channel for one-way communication with the public."

    "Abs": "Recent research on social contagion has demonstrated significant effects of network topology on the dynamics of diffusion. However, network topologies are not given a priori. Rather, they are patterns of relations that emerge from individual and structural features of society, such as population composition, group heterogeneity, homophily, and social consolidation. Following Blau and Schwartz, the author develops a model of social network formation that explores how social and structural constraints on tie formation generate emergent social topologies and then explores the effectiveness of these social networks for the dynamics of social diffusion. Results show that, at one extreme, high levels of consolidation can create highly balkanized communities with poor integration of shared norms and practices. As suggested by Blau and Schwartz, reducing consolidation creates more crosscutting circles and significantly improves the dynamics of social diffusion across the population. However, the author finds that further reducing consolidation creates highly intersecting social networks that fail to support the widespread diffusion of norms and practices, indicating that successful social diffusion can depend on moderate to high levels of structural consolidation."

Moreover, most ideological differences in lifestyle cannot be explained by demographic covariates alone. The authors propose a surprisingly simple solution to the puzzle of lifestyle politics. Computational experiments show how the self-reinforcing dynamics of homophily and influence dramatically amplify even very small elective affinities between lifestyle and ideology, producing a stereotypical world of \"latte liberals\" and \"bird-hunting conservatives\" much like the one in which we live."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Inequality between groups is frequently maintained through the construction and legitimation of inter-group cultural differences. I draw on Blau's multiform heterogeneity and complex contagion models to theorize and develop a relational mechanism that shows how inequality can be preserved when additional, new bases of differentiating between groups layer over existing ones. I investigate the conditions under which variations in the distribution of the population across stratified groups and homophily of social networks along the stratifying attribute interact in such a way that a belief/practice diffuses widely in one group but not the other-an outcome referred to as differential diffusion. I also analyze how size of ego networks and adoption thresholds affect differential diffusion. Using mathematical and agent-based models, I find a positive correlation between adoption thresholds and homophily: when social networks are highly homophilous (e.g., race and socioeconomic class), uneven diffusion of non-normative behavior reproduces inequality; inclusive networks (e.g., in diverse city schools), in contrast, reestablish inequality through differential diffusion of low-risk behavior. This suggests that cultivating diversity is likely to mitigate inequality preservation in conservative situations where adoption of new beliefs/practices needs considerable affirmation. Encouraging status-based solidarity is more appropriate in receptive contexts where adoption of new behaviors entails comparatively lower risk. The results also imply that analyses of diffusion need to be sensitive to contextual factors, including homophily, cultural institutionalization of the diffusing material, and population distribution. Finally, I extend Ridgeway's seminal work to show how relational structure can not only construct status hierarchies but also contribute to their symbolic maintenance."

We use data from the Flemish Educational Assessment Study, which collected complete network data from a representative sample of Flemish secondary school adolescents (N = 11,872). Results indicate that similarity on gender and ethnicity is linked with similarity on behavioural characteristics. Furthermore, the association between status homophily and behavioural homophily is stronger for boys than girls. For minorities, status heterophily on ethnicity is associated with behavioural heterophily, which may be an indication that minority students distance themselves from their majority-group friends."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "This article builds on group position theory and the subcategorization model of intergroup contact by illustrating how, in a small-town settler-colonial context, contact tends to reproduce, rather than challenge, the inequitable racial structure. In Northwestern Ontario, Indigenous-settler relations are characterized by widespread intergroup marriage and friendship as well as pervasive prejudice and discrimination. Using 18 months of fieldwork and 160 interviews and surveys with First Nations, Metis, and non-Indigenous residents, I show that although contact is associated with less old-fashioned prejudice (i.e., overt categorical hostility), it does not necessarily eliminate whites' superior sense of group position. Even white individuals who have close Indigenous friends or spouses often express laissez-faire racism. Three mutually reinforcing social processessubtyping, ideology-based homophily, and political avoidance normsinteract to sustain whites' sense of group superiority and justifications for racial inequity. These processes are facilitated by historical and structural conditions, in this case colonization and small-town dynamics."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Homophily is a significant mechanism for link prediction in complex network, of which principle describes that people with similar profiles or experiences tend to tie with each other. In a multi-relationship network, friendship among people has been utilized to reinforce similarity of taste for recommendation system whose basic idea is similar to homophily, yet how the taste inversely affects friendship prediction is little discussed. This paper contributes to address the issue by analyzing two benchmark data sets both including user's behavioral information of taste and friendship based on the principle of homophily. It can be found that the creation of friendship tightly associates with personal taste. Especially, the behavioral information of taste involving with popular objects is much more effective to improve the performance of friendship prediction. However, this result seems to be contradictory to the finding in Zhang et al. (2013) that the behavior information of taste involving with popular objects is redundant in recommendation system. We thus discuss this inconformity to comprehensively understand the correlation between them. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "It is generally accepted that the driving forces of establishing connections among people are social influence and homophily. Both of them eventually lead to the proximity of any two related individuals to some extent. However, a person always can be featured with some attributes different from his/her social networking partners. Accordingly, one person's direct and indirect social relationships are likely to intersect with others at some nodes in social networks. In this work, we study the novel task of identifying the hidden boundary that divides the social network into disjoint social circles according to any pair of nodes which we call social boundary. We put forward two methods to separate the social circles of any two nodes and thus can find out the social boundary. One is based on label propagation and the other is based on perceptron network model. We apply the methods on synthetic and real networks, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the areas in which it would be applied."

Extant research has considered the influence that political homophily, environmental activism, and pressure groups play in the spread of sustainability policies. But to what extent do concerns over environmental justice motivate local government adoption of green building, development, and remodeling programs? This study begins to disentangle these questions by asking: do cities within regions with higher levels of social inequality adopt green building policies less frequently than those in areas of lower inequality? Using national survey data, we find measures of wealth and \"reformed\" government positively influence the use of green-building tools, while regional income inequality dampens these effects."

    "Abs": "The vast increase of personal sensor information is driving the rise in popularity of context-aware applications. Users crave and very often expect tailored services that are based on the users' context or personal preferences. The users themselves, using forms, often provide such information. An inference solution typically addresses this problem. In this paper, we present and show by way of a real-world example, the first step towards incorporating information of the user's social networking behavior in the inference task. We define an initial indicator of a particular social phenomenon, called Homophily, and describe how the indicator measures the presence of homophily at certain moments, also capturing the degree to which it is present. Different from existing indicators, ours lends itself to indicating the presence of homophily in a way that is easier to comprehend, so that it may be easily integrated into and reinforce context-aware semantic computing."

In order to give a comprehensive estimation of senators' political positions, some researchers estimated the ideal points on different topics. However, for those senators who are not that polarized, their ideal points are so sensitive to the voting records that even a small change will make a big difference, which may mislead the readers.In this paper, we propose a mass ideology-based voting model taking the senators' latent ideology into consideration. Firstly, we model the senators' general ideal points by using the following links on Twitter due to the reason that we have homophily in social networks. Secondly, we use the roll call data of different bills, which can be decomposed as a combination of different topics, to estimate the senator's adjustment on different topics. Finally, we combine the general ideal points and the adjustments together to analyze the senator's political positions. Additionally, two-stage learning algorithms are also shown in the following section. Compared with the Issued-Adjusted model, our model has an edge on classifying the senators on different topics. This model can also be used to predict the voting behavior. Then, we show a case study of a moderate senator and try to explain her voting behavior for some bills according to our research."

    "Abs": "It is well known that many social networks follow the homophily principle, dictating that individuals tend to connect with similar peers. Past studies focused on non-topological properties, such as the age, gender, beliefs or educations. In this paper we focus precisely on the topology itself, exploring the possible existence of pairwise role dependency, that is, purely structural homophily. We show that while pairwise dependency is necessary for some structural roles, it may be misleading for others. We also present SR-Diffuse, a novel method for identifying the structural roles of nodes within a network. It is an iterative algorithm following an optimization model able to learn simultaneously from topological features and structural homophily, combining both aspects. For assessing our method, we applied it in a classification problem in information cascades, comparing its performance against several baseline methods. The experimental results with Flickr and Digg data show that SR-Diffuse can improve the quality of the discovered roles and can better represent the profile of the individuals, leading to a better prediction of social classes within information cascades."

Drawing from homophily and resource dependence theoiy, this research aims to understand NGOs' hyperlink networks from their social media activity. Four findings emerge from our study. First, hyperlink networks interact with social media activities. Second, hyperlink networks are shaped by both homophily and resource dependence. However, resource dependence theory better explains hyperlink networks. Third, in line with cohort effects, length of time since social media adoption matters for hyperlink network; early social media adopters were more likely to hyperlink to early adopters. Fourth, the number of posts is a better activity predictor for NGOs' hyperlink networks than number of accounts followed."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Diffusion is an important dynamics that helps spreading information within an online social network. While there are already numerous models for single item diffusion, few have studied diffusion of multiple items, especially when items can interact with one another due to their inter-similarity. Moreover, the well-known homophily effect is rarely considered explicitly in the existing diffusion models. This work therefore fills this gap by proposing a novel model called Topic level Interaction Homophily Aware Diffusion (TIHAD) to include both latent factor level interaction among items and homophily factor in diffusion. The model determines item interaction based on latent factors and edge strengths based on homophily factor in the computation of social influence. An algorithm for training TIHAD model is also proposed. Our experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that: (a) homophily increases diffusion significantly, and (b) item interaction at topic level boosts diffusion among similar items. A case study on hashtag diffusion in Twitter also shows that TIHAD outperforms the baseline model in the hashtag adoption prediction task."

This approach has a wide range of potential applications, e.g. collecting complaints from the customers of a new product while most of them are satisfied. We formally define the problem of computing such group with better utilization as the p-biased-representative selection problem (p-BRSP). This problem has two separate objectives and is difficult to deal with. Thus, we also propose a new unified-objective which is a function of the two optimization objectives. Most importantly, we introduce two polynomial time heuristic algorithms for the problem, where each of which has an approximation ratio with respect to each of the objectives."

Sites such as TripAdvisor roffer millions of reviews, and travelers often reduce that to a manageable amount by focusing on reviews by writers who show homophily, i.e.are similar to them in terms of travel interests. These sites represent a form of eWOM recommendation; what is not clear is how much they replace or augment traditional WOM.Design/methodology/approach - Dual-method content analysis of semi-structured interviews with a heterogeneous purposive sample of regular users of TripAdvisor ( N = 30), followed by a survey of TripAdvisor users (N = 237).Findings - Friends were considered the most credible information source, although friends showing greater homophily were more valued than others. However, in some circumstances, subjects found eWOMmore credible: when they wanted greater certainty in their hotel choice, so complete information was important; when the hotel was for a special occasion or special people; and for feelings of empowerment. Most subjects compared all sources rather than relying on one.Originality/value - This study reminds hotel managers that while eWOM is accessible and analyzable, it may not fully represent guests' opinions; hotels' marketing strategy should balance it with other recommendation networks. As guests compare sources, consistency in all forms of customer engagement is also essential."

    "Year": 2015,
    "Abs": "Understanding how much two individuals are alike in their interests (i.e., interest similarity) has become virtually essential for many applications and services in Online Social Networks (OSNs). Since users do not always explicitly elaborate their interests in OSNs like Facebook, how to determine users' interest similarity without fully knowing their interests is a practical problem. In this paper, we investigate how users' interest similarity relates to various social features (e.g. geographic distance); and accordingly infer whether the interests of two users are alike or unalike where one of the users' interests are unknown. Relying on a large Facebook dataset, which contains 479,048 users and 5,263,351 user-generated interests, we present comprehensive empirical studies and verify the homophily of interest similarity across three interest domains (movies, music and TV shows). The homophily reveals that people tend to exhibit more similar tastes if they have similar demographic information (e.g., age, location), or if they are friends. It also shows that the individuals with a higher interest entropy usually share more interests with others. Based on these results, we provide a practical prediction model under a real OSN environment. For a given user with no interest information, this model can select some individuals who not only exhibit many interests but also probably achieve high interest similarities with the given user. Eventually, we illustrate a use case to demonstrate that the proposed prediction model could facilitate decision-making for OSN applications and services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "Abs": "The paper investigates the integration of immigrant children and their parents in different dimensions of social networks - referred to as multiplexity in social network terminology. These dimensions are children's friendships, their attendance at birthday parties, and contact among their parents. By attending birthday parties, children's friendships are publicly reinforced and membership in a social circle is signified. During these events, communication and social exchange drive the process of social integration at the micro-level, and ethnic boundaries can be shifted or blurred. It will be shown that a variety of homophily effects can be found in all three network dimensions. In addition, ethnic segregation in parents' networks has an impact on children's participation in these events and, thereby, on children's integration in social networks. However, the causal effect in the other way around - children's birthday party attendance on contact among their parents - is even stronger. A new approach is the non-recursive analysis of how ties in one network dimension effect ties in another dimension. Analyses are based on 76 social networks of 1266 children in school classes in the city state of Bremen, Germany. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Our results show clear relations between the topological features of communities and the degree of homophily of their nodes in three online social scenarios: product engagement in the Skype network, number of listened songs on LastFM and homogeneous level of education among users of Google+."

Here, we investigate whether social media networks exhibit signs of homophily with regards to life stages. Using a large and global database (N = 111,863) of social media profile pictures, we investigate proportions of picture types in an individual's social network. Typical stages of young adulthood include peer group formation, mate searching, union formation, and parenting. We studied to what extent different association categories with pictures of one or several individuals correlated with each other. Results showed that users with a profile picture of a single individual were more likely to have other profile pictures of single individuals of the opposite sex, but not of the same sex, in their social media network. Profile pictures of heterosexual couples were more likely to appear with other heterosexual couple pictures, and profiles with baby pictures were strongly associated with the frequency of other baby pictures within the same network; both of these types were negatively associated with the frequency of pictures of singles. Pictures of two females together were positively linked with the largest number of other association types. The results probably reflect both selection and contagion effects. We conclude that contemporary social media networks appear to exhibit homophily in displays related to mate searching, pair bonds, and the transition to parenthood. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Modeling and predicting human behaviors, such as the level and intensity of physical activity, is a key to preventing the cascade of obesity and helping spread healthy behaviors in a social network. In our conference paper, we have developed a social influence model, named socialized Gaussian process (SGP), for socialized human behavior modeling. Instead of explicitly modeling social influence as individuals' behaviors influenced by their friends' previous behaviors, SGP models the dynamic social correlation as the result of social influence. The SGP model naturally incorporates personal behavior factor and social correlation factor (i.e., the homophily principle: Friends tend to perform similar behaviors) into a unified model. And it models the social influence factor (i.e., an individual's behavior can be affected by his/her friends) implicitly in dynamic social correlation schemes. The detailed experimental evaluation has shown the SGP model achieves better prediction accuracy compared with most of baseline methods. However, a Socialized Random Forest model may perform better at the beginning compared with the SGP model. One of the main reasons is the dynamic social correlation function is purely based on the users' sequential behaviors without considering other physical activity-related features. To address this issue, we further propose a novel \"multi-feature SGP model\" (mfSGP) which improves the SGP model by using multiple physical activity-related features in the dynamic social correlation learning. Extensive experimental results illustrate that the mfSGP model clearly outperforms all other models in terms of prediction accuracy and running time."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Background: Social integration and the health of adolescents with a migration background is a major concern in multicultural societies. The literature, however, has paid little attention to the wider determinants of their health behaviours, including the composition of their social networks. The aim of this study was to describe the composition of adolescents' social networks according to migration background, and to examine how social networks are associated with substance use.Method: In 2013, the SILNE study surveyed 11,015 secondary-school adolescents in 50 schools in six European cities in Belgium, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Portugal, using a social network design. Each adolescent nominated up to five of their best and closest friends. Migration status was defined as first-generation migrants, second-generation migrants, and speaking another language at home. We computed two groups of network structural positions, the centrality of individual adolescents in networks, and the homophily of their social ties regarding migration (same-migration). Multilevel logistic regression was used to model the association between network structural position and smoking, alcohol use, and cannabis use.Results: Compared with non-migrant adolescents, adolescents with migration backgrounds had similar relationship patterns. But almost half their social ties were with same-migration-background adolescents; non-migrants had few social ties to migrants. For adolescents with a migration background, a higher proportion of social ties with non-migrants was associated with increased use of cannabis (OR = 1.07, p = 0.03) and alcohol (OR = 1.08, p < 0.01), but not with increased smoking (p = 0.60). Popular migrant adolescents were at less risk of smoking, alcohol use, and cannabis use than popular non-migrant adolescents.Conclusion: Homophily of social ties by migration background is noticeable in European schools. The tendency of migrant adolescents to have same-migration social ties may isolate them from non-migrant adolescents, but also reduces their risky health behaviours, in particular cannabis and alcohol use.

This paper examines the construction of ethnic boundaries in inter-group relations by focusing on the tension between ethnic hierarchy and competition versus homophily- the preference for maintaining ties with persons who are similar.

Rather than focus on the personal traits of either potential recruits or recruiters for this initial stage of recruitment, we develop and test a theoretical framework that emphasizes the importance of shared relationships and characteristics between those doing the recruiting and those being recruited. Specifically, the nature of interactions, overlapping community and associational space, status and value homophily, and strength and intimacy are assessed to explain differential recruitment among people's closest ties. Furthermore, unlike previous studies, we do so across three different forms of civic activity blood donation, volunteer work, and political activism allowing us to identify larger patterns in civic solicitation. Results from multilevel analyses of dyads reorganized from ego-centric data of U.S. adults show that while certain personal traits of egos and alters remain significant, attributes of the dyad are equally, if not more, consequential for explaining variation in who gets asked to participate in civic activity. Importantly, while certain dyadic characteristics such as romantic partnerships promote recruitment to all three forms of civic activity, the effects of others such as sex homophily are unique to specific forms. Broadly speaking, our results indicate that some types of dyadic characteristics are more powerful than others and that there are important differences in how particular dimensions of social connections shape recruitment efforts across the specific activities of donating blood, volunteering time, and engaging in political activism.

First, it is possible to distinguish between off-line (player) and online (avatar) characteristics. Second, these environments offer new possibilities for studying friendship formation. By tracking friendship requests and their acceptance rate, researchers are able to distinguish between with whom players want to become friends and with whom they actually do become friends. This article examined friendship formation in Timik, a graphical virtual world targeted at Polish teenagers. Homophily, preferential attachment and status were tested as possible underlying mechanisms. Results showed that preferential attachment and status drove invitations: Players wanted to become friends with high-status players. However, high-status players were also more likely to reject offers. Homophily only played a minor role. Players preferred players of the same avatar class and similar age but of the opposite sex. Too similar avatars were disliked. The results are discussed in the light of the generalizability of off-line theories of friendship formation to online worlds."

However, Monte Carlo estimation of ERGM parameters is a computationally intensive procedure that imposes severe limits on the size of full networks that can be fitted. We demonstrate the use of snowball sampling and conditional estimation to estimate ERGM parameters for large networks, with the specific goal of studying the validity of inference about the presence of such effects as network closure and attribute homophily. We estimate parameters for snowball samples from the network in parallel, and combine the estimates with a meta-analysis procedure. We assess the accuracy of this method by applying it to simulated networks with known parameters, and also demonstrate its application to networks that are too large (over 40000 nodes) to estimate social circuit and other more advanced ERGM specifications directly. We conclude that this approach offers reliable inference for closure and homophily. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "Abs": "Models of network evolution are based on the implicit assumption that network growth is continuous, uniform, and steady. Using the data collected from a large online-blogging platform, we show that the addition and removal of network ties by users do not occur sporadically at isolated nodes spread all over the network, as assumed by the vast majority of stochastic network models, but rather occur in brief bursts of intense local activity.These bursts of network growth and attrition (addition and removal of network ties) are highly localized around focal nodes. Such network changes coincide with nearly instantaneous densification of the ties between the affected nodes, resulting in an increase of local clustering. Furthermore, we find that these network changes are tightly coupled to the dynamics of individual attributes, particularly the increase in homology between neighboring nodes (homophily) within the scope of the burst. Coincidence of the localized network change with the increase in homophily suggests a strong coupling between the selection and influence processes that lead to simultaneous elevation of assortativity and clustering."

Intra-class correlation, homophily hypothesis testing, and exponential random graph models were used to test friendship homophily based on sun safety behaviors. Peer Leaders were identified through social network popularity, and sun safety change scores were compared between Peer Leaders and non-leaders. Results show that students cluster based on shared demographic characteristics and some sun safety behaviors, and that there was a trend for Peer Leaders to respond better to the SunSmart intervention than non-leaders. Implications for future sun safety interventions using Peer Leaders as champions for sun safety behavior change are discussed."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Racial homophily (partnering with those of the same race) has been suggested as contributing to racial disparities in HIV among gay and bisexual men (GBM). Using a daily diary study, we examined racial homophily and its role in anal sexual behaviors in a sample of highly sexually active Black, White, and Latino GBM (N= 294, n= 3107 sexual events). In general, (1) men tended to partner with others of the same race, (2) HIV was more prevalent among men of color, and (3) race acted independent of whether one would engage in behaviors that would put them at highest risk for transmitting HIV (i.e., no main or interaction effects for insertive condomless anal sex (CAS) among HIV-positive men, and no main or interaction effects for receptive CAS among HIV negative men). There were some main and interactive effects observed for lower risk behaviors (receptive CAS among HIV positive men and insertive CAS among HIV-negative). Our findings suggest that racial disparities in HIV may be due to a higher exposure frequency (i.e., the frequency with which one comes into contact with a partner where a transmission could occur). However, men were also less likely to have anal sex when having sex with someone of the same race a finding that works against the premise of higher exposure frequency. Future researchers should examine both racial homophily as well as variation in sexual behavior based on same -race or different -race partnerships."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "This study examines the bases of residential segregation in a late nineteenth century American city, recognizing the strong tendency toward homophily within neighborhoods. Our primary question is how ethnicity, social class, nativity, and family composition affect where people live. Segregation is usually studied one dimension at a time, but these social differences are interrelated, and thus a multivariate approach is needed to understand their effects. We find that ethnicity is the main basis of local residential sorting, while occupational standing and, to a lesser degree, family life cycle and nativity also are significant. A second concern is the geographic scale of neighborhoods: in this study, the geographic area within which the characteristics of potential neighbors matter in locational outcomes of individuals. Studies of segregation typically use a single spatial scale, often one determined by the availability of administrative data. We take advantage of a unique data set containing the address and geo-referenced location of every resident. We conclude that it is the most local scale that offers the best prediction of people's similarity to their neighbors. Adding information at larger scales minimally improves prediction of the person's location. The 1880 neighborhoods of Newark, New Jersey, were formed as individuals located themselves among similar neighbors on a single street segment."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Bureaucratic and patrimonial theories of organized crime tend to miss the history and mobility of crime groups integrating into and organizing with legitimate society. The network property of multiplexitywhen more than one type of relationship exists between a pair of actorsoffers a theoretical and empirical inroad to analyzing overlapping relationships of seemingly disparate social spheres. Using the historical case of organized crime in Chicago and a unique relational database coded from more than 5,000 pages of archival documents, we map the web of multiplex relationships among bootleggers, politicians, union members, businessmen, families, and friends. We analyze the overlap of criminal, personal, and legitimate networks containing 1,030 individuals and 3,726 mutual dyads between them. Multiplexity is rare in these data: only 10 percent of the mutual dyads contain multiplex ties. However, results from bivariate exponential random graph models demonstrate that multiplexity is a relevant structural property binding the three networks together. Even among our sample of criminals, we find dependencies between the criminal and personal networks and the criminal and legitimate networks. Although not pervasive, multiplexity glued these worlds of organized crime together above and beyond the personalities of famous gangsters, ethnic homophily, and other endogenous network processes."

    "Abs": "To what extent do voluntary organizations like sports, leisure, and neighborhood associations provide a platform where ethnic groups mingle and ethnic boundaries are overcome? This study uses unique panel data from the Netherlands Longitudinal Life Course Study (NELLS) to shed light on the integrative power of voluntary associations. I investigate decisions to join and leave associations of different ethnic composition, as a member or a volunteer, among individuals of Turkish, Moroccan, and native Dutch origin. In general, all ethnic groups are equally likely to join voluntary organizations, but ethnic minorities are more likely to leave than are Dutch natives, even after accounting for relevant sociodemographic characteristics. This alone explains ethnic minorities' lower involvement rates. Moreover, joining decisions are characterized by strong ethnic sorting across organizations of different ethnic composition: people are much more likely to join associations containing fewer ethnic out-group members. This limits the potential of voluntary associations as pathways to social integration. In contrast, once the initial hurdle of getting involved has been taken, people are no more likely to disengage from organizations with more ethnic out-group members. Inter-ethnic neighborhood contact and the local supply of involvement opportunities are most influential in explaining the strong sorting tendencies in people's joining decisions."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "In recent years, the world of social media and online networking has met with the world of international development, leading to rapid changes in development practice and to the emergence of new fields of study. Proponents of this change argue that the Internet provides the tools for global cooperation and participation. However, the reality is less clear, with critics asserting that much of the Information and Communication Technology and networking discourse and practice is rooted in past approaches to development. This reflects a wider debate about whether ICT provides space for alternative views and social movements, or if it represents a new form of networked information colonialism. Drawing on ethnographic research with the online development-oriented network projecthonduras.com, this paper reflects on these debates, and on the wider implications of social media in development practice. An early model of peer-to-peer collaboration in development, projecthonduras.com has over a decade of networking experience and has been the catalyst for many connections and encounters, which have, at times, literally saved lives. However, while research with this network highlights some potential for disintermediated and inclusive networking, it also provides an example of a conventional development approach operating within an online space, and illustrates the impact of digital exclusion and homophily. Using the networking concepts of disintermediation, participation and diversity/homophily, this paper explores the structure and discourse of projecthonduras.com and illustrates the paradoxical nature of ICT and social media in development, providing a cautionary note to those who look to social media to provide answers to contemporary development dilemmas."

Specifically, we combine machine learning-based textual analysis with social network analysis to examine the structure and content of the discussion network which formed around the political aspects of food safety issues on China's Twitter-like Weibo. The findings suggest that Weibo-mediated communication space does not serve as an effective forum for deliberative discussion because people of like mind tend to cluster and the factor of emotion predominates. Further statistical analyses of a hand-coded sample show that emotional discussions influence people more than cognitive discussions, with distinct emotions (e.g., anger, fear and sadness) having different effects. A poster's status is also found to matter. We contend that this kind of online civic talk underlines an expressive form of rationality that transcends the dominant bipolar instrumental-communicative dimension for understanding the use of social media in online political discussion.

    "Abs": "We examine how race affects the employment status of subordinates following a job change by their immediate supervisors. We test whether racial homophily between a subordinate and a supervisor affects the odds of being let go. We also consider whether a racial match between an incoming head coach and assistant affects whether assistants retain their assistant coaching position. Data for these analyses come from a unique data set that explores what happens to 704 NCAA Division I college basketball assistant coaches after the head coach leaves the school. Logistic regression analyses confirm the benefit of working for a white head coach as this decreases the likelihood of being let go, compared to more positive outcomes such as following the coach to a new school, being internally promoted or retained after the head coach's departure. Furthermore, racial homophily with incoming head coaches insulates subordinates from having to search for new employment by increasing the likelihood of assistants being retained."

In this study, we aim to answer three key questions: (i) is there a correlation between online and offline interactions? (ii) how is the social tie developed via heterogeneous interaction channels? and (iii) would the development of social tie between two users be affected by their common friends? To achieve our goal, we develop a Social-aware Hidden Markov Model (SaHMM) that explicitly takes into account the factor of common friends in measure of the social tie development. Our experiments show that, comparing with results obtained using HMM and other heuristic methods, the social tie development captured by our SaHMM is significantly more consistent to lifetime profiles of users."

I construct a network model in which national markets are nodes and flows of recorded music between them are links and conduct a longitudinal analysis of the global pattern of trade in the period 1976-2010. I hypothesize that new export markets are developed through a process of transitive closure in the network of international trade. When two countries' markets experience the same social influences, it brings them close enough together for new homophilous ties to be formed. The implication is that consumption of foreign products helps, not hurts, home-market producers develop overseas markets, but only in those countries that have a history of consuming the same foreign products that were consumed in the home market. Selling in a market changes what is valued in that market, and new market formation is a consequence of having social influences in common."

The current study connects network structural concepts to theories of social capital, transaction costs, homophily, and resource dependency at multiple levels and evaluates transactional relationships for community rebuilding and local economic development. We examine the evolutionary process of dynamic networks among local residents or organization members with network configurations in one of the largest Japanese community currency systems, \"Peanuts.\" Using longitudinal network data over 12 years for approximately 1400 actors, we conclude that the evolution and achievement of transactional network dynamics and partner selections differ between the two groups of participants: individual members and organization members. We also provide practical implications for sustaining participants' transactions and commitment."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Gender homophily, or the preference for interaction with individuals of the same gender, has been observed in many contexts, especially during childhood and adolescence. In this study we investigate such phenomenon by analyzing the interactions of the similar to 10 million users of Tuenti, a Spanish social networking service popular among teenagers. In dyadic relationships we find evidence of higher gender homophily for women. We also observe a preference of users with more friends to connect to the opposite gender. A particularly marked gender difference emerges in signing up for the social networking service and adding the first friends, and in the interactions by means of wall messages. In these contexts we find evidence of a strong homophily for women, and little or no homophily for men. By examining the gender composition of triangle motifs, we observe a marked tendency of users to group into gender homogeneous clusters, with a particularly high number of male-only triangles. We show that age plays an important role in this context, with a tendency to higher homophily for young teenagers in both dyadic and triadic relationships. Our findings have implications for addressing gender gap issues, understanding adolescent online behavior and technology adoption, and modeling social networks."

    "Abs": "In this paper we consider whether people with similar personality traits have a preference for common locations. Due to the difficulty in tracking and categorising the places that individuals choose to visit, this is largely unexplored. However, the recent popularity of location-based social networks (LBSNs) provides a means to gain new insight into this question through checkins- records that are made by LBSN users of their presence at specific street level locations. A web-based participatory survey was used to collect the personality traits and checkin behaviour of 174 anonymous users, who, through their common check-ins, formed a network with 5373 edges and an approximate edge density of 35%. We assess the degree of overlap in personality traits for users visiting common locations, as detected by user checkins. We find that people with similar high levels of conscientiousness, openness or agreeableness tended to have checked-in locations in common. The findings for extraverts were unexpected in that they did not provide evidence of individuals assorting at the same locations, contrary to predictions. Individuals high in neuroticism were in line with expectations, they did not tend to have locations in common. Unanticipated results concerning disagreeableness are of particular interest and suggest that different venue types and distinctive characteristics may act as attractors for people with particularly selective tendencies. These findings have important implications for decision-making and location. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Players are modeled as solving the strategic-uncertainty problem of whether or not to act, by assuring each other of their willingness to act. We show that in equilibrium there may, but need not, be homophily (players with the same thresholds seek assurance from each other) or a threshold-based social hierarchy (players with high thresholds, or conservatives, seek assurance from players with low thresholds, or radicals, but not vice versa). Put otherwise, a new strategic-uncertainty problem arises, namely, the problem of who should seek assurance from whom. We propose that players solve this problem by forming core-periphery assurance networks, with a number of players equal to the largest threshold in the core, and the remaining players in the periphery."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "The greater prevalence of intraracial crime to interracial crime is a common finding in criminology. This issue is best understood when specific crimes are studied from a proper theoretical basis. We argue that variation in rates of cross-racial crime is explained by homophily bias, reflected in residential segregation, in conjunction with the motivational mindset of an offender, specifically whether a crime is instrumental or expressive in nature. We hypothesize that homophily bias is stronger in expressive crimes than it is in instrumental crimes. Using the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) for 2009 and 2010, we analyze robbery and aggravated assault as instrumental and expressive crimes, respectively. The analyses show that racial residential segregation increases, as expected, the relative frequency of black intraracial assault to black interracial assault, whereas it does not affect the relative frequency in robbery. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, the same variable shows little effect on the relative frequency of white intraracial to interracial assault. We give possible explanations as to why white crimes are insensitive to residential segregation."

The findings also show that frequency of participation in voluntary groups and number of voluntary associations participated have independent and significant positive relationships with socioeconomic range of contact and number of high-status contacts, except that the number of voluntary associations involved does not relate to the number of high-status contacts among immigrants. In addition, the findings show that receiving education overseas does not relate to the range of contact and high-status contact. However, visible minority immigrants significantly has lower socioeconomic range of contact than other immigrants even controlling for voluntary association participation."

    "Abs": "Citation networks have been widely used to study the evolution of science through the lenses of the underlying patterns of knowledge flows among academic papers, authors, research sub-fields, and scientific journals. Here we focus on citation networks to cast light on the salience of homophily, namely the principle that similarity breeds connection, for knowledge transfer between papers. To this end, we assess the degree to which citations tend to occur between papers that are concerned with seemingly related topics or research problems. Drawing on a large data set of articles published in the journals of the American Physical Society between 1893 and 2009, we propose a novel method for measuring the similarity between articles through the statistical validation of the overlap between their bibliographies. Results suggest that the probability of a citation made by one article to another is indeed an increasing function of the similarity between the two articles. Our study also enables us to uncover missing citations between pairs of highly related articles, and may thus help identify barriers to effective knowledge flows. By quantifying the proportion of missing citations, we conduct a comparative assessment of distinct journals and research sub-fields in terms of their ability to facilitate or impede the dissemination of knowledge. Findings indicate that Electromagnetism and Interdisciplinary Physics are the two sub-fields in physics with the smallest percentage of missing citations. Moreover, knowledge transfer seems to be more effectively facilitated by journals of wide visibility, such as Physical Review Letters, than by lower-impact ones. Our study has important implications for authors, editors and reviewers of scientific journals, as well as public preprint repositories, as it provides a procedure for recommending relevant yet missing references and properly integrating bibliographies of papers."

Data were collected from sport consumers who had received a recommendation to watch a sporting event in the preceding 3 months and actually watched the event.

We analyze data from the US, East Germany before 1989, and post-reform China, combining the first-difference method and Heckman selection procedure to deal with endogeneity. Empirical findings from different labor market contexts demonstrate that: (1) contact resources have a causal and positive role in job outcomes; (2) in a market economy, the role of resources is more salient if they provide within-occupation job-leads; (3) under state job-assignment systems occupational homophily does not pay off; and (4) job-search ties can take the form of heterophilous selection.

The opinion of each agent is represented by a sequence of arguments, and it evolves through the interactions between agents. The probability that one agent chooses another to communicate depends on the similarity of their opinions. During every interaction, interacting agents exchange the argument randomly selected from the corresponding arguments sequence. Theoretical analysis reveals that this model results in consensus on either extreme positive opinion or extreme negative opinion, or generates bi-polarization. Numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the dynamics of the model over different networks.

    "Abs": "Using panel village census data from Senegal, we assess the impact of a decentralized agricultural development program the Programme de Services Agricoles et Organisations de Producteurs (PSAOP) on membership and assortative matching in community-based organizations (CBOs). We find that channeling agricultural assistance through CBOs makes these organizations more inclusive in the sense that several tradition-bound assortative matching patterns are broken: homophily in ethnicity and wealth are reduced. Traditionally marginalized groups such as men of nomadic background, women with small landholdings and little education and those residing in female-headed households become CBO members whereas the position of previous CBO leaders is not reinforced. Similarly, those households that received services from a CBO before the PSAOP was in place are less likely to stay. This leads to more heterogeneous CBOs and is in line with the terms and conditions of the program. On the other hand, the likelihood of CBO membership is reduced in project villages, with significant differences between men and women. Women disproportionately drop out of CBOs which receive PSAOP benefits. We conclude that for grassroots-level development projects to be successful, contextual factors need to be integrated into program design and implementation, since they shape local participation. Understanding local power relations and the potential for changing preferences due to external support are key to inclusive participation and development at the local. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The method has the ability to integrate a variety of user activities based cues from user comments, user social network (i.e; follower/followee connections) and user interested topics which are indicated by the topics a user has participated in. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the prediction of each user's favorite team as a part of user preferences in a dataset collected from the Hu-pu basketball discussion forum.(1) Results clearly indicate that our proposed user representation outperforms other user representation baselines. Integrating user social network and user interested topics with user comments can improve the overall performance of user preference prediction."

Effects of homophily and triadic closure mechanisms are claimed to be important in terms of initiating new social interactions and in turn to shape the global social structure. This way they eventually provide some potential to predict the creation of social ties between disconnected people sharing common friends or common subjects of interest. In this paper we analyze a large Twitter data corpus and quantify similarities between people by considering the set of their common friends and the set of their commonly shared hashtags in order to predict mention links among them. We show that these similarity measures are correlated among connected people and that the combination of contextual and local structural features provides better predictions as compared to cases where they are considered separately. These results help us to better understand the evolution of egocentric and global social networks and provide advances in the design of better recommendation systems and resource allocation plans."

Using Gowalla data with 385,306 users, 3 million locations, and 35 million check-in records, we empirically estimate the model to find evidence on the homophily effect on network formation. To cope with possible endogeneity issues, we use exogenous weather shocks as our instrumental variables and find the empirical results are robust: network formation decisions are significantly affected by our proximity measures."

    "Abs": "Regional prejudice is prevalent in Chinese cities where native residents and migrants from other parts of China lack mutual trust. Weibo users actively discuss and argue about the issue of migration, which provides a good source of data to examine the communication network regarding regional prejudice. We are interested in the posts and reposts related to the topic on migrants. In a Weibo repost, one can add new content in addition to the original post. Then both original and new content as a whole can be read by others. In particular, we focus on the reposts in response to native residents' complaints about migrants. Based on the sentiment (negative or non-negative) and the direction (native resident -> migrant or migrant -> native resident), we classify the reposts into four categories. We find evidence of homophily in regional prejudice in the Weibo communication network: 72.7% of the time, native residents' complaints trigger more complaints from other native residents. What interests us most are the socioeconomic factors that can reverse the sentiment or direction of the original posts. A multinomial regression model of the reposting patterns reveals that in a city with better housing security and a larger migrant population, migrant Weibo users are much more likely to argue with native residents who hold a negative view about migrants. One important implication from our findings is that a secure socioeconomic environment facilitates the communication between migrants and native residents and helps break the self-reinforcing loop of regional prejudice."

The world's server logs are used to capture sociometrics about the users and their interaction.Findings - Findings suggest that personality and values influence the number of friends users make and the number of friendship requests users give out, but not the number of friendship invitations users receive. Only one personality trait - conscientiousness - exhibits homophily.Originality/value - Perosnality and social value orientation have rarely been studied together in information systems (IS) research, despite research showing the two have an impact on IS relevant constructs. The use of server logs for data capture is novel. Avatar friendship is an under-researched concept in IS."

    "Title": "Personality Homophily and the Local Network Characteristics of Facebook",
    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Social networks are known to form on the basis of homophily, where nodes with some type of similar characteristics are more likely to be connected. Some of the most fundamental human characteristics are reflected by an individual's personality, which represents a persistent disposition governing a human's outlook and approach to diverse situations. While taking into account demographics of age and gender, we assess the extent to which personality homophily is evident in the local network features of Facebook. Using a large sample obtained from the MyPersonality dataset, we find that a range of network-based features correlate with personality facets of individuals. In particular, extraversion had a positive effect on an individual's network size, while neuroticism had a negative effect. Additionally, extraversion and openness were positively related to transitivity, which was moderated by gender. Finally, we found that conscientiousness, agreeableness and extraversion were homophilous: people with higher similarity on these facets were more strongly connected. This was additionally mediated by gender for agreeableness: personality similarity had an effect for male-only and mixed pairs, but not for female-only pairs. Personality similarity was also stronger among closed triangles, compared to open ones. These results support the idea that inherent attraction between individuals, on the basis of personality, drives the roles we play within our online social networks."

    "Abs": "The advent of social networking and open health web forums such as PatientsLikeMe, WebMD, ehealth forum etc. have provided avenues for social user data that can prove instrumental in suggesting futuristic trends in healthcare. Homophily in social networks is a vital contributor for analyzing patterns for medical conditions, diagnosis and treatment options. Since, members with similar medical issues contribute to a common discussion pool; this offers a rich source of information that can be utilized. This paper intends to explore growing trends in Mental Health and Behavioral Studies (MHB) which lays emphasis on co-existing conditions resulting in comorbidity. We present a novel approach where personality traits inferred from unstructured text of patients and general social users are compared via statistical analysis. This is achieved by our Psychiatric Disorder Determination (PDD) algorithm. Further, Social media data of users showing personality traits of patients is subjected to semantic based text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Ontology Based Information Extraction (OBIE) in our Addiction Category Determination (ACD) algorithm. This provides categorization of user journals to common topics of discussion by referring to ontologies DBpedia, Freebase and YAGO2s. The final category hence obtained can be predicted to be a trending subject of concern for users with Psychiatric disorders developing Addictive behavioral personalities."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Summarizing patterns of connections or social ties in a social network, in terms of attributes information on nodes and edges, holds a key to the understanding of how the actors interact and form relationships. We formalize this problem as mining top-k group relationships (GRs), which captures strong social ties between groups of actors. While existing works focus on patterns that follow from the well known homophily principle, we are interested in social ties that do not follow from homophily, thus, provide new insights. Finding top-k GRs faces new challenges: it requires a novel ranking metric because traditional metrics favor patterns that are expected from the homophily principle; it requires an innovative search strategy since there is no obvious anti-monotonicity for such GRs; it requires a novel data structure to avoid data explosion caused by multidimensional nodes and edges and many-to-many relationships in a social network. We address these issues through presenting an efficient algorithm, GRMiner, for mining top-k GRs and we evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency using real data."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "We study the persistence of network segregation in networks characterized by the co-evolution of vertex attributes and link structures, in particular where individual vertices form linkages on the basis of similarity with other network vertices (homophily), and where vertex attributes diffuse across linkages, making connected vertices more similar over time (influence). A general mathematical model of these processes is used to examine the relative influence of homophily and influence in the maintenance and decay of network segregation in self-organizing networks. While prior work has shown that homophily is capable of producing strong network segregation when attributes are fixed, we show that adding even minute levels of influence is sufficient to overcome the tendency towards segregation even in the presence of relatively strong homophily processes. This result is proven mathematically for all large networks and illustrated through a series of computational simulations that account for additional network evolution processes. This research contributes to a better theoretical understanding of the conditions under which network segregation and related phenomenon-such as community structure-may emerge, which has implications for the design of interventions that may promote more efficient network structures."

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Ethnically diverse settings provide opportunities for interethnic friendship but can also increase the preference for same-ethnic friendship. Therefore, same-ethnic friendship preferences, or ethnic homophily, can work at cross-purposes with policy recommendations to diversify ethnic representation in social settings. In order to effectively overcome ethnic segregation, we need to identify those factors within diverse settings that exacerbate the tendency toward ethnic homophily. Using unique data and multiple network analyses, the authors examine 529 adolescent friendship networks in English, German, Dutch, and Swedish schools and find that the ethnic composition of school classes relates differently to immigrant and native homophily. Immigrant homophily disproportionately increases as immigrants see more same-ethnic peers, and friendship density among natives has no effect on this. By contrast, native homophily remains relatively low until natives see dense groups of immigrants. The authors' results suggest that theories of interethnic competition and contact opportunities apply differently to ethnic majority and minority groups."

Hypotheses predicted that individuals with high social anxiety would demonstrate greater interpersonal connectedness following instant messaging conversations; whereas, individuals with low social anxiety would report greater interpersonal connectedness following face-to-face and phone conversations. Undergraduate participants (N = 165) were randomly assigned to one of three conversation mediums (face-to-face, phone or instant messaging) during which they engaged in an interaction with an unfamiliar partner. Participants completed a measure of social anxiety before the interaction and measures of interpersonal connectedness prior to and following the interaction. Results revealed that level of social anxiety is a significant contingent condition for the association between type of conversation medium and attitude homophily (i.e., a measure of interpersonal connectedness). For individuals with low social anxiety, scores on the attitude homophily measure were significantly lower in the instant messaging condition, compared to the face-to-face and phone conditions.

Analyzing 3345 students within 158 German and Dutch school classes, we find that sharing a neighborhood provides additional meeting opportunities to become friends in class as adolescents are likely to befriend classmates who live nearby them or who live nearby a friend of them (propinquity mechanism). However, this hardly explains why adolescent friendship networks in school classes tend to be ethnically homogeneous. Also, we find no convincing evidence that an adolescent's preference for same-ethnic friends in class varies with the share of outgroup members in his/her neighborhood (exposure mechanism).

    "Year": 2016,
    "Abs": "Inconsistencies in the empirical support for balance theory are often explained by recourse to competing mechanisms that reduce the total degree of balance in the network. These mechanisms (such as differential popularity and subgroup hostility) may depend on exogenous properties of the nodes. This paper offers an alternative explanation for the departure of networks from global balance, according to which the myopic nature of sign adjustment in accordance with a pressure for local balance may reduce the global degree of balance and impede the formation of groups, whereas competing mechanisms that rely on exogenous node properties (e.g., homophily) facilitate these processes. The paper describes a set of simulations designed to study the evolution of complete signed networks under a local sign-change regime, induced by structural balance, homophily and heterophobia. Tolerance for local violation of balance and homophily is allowed to vary with a consequent impact upon the global degree of balance and group formation processes. We find the conditions under which the pressure towards local homophily and balance operate against each other culminating in a (locally) dynamic yet (globally) stationary state in which homophily adjusts towards group formation and balance undermines this process.

Student exchange flows were analysed for almost all Bologna Process member states and nonBologna OECD members over a ten-year period (from 2000 to 2009). We applied a Social Network Approach focusing on outbound diploma-mobility to identify positions of countries in the network of cross-national student exchange. Based on social network analyses, we first visualized the exchange patterns between sampled countries. In doing so, we analysed the student exchange linkages to gain descriptive insights into the development of the network (see Figure 1). Second, we used Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) to test which factors determine patterns of transnational student mobility. The results of this network analyses reveal that cross-national student exchange networks are stable over time. At the core of these networks are the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany; they attract the highest shares of students from the remaining countries in our sample. Moreover, the results of the ERGM demonstrate that homophily between countries determines student exchange patterns. The most relevant ties exist between bordering countries. Moreover, membership in the Bologna Process impacts on mobility patterns, and the effect size increases over the periods investigated."

Analyses of Chicago's neighborhood commuting network over twelve years (2002-2013) showed that violence predicted network isolation. Moreover, pairwise similarity in neighborhood violence predicted commuting ties, supporting homophily expectations. Violence homophily affected tie formation most, while neighborhood violence was important in dissolving ties. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Mass incarceration of young Black men has a significant impact on their network composition and stability that, in turn, may have major implications for health and well-being. A sub-group of young Black men with criminal justice involvement (CJI) identify as gay, bisexual or are non-identified men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM). This paper focuses on the potential effects of CJI on the composition of Black MSM social and sexual networks, their stability over time, and concomitant health and social outcomes. We use data from the UConnect study, a population-based cohort of young Black MSM 16-29 years of age (n = 618) selected using respondent -driven sampling in Chicago from 2013 to 2016. Both confidant and sexual network name generators and interpreters were administered at 9-month intervals over three waves of data collection. Ego and dyadic-level data were collected on behaviors prevalent among MSM and including factors associated with network CJI, network stability, and health outcomes. Generalized Structural Equation Models (GSEM) were utilized to determine the relationship between CJI network composition, network stability and behaviors prevalent among young Black MSM and their networks. In the UConnect cohort, 46% had at least once been detained, arrested or spent time in jail or prison. In addition, 20% of participants reported incident CJI over the study period. Respondents with a history of CJI were significantly more likely to have CJI homophily in their confidant and sexual networks. Multivariate analyses demonstrate that the association between one's history of CJI, housing instability and drug use is partially explained by one's network CJI. In addition, a higher prevalence of network CJI is associated with increased turnover in the confidant network, and this network instability is also related to important health and social outcomes. This analysis describes the networks of criminal justice involved men among a representative sample of young Black MSM and demonstrates the relationship between CJI network homophily, network stability and their impact on several key health and social outcomes relevant to this population.

Victimization increases the probability of continued co-offending, while the victimization of one's associates dissuade continued collaboration.

We find a weak subgroup structure dominated by two groups of \"old heads\" and characterized by moderate (non gang-based) race/ethnic clustering. Structurally, the network resembles adolescents in schools, suggesting that prison inmates are capable, of successfully building peer associations. We conclude that under the right conditions self-organizing inmate society can foster social integration reminiscent of other social settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "Abs": "Due to the experiential nature of travel-related products, online reviews have become an increasingly popular information source in travel planning and have a profound effect on consumers' buying decisions, particularly in hotel booking. On the basis of homophily and similarity-attraction theory, we posit that review valence is positively related to consumers' hotel booking intentions, and expect this relationship to be moderated by surface- (demographic) and deep-level (preference) similarities. The findings from two experiments conducted in Germany and Macau indicate that review valence significantly affects hotel booking intention, and that reader-reviewer demographic similarity moderates this effect. This three-way interaction reveals a substituting moderation effect between demographic similarity and preference similarity. One practical implication is that travel websites should find methods of exposing users to reviews written by those with either similar demographic characteristics or preferences, which facilitate travelers' decision-making processes.

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Using longitudinal data that we have collected on friendship and advice relations in a cohort of MBA students, we examine how status affects the dynamics of network ties among peers. Estimates of Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs) suggest that status is a consequence of network ties because over time the level of status attributed to individual students by other students tends to the average level of status attributed to their network partners-a phenomenon we call status assimilation. Status is also an antecedent to network ties because it affects partner selection decisions, giving rise to distinct forms of social attachment. We find that both network-based processes of status assimilation, as well as status-based processes of social selection, are present, but they vary subtly yet significantly across network domains. Students tend to the average level of status of their friends, but not to that of their advisors. High-status students are more active in the friendship network, but more popular in the advice network. We find evidence of performance homophily rather than status homophily: students with similar grades are more likely to exchange friendship and advice ties. High-status students tend to be more central in the advice network, but status attributions spill over through friendship, rather than advice relations. The study documents how the relation between social status and social networks varies both over time, as well as across network domains. The study also demonstrates the importance of accounting for multiplexity-the tendency of a network to operate through another."

In this article we examine the individuals who were the cultural workforce that comprised the Britpop' music scene of the 1990s. The focus of our analysis is homophily and heterophily to determine whether the clusters of friendships and working relationships of those who were best connected' in the scene were patterned by original social class position. We find that Britpop's whole network' is heterophilic but that its sub-networks' are more likely to be social class homophilic. The sub-networks that remain heterophilic are likely to be united by other common experiences that brought individuals in the network to the same social spaces. We suggest that our findings on Britpop might be generalised to the composition of other music scenes, cultural workforces and aggregations of young people. Our study differs from research on, first, British indie music' and social class which focuses upon the construction, representation and performance of social location rather than the relationships it might shape and second, the pioneering social network analyses of music scenes which currently lack explicit emphasis on social class."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Research problem: In the current information age, people are increasingly accustomed to sharing their special interests online and are influenced by the relationships developed from that sharing. The purpose of this study was to better measure peer influence in these online communities. Research questions: 1. How can peer influence in online communities be measured in a way that comprehensively incorporates peer-based characteristics, the homophily effect, and the structural position of a user in the network? 2. Is the method proposed in this study superior to other existing methods? Literature review: Previous literature on measuring online user influence can be classified into two streams: 1. Those that focus on the intrinsic characteristics of social media players to measure peer influence; 2. Those that address social network structure. Relevant computing algorithms include Topic-Based PageRank, Quality-Structure index, and so on. Although the first stream considers a focal peer's intrinsic characteristics, it overlooks the interpeer attraction in terms of similarity and discrepant knowledge among peers. The second stream mostly stresses the structures of social networks to measure network-wide peer influence but underestimates the effect of interpeer attraction that may leverage every diffusion step of peer influence through the network. To fill this research gap, this study proposes a new method of measuring network user influence that incorporates peers' intrinsic factors, interpeer influence factors as homophily effect, and network structure. Homophily refers to the degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are similar with respect to certain attributes. Methodology: From the communication sender-receiver perspective, we developed a computable method that incorporates peer-based characteristics, the homophily effect, and the structural position of a user in the network to measure the social network user influence. Two empirical studies were subsequently conducted in a social network service-based online community and an online professional logistics community to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results and conclusions: The empirical results show that our proposed method provides higher prediction accuracy of user influence rank in an online community than the other existing methods. These findings lay a foundation for future theoretical exploration and provide a useful tool for targeting influential users in online communities such as blogs, bulletin board systems, and forums."

    "Abs": "Social ties are strongly related to well-being. But what characterizes this relationship? This study investigates social mechanisms explaining how social ties affect well-being through social integration and social influence, and how well-being affects social ties through social selection. We hypothesize that highly integrated individuals-those with more extensive and dense friendship networks-report higher emotional well-being than others. Moreover, emotional well-being should be influenced by the well-being of close friends. Finally, wellbeing should affect friendship selection when individuals prefer others with higher levels of well-being, and others whose well-being is similar to theirs. We test our hypotheses using longitudinal social network and well-being data of 117 individuals living in a graduate housing community. The application of a novel extension of Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models for ordered networks (ordered SAOMs) allows us to detail and test our hypotheses for weak-and strong-tied friendship networks simultaneously. Results do not support our social integration and social influence hypotheses but provide evidence for selection: individuals with higher emotional well-being tend to have more strong-tied friends, and there are homophily processes regarding emotional well-being in strong-tied networks. Our study highlights the two-directional relationship between social ties and well-being, and demonstrates the importance of considering different tie strengths for various social processes."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Social media is becoming an increasingly common part of everyday life. Many social media sites (e.g. Facebook, Twitter and Linkedln) support new interpersonal interaction methods, some of which are neither directed nor reciprocated. For example, social media users can read online 'posts' (self-disclosures) of their friends without interacting with those friends. This is vastly different to traditional face-to-face communication. Our study investigated how reading online 'posts' affects relationship development. Using a longitudinal design sampling 243 participants, we focused on the effect of the posts' valence and intimacy. We found that high intimacy posts or negative posts decreased the social attractiveness of the self-discloser. The perception of the posts and the receiver's feelings of homophily to the self-discloser mediated this relationship. Studies of offline interpersonal interaction have found similar results. In offline communication, self-disclosure perception and homophily also mediate relationship outcomes. This suggests that reading posts on social media and interacting in real life trigger similar or identical relationship formation pathways. These results support the argument that passive consumption is a new method of interaction that does not fundamentally change human psychology. While novel, passive consumption is still based on the same principles as offline communication. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

    "Abs": "Social causality study on human action sequences is useful and important to improve our understandings to human behaviors on online social networks. The redundant indirect causalities and unobserved confounding factors, such as homophily and simultaneity phenomena, contribute to the huge challenges on accurate causal discovery on such human actions. A causal relationship exists between two persons, if the actions of one person are significantly affected by the actions of the other person, while fairly independent of her/his own prior actions. In this paper, we design a systematic approach based on conditional independence testing to detect such asymmetric relations, even when there are latent confounders underneath the observational action sequences. Technically, a group of asymmetric independence tests are conducted to infer the loose causal directions between action sequence pairs, followed by another group of tests to distinguish different types of relationships, e.g., homophily and simultaneity. Finally, a causal structure learning method is employed to output pairwise causalities with redundant indirect causalities eliminated. Empirical evaluations on simulated data verify the effectiveness and scalability of our proposals. We also present four interesting patterns of causal relations found by our algorithm, on real Sina Weibo feeds, including two new patterns never reported in previous studies."

Educational similarities might provide common ground whereas educational dissimilarity affects parents' authority to dispense advice. Using ordered logistic regression with data from the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (N = 2,444) parental advice and interest are modeled separately for mothers and fathers. Seemingly unrelated estimation is used to test for gender differences across models, revealing that mechanisms driving parental support differ by parents' gender. Fathers show more interest in adult children when they are educationally similar (consistent with the homophily hypothesis), but only among the highly educated, whereas mothers show more interest to highly educated children, regardless of their own level of educational attainment. Fathers' advice is conditioned on their own educational attainment whereas mothers give advice unconditionally (consistent with the gender hypothesis)."

    "Abs": "Scientists may encounter many collaborators of different academic ages throughout their careers. Thus, they are required to make essential decisions to commence or end a creative partnership. This process can be influenced by strategic motivations because young scholars are pursuers while senior scholars are normally attractors during new collaborative opportunities. While previous works have mainly focused on cross-sectional collaboration patterns, this work investigates scientific collaboration networks from scholars' local perspectives based on their academic ages. We aim to harness the power of big scholarly data to investigate scholars' academic-age-aware collaboration patterns. From more than 621,493 scholars and 2,646,941 collaboration records in Physics and Computer Science, we discover several interesting academic-age-aware behaviors. First, in a given time period, the academic age distribution follows the long-tail distribution, where more than 80% scholars are of young age. Second, with the increasing of academic age, the degree centrality of scholars goes up accordingly, which means that senior scholars tend to have more collaborators. Third, based on the collaboration frequency and distribution between scholars of different academic ages, we observe an obvious homophily phenomenon in scientific collaborations. Fourth, the scientific collaboration triads are mostly consisted with beginning scholars. Furthermore, the differences in collaboration patterns between these two fields in terms of academic age are discussed."

    "Title": "Beyond interviewer effects in the standardized measurement of ego-centric networks",
    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "The effects which interviewers exert on the collection of ego-centric networks have recently come into the focus of methodological considerations. Studies consistently show that the size of networks varies depending on the interviewer. We would like to expand on this research strand by pointing to different aspects which have so far gone unremarked in the discussion. First, size is mainly analysed as a network measure which is influenced during data collection, while other common measures such as network density or composition have not received sufficient consideration. Second, large-scale surveys using face-to-face interviews usually allocate interviewers to a single sampling point. Differences between sampling points (locality effects) are attributed to interviewer effects. Hence, we disentangle the effects of the locality and interviewer. Third, the discussion on interviewer effects often follows an \"actor-oriented\" consideration of how data collection situations are structured by interviewers. Expanding this approach from a relational perspective, we consider the relationship between the interviewers and respondents and whether this relationship influences the collection of network data. To test our hypotheses about the influence of interviewers, the locality and the interviewer-respondent relationship on different network measures, we use data from the 2010 German General Social Survey (n = 2827 respondents, n = 220 interviewers). The multilevel analyses show that the relationship between the interviewer and the respondent is not very relevant. Furthermore, the analyses show that interviewers have an influence on the network size but not on measures of their composition. However, evidence on the prevalence of locality or interviewer effects is mixed. Finally, homophilous interviewer-respondent relationships have very little effect on network characteristics. We find evidence of training and fatigue effects on network size. However, much of the variation in network size caused by the interviewer still remains unexplained. We draw conclusions on how to organize interview situations in surveys. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "Title": "Responsiveness of Mining Community Acceptance Model to Key Parameter Changes",
    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "The mining industry has difficulties predicting changes in the level of community acceptance of its projects over time. These changes are due to changes in the society and individual perceptions around these mines as a result of the mines' environmental and social impacts. Agent-based modeling can be used to facilitate better understanding of how community acceptance changes with changing mine environmental impacts. This work investigates the sensitivity of an agent-based model (ABM) for predicting changes in community acceptance of a mining project due to information diffusion to key input parameters. Specifically, this study investigates the responsiveness of the ABM to average degree (total number of friends) of the social network, close neighbour ratio (a measure of homophily in the social network) and number of early adopters (\"innovators\"). A two-level full factorial experiment was used to investigate the sensitivity of the model to these parameters. The primary (main), secondary and tertiary effects of each parameter were estimated to assess the model's sensitivity. The results show that the model is more responsive to close neighbour ratio and number of early adopters than average degree. Consequently, uncertainty surrounding the inferences drawn from simulation experiments using the agent-based model will be minimized by obtaining more reliable estimates of close neighbour ratio and number of early adopters. While it is possible to reliably estimate the level of early adopters from the literature, the degree of homophily (close neighbour ratio) has to be estimated from surveys that can be expensive and unreliable. Further, work is required to find economic ways to document relevant degrees of homophily in social networks in mining communities."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Understanding the emergence of strong controversial issues in modern societies is a key issue in opinion studies. A commonly diffused idea is the fact that the increasing of homophily in social networks, due to the modern ICT, can be a driving force for opinion polarization. In this paper we address the problem with a modelling approach following three basic steps. We first introduce a network morphogenesis model to reconstruct network structures where homophily can be tuned with a parameter. We show that as homophily increases the emergence of marked topological community structures in the networks raises. Secondly, we perform an opinion dynamics process on homophily dependent networks and we show that, contrary to the common idea, homophily helps consensus formation. Finally, we introduce a tunable external media pressure and we show that, actually, the combination of homophily and media makes the media effect less effective and leads to strongly polarized opinion clusters."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Most research on segregation in social networks considers small circles of strong ties, and little is known about segregation among the much larger number of weaker ties. This article proposes a novel approach to the study of these more extended networks, through the use of data on personal ties in an online social network. We illustrate this method's potential by describing and explaining the degree of ethnic and gender segregation on Facebook among a representative survey of adolescents in the Netherlands (N = 2,810; similar to 1.1 million Facebook friends). The results show that large online networks are more strongly segregated by ethnicity than by gender. Drawing on the same survey data, we find that core networks are more segregated in terms of ethnicity and gender than are extended networks. However, an exception to this pattern is personal networks of ethnic majority members, whose core networks are as segregated by ethnicity as their extended networks. Further analysis suggests this exception is due to their larger population size and the ethnic segregation of their social settings. We discuss the implications of these findings for the role of structural opportunities, homophily, and balance."

It investigates whether the Catholic and Leftist affiliation of organizations impacts in the city of Turin (Italy) and Kielce (Poland). Applying different social network analysis techniques, the article finds that in both cities there is a tendency towards preferring similar partners. However, while the influence of affiliation is relevant to predict the access to policy making in Turin, in Kielce, this influence is mediated by the actor's centrality in the social sphere. In both cities, networks are characterized by the higher centrality of Catholic organizations, which also translate in a greater involvement in the political sphere. Twenty-five years after the end of the cold war, past-affiliation is still a strong predictor of political involvement and impacts on the shape of local governance structure."

We derive several results on the formation of links in such networks, including results on the degree distribution, on comparative statics relating degree and group size, and on the dynamics of homophily. In particular, we derive comparative statics showing that degree is typically positively related to social group size but negatively related to the size of the overlap across multiple social groups. This is supported by evidence from a Facebook dataset. We also show that homophily over an agent's lifespan in the network can be non-monotonic, reaching a global maximum in some period before eventually decreasing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Employing a qualitative multiple case study method, I show that grants are awarded via interpersonal networks, a meso-level finding that suggests a second, macro-level research question: how are interpersonal networks institutionalized in this context? In my analysis, I contribute to a theoretical understanding of the recursive relationship between networks and institutions: I show how macro-level institutional practices and forms emerge from networks, and how the micro-level character of the network participants themselves ultimately shapes institutional forms. Combined, my results provide a mechanistic, multi-level understanding of the relationship between networks and institutions, as well as of how homophily operates in grantmaking. Because of the potential for social stratification and exclusion based on the structure of the network itself, I argue that such networks should be understood as \"allocative failures.''"

Particularly for white middle-classes in gentrified neighbourhoods, there is evidence on boundary drawing to ` unwanted groups' such as ethnic minorities and lower-classes. Rarely have these studies focused on the networks of ethnic minorities, the actual diversity-bringers. I will contribute to the understanding of why and under what circumstances diversity in neighbourhoods gets translated into people's daily practices, hence also networks, by analysing those of middle-class TurkishGermans in Berlin. Based on interviews and network analysis, I will show that a neighbourhood's ethnic diversity, fellow residents' attitudes towards diversity and the built environment play an important role in building category-crossing ties. Owing to a lack of reciprocity in establishing ties, Turkish-Germans in neighbourhoods with a high share of native-Germans actually have more ties to Turks than those in a more diverse neighbourhood."

Using two waves of full network data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and dynamic longitudinal network SIENA models, we find (1) that both selection and influence impact network-religion autocorrelation; (2) that the factors influencing network-religion autocorrelation vary across school contexts; and (3) that religious influence is proportional to the number of friends in an adolescent's network, which means influence reflects both the size of an individual's network and the consistency of religion among members of the network. We conclude by addressing potential reasons for differences across school contexts and by discussing the theoretical logic behind the total similarity effect that best operationalized religious influence."

    "Abs": "In contemporary Western Europe, both scholars and the public discuss the consequences of a rising share of a comparatively religious Muslim population for societal coexistence. Yet we know surprisingly little about how religion and religiosity shape social relationships. Focusing on adolescents' friendship networks, we examine how religion and religiosity affect intra-and inter-group friendship choices. While youth should generally prefer to befriend peers of the same religion, this religious homophily should be more pronounced for highly than for less religious youth. Against the background of rising anti-Muslim attitudes in Europe, Christian and non-religious youth further may be particularly hesitant to befriend Muslim peers, and especially highly religious ones. We analysed three waves of German longitudinal friendship network data from ethnically diverse schools. Regarding intra-group friendships, while Muslim youth indeed preferred to befriend Muslim peers, Christian youth displayed no evidence of religious homophily. For Muslims, higher levels of religiosity further increased this preference. Regarding inter-group friendships, irrespective of their individual religiosity, Muslim youth were socially divided from their non-Muslim peers, as both Christian and nonreligious youth were reluctant to befriend Muslim peers. In sum, in the German context, religion itself rather than religiosity seems to matter most for adolescents' friendship choices."

    "Abs": "The rhetoric of \"excellence\" is pervasive across the academy. It is used to refer to research outputs as well as researchers, theory and education, individuals and organizations, from art history to zoology. But does \"excellence\" actually mean anything? Does this pervasive narrative of \"excellence\" do any good? Drawing on a range of sources we interrogate \"excellence\" as a concept and find that it has no intrinsic meaning in academia. Rather it functions as a linguistic interchange mechanism. To investigate whether this linguistic function is useful we examine how the rhetoric of excellence combines with narratives of scarcity and competition to show that the hyper-competition that arises from the performance of \"excellence\" is completely at odds with the qualities of good research. We trace the roots of issues in reproducibility, fraud, and homophily to this rhetoric. But we also show that this rhetoric is an internal, and not primarily an external, imposition. We conclude by proposing an alternative rhetoric based on soundness and capacity-building. In the final analysis, it turns out that that \"excellence\" is not excellent. Used in its current unqualified form it is a pernicious and dangerous rhetoric that undermines the very foundations of good research and scholarship.

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "This paper examines tourists' knowledge sharing behavior in social media. Based on social capital theory, we aim to examine the effects of three dimensions of social capital-structural (social interaction ties), cognitive (shared vision) and relational (trust)-for two different types of social media: Facebook and TripAdvisor. We propose a structural model that connects an antecedent (homophily) and a consequence (knowledge sharing through posting) of these main dimensions of social capital. An online survey is conducted with 1200 Spanish consumers. Based on the full sample, our structural equation modeling supports most of the hypothesized paths, while trust does not affect either social interaction ties or knowledge sharing. Examining the difference between Facebook and TripAdvisor, our multigroup analysis finds that neither trust nor shared vision drives knowledge sharing on TripAdvisor, while shared vision affects knowledge sharing in Facebook. In both media, social interaction ties play an important role in motivating users to post comments. The effects of homophily on social interaction ties and on shared vision were statistically greater in TripAdvisor than in Facebook. Homophily did not affect trust in either media. In closing, both theoretical and managerial implications are discussed, important limitations are recognized and future research directions are suggested. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Results indicate that response to the commercial was cognitive in nature with perceived homophily, sympathy, beliefs and attitude toward the ad partially mediating the influence of perceived verisimilitude on attitude toward the brand. Unexpectedly, empathy did not play a mediating role. Possible reasons for this, including cultural factors, are discussed. The results also suggest that to effectively promote tourism services a commercial's production value and realism must be high to produce sufficient verisimilitude. In addition, the behavior and appearance of the actors chosen for the commercial should match those of the intended target audience in order to produce sufficient homophily."

Staying consistent with homophily or ingroup preference theories, we find that domestic tourists contribute more to the happiness of locals than foreign tourists. Also by staying consistent with Irridex theory, we find that tourism at low levels of development contributes more to happiness than tourism at a high level of development."

    "Abs": "As far as social networks are concerned, new applications appear to analyze them. Community detection is one of the most important issues. It allows to understand the structure of complex networks and to extract useful information from the detected communities. Users have usually a social interaction with their friends because of their common interests or their similar profiles. In this paper, attributed graphs are considered, where entities of the network are described using attributes with several modalities. Then, we propose an hybrid approach based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) for community detection in social network with node attributes. This method, called ACDC (Attributed Community Detection based on Concepts), combines the structure of the network and the attributes of the nodes. ACDC, semantically and statically, partitions an assigned graph into k densely connected communities, using maximal cliques, with homogeneous attribute values derived from FCA. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACDC through comparison with the state-of-the-art graph clustering and methods. Our method provides also more meaningful communities than conventional methods that consider only relationship information."

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Link prediction is an important and interesting application for social networks because it can infer potential links among network participants. Existing approaches basically work with the homophily principle, i.e., people of similar characteristics tend to befriend each other. In this way, however, they are not suitable for inferring negative links or hostile links, which usually take place among people with different characteristics. Moreover, negative links tend to couple with positive links to form signed networks. In this paper, we thus study the problem of disentangled link prediction (DLP) for signed networks, which includes two separate tasks, i.e., inferring positive links and inferring negative links. Recently, representation learning methods have been proposed to solve the link prediction problem because the entire network structure can be encoded in representations. For the DLP problem, we thus propose to disentangle a node representation into two representations, and use one for positive link prediction and another for negative link prediction. Experiments on three real-world signed networks demonstrate the proposed disentangled representation learning (DRL) method significantly outperforms alternatives in the DLP problem."

The application of network discovery of relevant content is considered using an approach that may be generalized to a broad class of vertex properties. The resulting procedure provides the initial step of a graph analytic processing chain whose performance is directly affected by the quality of graph sampling. The performance of the algorithm is measured with real network data and content observed on a social media site. Precision-Recall performance improvements of 30% are demonstrated with this dataset, compared to a baseline approach that does not exploit homophily. Because real-world graphs grow exponentially, this performance improvement may have a significant impact on graph analytic algorithms with sensitivities to the graph sampling quality."

Here, we analyze 12 different name generators used in a sociocentric network study conducted in 75 villages in rural Karnataka, India. Having unusual sociocentric data from a non-Western context allowed us to extend previous name generator research through the unique analyses of network structural measures, an extensive consideration of homophily, and investigation of status difference between egos and alters. We found that domestic interaction questions generated networks that were highly clustered and highly centralized. Similarity between respondents and their nominated contacts was strongest for gender, caste, and religion. We also found that domestic interaction name generators yielded the most homogeneous ties, while advice questions yielded the most heterogeneous. Participants were generally more likely to nominate those of higher social status, although certain questions, such as who participants talk to uncovered more egalitarian relationships, while other name generators elicited the names of social contacts distinctly higher or lower in status than the respondent. Some questions also seemed to uncover networks that were specific to the cultural context, suggesting that network researchers should balance local relevance with global generalizability when choosing name generators.

Due to the nature of these platforms, specifically Twitter, users can express their ideas in the way they prefer no matter if it is racist or not. As the Twitter CEO says, one of the most difficult things for them is to detect and ban people who harass others. Researches have addressed this issue in recent years. However, it is needed a wider range of strategies to detect racist users and content. In this work, we collect tweets produced by the ego networks of the two former 2016 US Presidential Candidates: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, grouped in four datasets. After deleting spammers, we get 84,371 unique users labeled by using two different metrics: Sentiment Word Count and Racist Score. Both of them let us not only to identify users as racists, but also to detect the level of negativism by analyzing their most recent 200 tweets, increasing the effectiveness of the method. Using it, we find the most negative and racist user and the most positive and non-racist user from all datasets. Taking advantage of the topological properties of the ego networks we analyzed, we also verify that our results satisfy the sociologist theory of homophily; where the followers of each candidate represent their homophilous. For a nation as the United States of America, detecting online harassers might help to decrease racism and cyberbullying, social problems that affect their society. A world without online harassers is an utopia, but this is one step to achieve it."

The study uses a Facebook API to help participants pick five Facebook friends to act as their favorite sources for advice on shopping.Findings-The results suggest that consumers' deal evaluations (as shaped by the recency effects of previous exposure to prices and the influence of Facebook friends and C2C websites) have carry-over effects on their eWOM intentions. The influence of Facebook friends and C2C websites on deal evaluation is as powerful as that of reference price, especially concerning the mean and the lowest prices.Practical implications-The findings encourage marketers to invest their resources in targeting online groups, and suggest that C2C website marketers should set their offer prices between the mean and the lowest prices.Originality/value-This study extends prior research on the motives for eWOM dissemination and elaborates an approach to initiate eWOM intention through deal evaluation."

    "Abs": "Missing data is an important, but often ignored, aspect of a network study. Measurement validity is affected by missing data, but the level of bias can be difficult to gauge. Here, we describe the effect of missing data on network measurement across widely different circumstances. In Part I of this study (Smith and Moody, 2013), we explored the effect of measurement bias due to randomly missing nodes. Here, we drop the assumption that data are missing at random: what happens to estimates of key network statistics when central nodes are more/less likely to be missing? We answer this question using a wide range of empirical networks and network measures. We find that bias is worse when more central nodes are missing. With respect to network measures, Bonacich centrality is highly sensitive to the loss of central nodes, while closeness centrality is not; distance and bicomponent size are more affected than triad summary measures and behavioral homophily is more robust than degree-homophily. With respect to types of networks, larger, directed networks tend to be more robust, but the relation is weak. We end the paper with a practical application, showing how researchers can use our results (translated into a publically available java application) to gauge the bias in their own data.

    "Abs": "Theorising of negative ties has focused on simplex negative tie networks or multiplex signed tie networks. We examine the fundamental differences between positive and negative tie networks measured on the same set of actors. We test six mechanisms of tie formation on face-to-face positive (affect/esteem) and negative (dislike/disesteem) networks of 282 university students. While popularity, activity, and entrainment are present in both networks, closure, reciprocity, and homophily are largely absent from negative tie networks. We argue this arises because avoidance is inherent to negative sentiments. Avoidance reduces information transfer through negative ties and short-circuits cumulative causation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "Exponential random models have been widely adopted as a general probabilistic framework for complex networks and recently extended to embrace broader statistical settings such as dynamic networks, valued networks or two-mode networks. Our aim is to provide a further step into the generalization of this class of models by considering sample spaces which involve both families of networks and nodal properties verifying combinatorial constraints. We propose a class of probabilistic models for the joint distribution of nodal properties (demographic and behavioral characteristics) and network structures (friendship and professional partnership). It results in a general and flexible modeling framework to account for homophily in social structures. We present a Bayesian estimation method based on the full characterization of their sample spaces by systems of linear constraints. This provides an exact simulation scheme to sample from the likelihood, based on linear programming techniques. After a detailed analysis of the proposed statistical methodology, we illustrate our approach with an empirical analysis of co-authorship of journal articles in the field of neuroscience between 2009 and 2013.

    "Year": 2017,
    "Abs": "This paper establishes the power of dynamic collaborative task completion among workers for urban mobile crowd-sourcing. Collaboration is defined via the notion of peer referrals, whereby a worker who has accepted a location-specific task, but is unlikely to visit that location, offloads the task to a willing friend. Such a collaborative framework might be particularly useful for task bundles, especially for bundles that have higher geographic dispersion. The challenge, however, comes from the high similarity observed in the spatio-temporal pattern of task completion among friends. Using extensive real-world crowd-sourcing studies conducted over 7 weeks and 1000+ workers on a campus-based crowd-sourcing platform, we quantify the effect of such \"task completion homophily\", and show that incorporating such peer-preferences can improve worker-specific models of task preferences by over 30%. We then show that such collaborative offloading works in spite of such spatio-temporal similarity, primarily because workers refer tasks to their close friends, who in turn perform such peer-requested tasks (with over 95% completion rate) even if they experience detours that are significantly larger (often more than twice) than what they normally tolerate for platform-recommended tasks."

Though our literature has long championed leisure for its public sphere effects, little research has examined its actual impact. To generate interest in this line of inquiry, I discuss the value of everyday cross-talk for democratic citizenship and consider the role leisure possibly plays in its advancement. Evidence is reported from the few studies outside of our field that focus on casual political talk in seemingly nonpolitical environments and activities. Finally, potential reactions to political talk in leisure contexts and the outcome(s) of such talk are explored. The article ends with questions posed to offer guidance for future research."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "During the last ten years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have increased their popularity by becoming part of the real life of users. Despite their tremendous widespread, OSNs have introduced several privacy issues as a consequence of the nature of the information involved in these services. Indeed, the huge amount of private information produced by users of current OSNs expose the users to a number of risks. The analysis of the users' similarity in OSNs is attracting the attention of researchers because of its implications on privacy and social marketing. In particular, the homophily between users could be used to reveal important characteristics that users would like to keep hidden, hence violating the privacy of OSNs' users. Homophily has been well studied in existing sociology literature, however, it is not easily extensible in OSNs due to the lack of real datasets. In this paper, we propose an analysis of similarity of social profiles in terms of movie preferences. Results reveal the presence of homophily between users and its dependence from the tie strength. Moreover, we show that it is possible to profile a user (in our case by considering the age attribute) by exploiting movie preferences."

    "Abs": "Though religion matters greatly to many U.S. adults, it is widely considered a touchy conversational topic. Understanding how religious issues are talked about with others can elucidate a key interpersonal manifestation of Americans' faith, yet existing research has largely overlooked the phenomena of religious discussion in social networks. This article considers which types of people talk about religion with their close ties, what relational factors underlie religious discussion, and what implications such discussion has for network turnover and stability. Applying multilevel regression methods to ego-centered networks measured in the Portraits of American Life Survey, I find that individual-and relational-level factors each predict the presence of religious discussion within close networks. Longitudinal analyses further reveal that for a large subset of Americans-namely evangelical and mainline Protestants and those involved in a congregation-religious discussion partners are especially likely to remain in the network over the course of 6 years. This association extended beyond other factors that could explain tie persistence, including relational closeness and multiple forms of homophily. Results point to several promising future directions for the study of religion and social networks."

    "Abs": "Successful performance by tour guides depends highly on their networking activities and interpersonal skills. Membership in related associations can provide opportunities for establishing and expanding a supportive network in the tour guiding profession. This study explores communication ecosystems used among the members of the largest professional tour guides organization, the World Federation of Tourist Guide Associations (WFTGA). Using the data collected from the 17th WFTGA convention in Tehran, Iran, we investigated five types of tour guides' communications ecosystems (i.e.in-person, online-call, text-message, e-mail, and social networks) and compared them to tour guides' networks of colleagues (i.e., the network that shows how people know one another and how they are linked). Moreover, we included the complementary no-contact network to enhance the internal validity of the study. Using exponential random graph modeling, all seven networks have been modeled using demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education, marital status, and tenure along with the history of participation in previous WFTGA conventions and WFTGA membership status. The analyses of virtual/digital (i.e., online-call, text-message, e-mail, and online social networks) and natural/traditional (i.e., in-person) communication ecosystems showed interesting similarities and differences among the seven networks, providing valuable insights for practitioners as well as academicians. Findings revealed the formation of networks based on homophily as well as heterophily effects is a function of types of communication ecosystem."

The hypotheses are tested with data from the Bavarian Graduate Panel via fixed-effect panel regressions. Results show that relative group sizes must be considered in order to see wage differences. These wage benefits emerge in minority and majority groups for male academics, but women earn less in majority groups when their supervisor is of the same sex."

    "Abs": "Homophily, ranging from demographics to sentiments, breeds connections in social networks, either offline or online. However, with the prosperous growth of music streaming services, whether homophily exists in online music listening remains unclear. In this study, two online social networks of the same group of active users who listened to complete songs over 1000 times and posted over 100 tweets are established, separately, in Netease Music and Weibo. Through presented multiple similarity measures, it is evidently demonstrated that homophily does exist in music listening for both online social networks. The unexpected listening similarity in Weibo also implies that knowledge from generic social networks can be confidently transferred to domain-oriented networks for context enrichment and algorithm enhancement. Comprehensive factors that might function in the formation of homophily are further probed, and many interesting patterns are profoundly revealed. It is found that female friends are more homogeneous in music listening and that positive and energetic songs significantly pull users close. Our methodology and findings shed light on realistic applications in online music services."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Different social processes give rise to network structures with distinctive properties. In this paper our goal is to identify the social processes that give rise to distinct network structures (specifically, subgroups). We examine particular structural meta-relations by identifying the properties of individuals associated with specific subgroups. Clues to the process of group formation and the context in which these groups form and persist may be extracted from the properties of individuals in those groups. Following this intuition, we propose a general technique for identifying systematic patterns of attribute occupancy to determine how individual attributes may drive group formation. To connect the social context in which groups form to their structural signatures, we relate subgroup composition to nodal attributes. We illustrate the utility of comparing subgroup (e.g., clique, n-clique, k-core, etc.) co-membership with nodal co-membership in a variety of attributes. The correlations between these two co-membership matrices illustrate clearly the strength of association between shared attributes and shared subgraph membership. Furthermore, examining these correlations across groups of different sizes indicates where these attributes are most strongly associated with group co-membership. Additionally, these correlations fit well into a QAP framework to determine where shared subgraph membership has a stronger (or weaker) relation to shared attribute membership than we would expect by chance. We demonstrate the technique with a series of large, online friendship networks on the order of thousands of nodes to illustrate how factors such as gender, cohort, residence, and other attributes are associated with co-membership across a range of clique sizes.

We combine these factors as explanatory variables in different exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to assess the relative strength of prestige and homophily for the actors' link formation. We analyze the climate change discourse in a hyperlink network formed by US civil society actors from November 2014 and test how relevant the different factors are, including variables such as actor type, country, position, and topic. We find that both prestige and various aspects of homophily influence link formation online.

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Comprehensive and quantitative investigations of social theories and phenomena increasingly benefit from the vast breadth of data describing human social relations that is now available within the realm of computational social science. Such data are, however, typically proxies for one of the many interaction layers composing social networks, which can be defined in many ways and are composed of communication of various types (e.g., phone calls, face-to-face communication, etc.). As a result, many studies focus on one single layer, corresponding to the data at hand. Several studies have however shown that these layers are not interchangeable, despite the presence of a certain level of correlation between them. Here, we investigate whether different layers of interactions among individuals lead to similar conclusions with respect to the presence of homophily patterns in a population-homophily represents one of the widest studied phenomenon in social networks. To this aim, we consider a data set describing interactions and links of various nature in a population of Asian students with diverse nationalities, first language and gender. We study homophily patterns, as well as their temporal evolution in each layer of the social network. To facilitate our analysis, we put forward a general method to assess whether the homophily patterns observed in one layer inform us about patterns in another layer. For instance, our study reveals that three network layers-cell phone communications, questionnaires about friendship, and trust relations-lead to similar and consistent results despite some minor discrepancies. The homophily patterns of the co-presence network layer, however, does not yield any meaningful information about other network layers."

To concentrate on the main source and destination markets for each country, only its top k inbound and outbound flows are considered. The distribution of these most important ties in international tourism seems to be scale-free, with some occurrence of reciprocity, large transitivity, and high-degree centralization. The GTN shows a clustered structure determined by geographical as well as trade and cultural factors. Each major global and regional power seems to have a certain tourism sphere of influence. The network has a small world character and a high degree of geographic homophily, with more links within continents than between continents. Exponential random graph models have been fit to explain the observed global structure of the network based on its local interactions, and a number of significant motifs have been identified. The picture that results is a GTN that emerges from superimposed local processes in which tourism flows between countries is determined from multiple independent individual decisions made at the local level. This insight that global tourism patterns are driven by local processes is a major contribution of this research and can help develop strategic plans and cooperation partnerships at the national and regional levels, involving private and public stakeholders and targeting specific source and destination markets. The indicators computed using network analysis of global tourism flows can also be used to complement and enrich the information provided by current tourism statistics."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Despite the strategic role played by individuals, who act as intermediaries between distinct groups of people, the problem of recommending diverse friends in signed social networks (SSNs) still remains largely unexplored. Our model integrates homophily and diversity to develop an adaptive consensus based framework, which involves fuzzy group decision making analysis by leveraging on the signed social links and underlying users' preferences, to offer lists of connections which are diverse as well as relevant. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we modeled the fuzzy binary adjacency relations between users, thereafter referred as decision makers (DMs), exploiting users' preferences conferred on a set of items, and then higher order fuzzy m-ary adjacency relations are constructed to represent the grade of agreement between a set of m DMs. Further, in order to evaluate the relevance of each decision maker involved in the decision making process, we introduce a novel diversity measure based on the knowledge of socio-psychological theories and the information contained in social and interest links. Next, by employing variable-length genetic algorithm, an idea of adaptive consensus is explored to evolve groups of experts which are highly consensual as well as influential in the social network. Finally, on the basis of opinions gleaned from the members of these groups, sign of unknown links are predicted, thereby generating a top-N recommendations list of diverse friends. Extensive experimental study conducted on Epinions dataset illustrates that our proposed scheme outperforms the traditional graph-based methods."

    "Abs": "We examined social mechanisms that account for similarity in the social context of school-sponsored extracurricular sports activities among friends. We distinguish two social mechanisms: \"shared sports activities that lead to friendship,\" whereby friendship formation and maintenance are conditioned by joint sports participation, and \"friendship that leads to shared sports activities,\" a form of social influence whereby adolescents join or maintain certain sports activities based on their friends' choices. Using a longitudinal sample of 1,776 10th graders at five high schools in Southern California, we employed a stochastic actor-oriented multivariate dynamic model to model the dynamic interplay between the two-mode affiliation network of adolescents' participation in sports activities and the one-mode friendship network. As a corresponding descriptive method, we propose a quantitative measure for the relative strength of the two-mentioned mechanisms as explanations of the association between the one-mode and the two-mode network. Further, we introduce two specifications that represent homophily effects in the two-mode network and apply them to test gender homophily in sports participation. The results provide strong evidence for both mechanisms, with friendship leading to shared sport activities as stronger than shared sports activities leading to friendships in explaining adolescents' friendships with co-participants."

Then we explore if like-minded people (homophily) live together and examine heterogeneity within their households. To do this we analyze attitudinal data using multilevel latent class clustering that allows identification of groups of persons and groups of households jointly. Our analysis identifies distinct groups of people with different attitudes towards modes and we do not find strong homophily in attitudes within households. The distinction of attitudes among persons transfers well to the household level giving us the opportunity to identify and test differences among the different attitudinal groups using longitudinal records. We then move to a longitudinal analysis using a small sample of households that participated in more than ten years of the Puget Sound panel survey to explore the sequence of their residential location characteristics, car ownership, and travel. We find in descriptive statistics and in a second application of multilevel cluster models that carpool and transit loyalty persists over time by a portion of car pool and transit lovers. We also find sustained use of cars by car loving households, sustained car use of a neutral in attitudes group, a group of younger households with positive attitudes towards carsharing and sustained car sharing over time, and a possibly disenfranchised older household group lacking access to opportunities. The inclusion in the analysis of the two residential location characteristics (evolution of density and diversity around the household residence) enabled a more complete analysis and a clearer description of household context for both attitudes and behavior."

Going beyond this literature, I incorporate contemporary racial stratification literature and propose integration into white congregations would vary by racial group as a result of the differing symbolic group positioning of minorities in America's racial hierarchy. Results from multilevel models using a national dataset generally support my hypotheses. The findings from this study reveal distinctions between minority racial groups within predominantly white congregations. Thus, the homophily principle and organizational ecology are not sufficient when studying race within congregations, as it is not enough to rely solely on the numeric representation of racial groups in congregations without taking into account the social positioning of these groups. These results, their implications, and potential directions for future studies are further discussed."

When two actors have conflicting reports about each other, how do we establish which of the two (if any) deserves our trust? In this paper, we model this scenario as a network problem: actors are nodes in a network and their reports about each other are the edges of the network. To estimate their trustworthiness levels, we develop an iterative framework which looks at all the reports about each connected actor pair to define its trustworthiness balance. We apply this framework to a customer/supplier business network. We show that our trustworthiness score is a significant predictor of the likelihood a business will pay a fine if audited. We show that the market network is characterized by homophily: businesses tend to connect to partners with similar trustworthiness degrees. This suggests that the topology of the network influences the behavior of the actors composing it, indicating that market regulatory efforts should take into account network theory to prevent further degeneration and failures.

    "Abs": "Contagion effects, also known as peer effects or social influence process, have become more and more central to social science, especially with the availability of longitudinal social network data. However, contagion effects are usually difficult to identify, as they are often entangled with other factors, such as homophily in the selection process, the individual's preference for the same social settings, etc. Methods currently available either do not solve these problems or require strong assumptions. Following Shalizi and Thomas (2011), I frame this difficulty as an omitted variable bias problem, and I propose several alternative estimation methods that have potentials to correctly identify contagion effects when there is an unobserved trait that co-determines the influence and the selection. The Monte-Carlo simulation results suggest that a latent-space adjusted estimator is especially promising. It outperforms other estimators that are traditionally used to deal with the unobserved variables, including a structural equation based estimator and an instrumental variable estimator.

Here, we study the academic performance among a cohort of 538 undergraduate students forming a single, densely connected social network. Our work is based on data collected using smartphones, which the students used as their primary phones for two years. The availability of multi-channel data from a single population allows us to directly compare the explanatory power of individual and social characteristics. We find that the most informative indicators of performance are based on social ties and that network indicators result in better model performance than individual characteristics (including both personality and class attendance). We confirm earlier findings that class attendance is the most important predictor among individual characteristics. Finally, our results suggest the presence of strong homophily and/or peer effects among university students."

We characterize the networks in terms of the basic structural properties. In particular, we focus on the k-cores and the presence of transitive triangles. Clustering in the networks is found to result from homophily by language and religious affiliations. The large network fragments appear to be small-worlds. We also compare the fragments in the kin network with respect to the average coefficient of relationship. The measures of assortativity are able to distinguish the families in terms of their regions of origin. Overall, we distinguish between two patterns of regional effects, the 'metropolitan' and the 'cultural' pattern."

This study proposes and empirically tests an integrative model of three social network constructs associated with the website (i.e., tie strength, homophily, and source credibility) and their relationship to consumers' evaluations associated with attitudes and perceived influence of eWOM effectiveness. An online survey with a sample size of 793 respondents revealed that the homophily and tie strength between a website and a consumer are important drivers of source credibility, which in turn influence attitude toward the reviews as well as the website. The attitudes formed through the perceptions of tie-strength, homophily and source credibility ultimately determines the influence of eWOM consumers' purchase decisions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Abs": "Latinos are the largest ethnoracial minority group in America, and Latino congregations play an important role in the lives of their members and communities. Yet, little research exists on these congregations. The current study provides an examination of the lay leadership structures and power dynamics within Latino congregations. Drawing from organizational ecology theory and the homophily principle as well as contemporary racial stratification literature, we propose competing hypotheses regarding the roles whites play within the lay leadership and power structures of Latino congregations. Utilizing a national multilevel data set, we find the persistence of white privilege existing within Latino congregations, as whites are more likely to hold lay leadership positions within these congregations than Latinos, despite their numeric minority status. Moreover, our results reveal that individual access to the decision-making process in these congregations increases for both whites and multiracial individuals as the proportion of Latinos increases in their congregation. We further discuss the implications of these findings."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Relying on a novel integration of both survey data (N = 3629) and egocentric social network interviews (N = 53), this study explores associations between patterns of social support and online gaming involvement and experience. In both our large survey and network interviews, informants who possess a greater number of \"alters\" (social ties) who support their gaming are more likely to report deriving pleasure from their online play. We also find that intensive or \"hardcore\" gamers show evidence of \"homophily,\" with such players having a greater number of gamer-alters in their \"important person\" social networks and thus a more homogenous social composition. Importantly, more intensively involved gamers' social networks also tend to be less dense and more fragmented. Interpreting the results, we argue that network consensus of social norms may compel garners to both behave and judge their behavior in certain distinctive positive and negative ways. At the same time, garners may also construct different types of networks by surrounding themselves with more supportive and like-minded alters. The employment of an ethnographically derived, mixed methodology allows us to go beyond more standard approaches that often rely on survey data alone. Our method lets us test social network theory hypotheses within gaming-related offline/online networks, ascertaining possible causal processes underlying links between social support and online gaming involvement and experience.

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "We employ existing data sets and agent-based modeling to forecast changes in religiosity and existential security among a collective of individuals overtime. Existential security reflects the extent of economic, socioeconomic and human development provided by society. Our model includes agents in social networks interacting with one another based on the education level of the agents, the religious practices of the agents, and each agent's existential security within their natural and social environments. The data used to inform the values and relationships among these variables is based on rigorous statistical analysis of the International Social Survey Programme Religion Module (ISSP) and the Human Development Report (HDR). We conduct an evaluation that demonstrates, for the countries and time periods studied, that our model provides a more accurate forecast of changes in existential security and religiosity than two alternative approaches. The improved accuracy is largely due to the inclusion of social networks with educational homophily which alters the way in which religiosity and existential security change in the model. These dynamics grow societies where two individuals with the same initial religious practices (or belief In God, or supernatural beliefs) evolve differently based on the educational backgrounds of the individuals with which they surround themselves. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our model and provide direction for future work."

    "Abs": "Regular physical activity contributes to higher levels of well-being, healthy aging and prevention of several chronic diseases such as depression. To establish or change behaviours concerning physical activity, social contagion may play a role. The aim of this study was to model the contagion of physical activity based on empirical Twitter data and to assess the role of homophily within this contagion. To model the contagion of physical activity, an adaptive temporal-causal network model was designed, and accordingly, the parameters of the model were tuned using empirical data obtained from Twitter. Two variants of the adaptive temporal-causal network model were created, in which one calculated the weights of the connections between the nodes based on follow relations on Twitter, while in the other the connection weights were modulated by the homophily principle. The results indicate that within the considered social network of already active persons homophily does not play an important role in the physical activity behaviour."

    "Abs": "It is well known that individuals in social networks tend to exhibit homophily, the preference of people to associate with others from the same social group or type. Graph assortativity or Modularity is the most accepted measure for the homophily level of the whole network. It is well defined for simple networks where each node has a single type, and edges are unweighted.In this work, we extend modularity and assortativity in several ways. First, we define type assortativity which measures the homophily level of each type and enable the comparison between types of different size within the network. Second, we extend the measures to the case of nodes with multiple types and weighted edges. We evaluate our definitions on a weighted, research collaboration, social network between the most cited authors in the ACM digital library. We use nationality-based multiple types where a author can belong to multiple nationalities. While nationality-based homophily is trivial when the network is large (based on local research at universities) our empirical results show that even for the top 1000 authors a high level of nationality-based homophily exists, and different nationalities exhibit a different level of homophily."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "The growing significance of social media among potential voters has been recognized by politicians because social media provides a direct method for political actors to connect with their citizens and organize them into online clusters through their use of hashtags. However, with few exclusions, most of the former studies stressed on the identification of personal tweets or cumulative properties of a mass of tweets and political fondness of discrete users, not on partisan public in the U.S. Thus, there is a lack of complete understanding about online social network of politically conflicting public and the public discourse in the network. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate how people adopt political information on Twitter via hashtag as a networked public and how people facilitate political communication among users with similar or disparate political orientations. This study confirmed the theory of homophily in adopting political hashtags on Twitter network. The referred media and highly mentioned domains for each network also support the concept of homophily. The manually examined users with top betweenness centralities were identified as opinion leaders and their tweeting patterns provide evidences that they play key roles in disseminating information through eWOM by occupying an important relational spot in the network."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Homophily - tendency for people to form social connections with similar others - is one of the key topics in social network analysis. It indicates to what extent people tend to be similar to their friends and in what dimensions. For the long time homophily was just an index of the social similarity, but for the recent years the interest for the homophily formation, dynamics and multidimensionality increased. In this paper we investigate the homophily in such social constructed behavior as food consumption and academic achievements. The study of body mass index in social network context reveals the presence of homophily, which means that persons with similar constitution are more likely to be interconnected with each other. Interestingly, that healthy food consumption has no impact on social network formation, but there is homophily based on fast food consumption. Thus, 'bad habits' are stronger forces for the social ties formation. This results show that social constructed behavior is an important component on the process of social network formation."

Together they provide an overview of the festival's network structure, and rich evidence of the experiences of individuals in different parts of the network. UCINET software is used to analyse relationships between volunteers, and attribute data based on their demographics, engagement with the festival and responses to Likert-type statements on the study's main themes. Interviewees were sampled as a function of their network centrality, aggregated across a range of measures. A core-periphery network structure was revealed, focused on seven central individuals with established commitments to the organisation. This configuration outweighed alternative arrangements, including the functional departments that interviewees cited as being important to their relationships to the festival. Homophily, the propensity to associate with others with whom we are similar, is explored against status' definitions (such as age and gender) and value' (including beliefs and attitudes). Peripheral interviewees were shown to have less detailed knowledge of the festival's relationships with its neighbourhood, but a clearer sense of how the festival had benefited them personally. Members of the core group were representative of the broader network on a number of attributes apart from the country of birth, with evidence that better communication from core to periphery could benefit the overall organisation in its mission to represent a diverse mix of influences. RESUMENEn este trabajo se exploran la diversidad y la igualdad en un festival de arte voluntario escoces a traves de un estudio basado en el analisis de la red social y entrevistas de seguimiento.

Se utiliza el software UCINET para analizar las relaciones entre los voluntarios y atribuir datos basados en sus demograficos, compromiso con el festival y respuestas a afirmaciones tipo Likert sobre los puntos principales del estudio. Los entrevistados fueron muestreados como una funcion de su centralidad en la red, agregado a traves de un conjunto de medidas. Se revelo una estructura de red centro-periferica centrada en siete individuos con compromisos establecidos con la organizacion. Esta configuracion eclipsaba disposciones alternativas incluyendo los departamentos funcionales que los entrevistados citaban como importantes en su relacion con el festival. Se explora la homofilia, la propension a asociarse con otros similares a nosotros, frente a definiciones de estatus' (tales como edad y genero) y valor' (incluyendo creencias y actitudes). Los entrevistados perifericos mostraban tener un conocimiento menos detallado de las relaciones del festival con su vecindario pero un claro sentido de como el festival los beneficiaba a ellos personalmente. Los miembros del grupo principal eran representativos de la red mas amplia en un conjunto de atributos mas alla del pais de nacimiento, con evidencia de que una mejor comunicacion desde el nucleo a la periferia podria beneficiar a la organizacion general en su mision de representar una diversa mezcla de influencias.PALABRAS CLAVESfestival; homofilia; analisis de red social; SNA; diversidad; igualdad; UCINET RESUME travers une analyse de reseaux sociaux basee sur des enquetes et des interviews de suivi, cet article explore la diversite et l'egalite lors d'un festival artistique ecossais de benevolat.

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "Increasingly diversity researchers call for further studies of group micro-processes and dynamics to understand the paradoxical effects of diversity on group performance. In this study, based on analyses of in-group, networked, homophilous interactions, we aim to explain further the effects of diversity on group performance in a parallel problem-solving task, both experimentally and computationally. We developed a \"whodunit\" problem-solving experiment with 116 participants assigned to different-sized groups. Experimental results show that low diversity and high homophily levels are associated with lower performance while the effects of group size are not significant. To investigate this further, we developed an agent-based computational model (ABM), through which we inspected (a) the effect of different homophily and diversity strengths on performance, and (b) the robustness of such effects across group size variations. Overall, modeling results were consistent with our experimental findings, and revealed that the strength of homophily can drive diversity towards a positive or negative impact on performance. We also observed that increasing group size has a very marginal effect. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the implications of diversity in-group problem-solving by providing an integration of both experimental and computational perspectives in the analysis of group processes."

    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "John Stuart Mill advocated for increased interactions between individuals of dissenting opinions for the reason that it would improve society. Whether Mill and similar arguments that advocate for opinion diversity are valid depends on background assumptions about the psychology and sociality of individuals. The field of opinion dynamics is a burgeoning testing ground for how different combinations of sociological and psychological facts contribute to phenomena that affect opinion diversity, such as polarization. This paper applies some recent results from the opinion dynamics literature to assess the impacts of the Millian suggestion. The goal is to understand how the scope of the validity of Mill-style arguments depends on plausible assumptions that can be formalized using agent-based models, a common modeling approach in opinion dynamics. The most salient insight is that homophily (increased interactions between like-minded individuals) does not sufficiently explain decreased opinion diversity. Hence, decreasing homophily by increasing interactions between individuals of dissenting opinions is not the simple solution that a Millian-style argument may advocate."

    "Title": "A Micro-Foundation of Social Capital in Evolving Social Networks",
    "Year": 2018,
    "Abs": "A social network confers benefits and advantages on individuals (and on groups); the literature refers to these benefits and advantages as social capital. An individual's social capital depends on its position in the network and on the shape of the network-but positions in the network and the shape of the network are determined endogenously and change as the network forms and evolves. This paper presents a micro-founded mathematical model of the evolution of a social network and of the social capital of individuals within the network. The evolution of the network and of social capital are driven by exogenous and endogenous processes-entry, meeting, linking-that have both random and deterministic components. These processes are influenced by the extent to which individuals are homophilic (prefer others of their own type), structurally opportunistic (prefer neighbors of neighbors to strangers), socially gregarious (desire more or fewer connections) and by the distribution of types in the society. In the analysis, we identify different kinds of social capital: bonding capital refers to links to others; popularity capital refers to links from others; bridging capital refers to connections between others. We show that each form of capital plays a different role and is affected differently by the characteris tics of the society. Bonding capital is created by forming a circle of connections; homophily increases bonding capital because it makes this circle of connections more homogeneous. Popularity capital leads to preferential attachment: individuals who become popular tend to become more and more popular because others are more likely to link to them. Homophily creates inequality in the popularity capital attained by different social categories; more gregarious types of agents are more likely to become popular. However, in homophilic societies, individuals who belong to less gregarious, less opportunistic, or major types are likely to be more central in the network and thus acquire a bridging capital. And, while extreme homophily maximizes an individual's bonding capital, it also creates structural holes in the network, which hinder the exchange of ideas and information across social categories. Such structural holes represent a potential source of bridging capital: non-homophilic (tolerant or open-minded) individuals can fill these holes and broker interactions at the interface between different social categories."

To effectively exploit such huge online resources by using incomplete user profiles, which are very common on social media sites and can be caused by user privacy settings, it is meaningful to explore user profile identification methods. In this paper, we focus on gender identification using reposting behaviors on social networks. Whereas most existing works rely on pure statistical methods, we propose a scheme that is underpinned by homophily and four intuitive methods based on it by combining knowledge of statistics and sociology. For our data set, which was obtained from Sina Weibo and contained 1039 test samples and 528k user profiles, our methods perform with 86.7% accuracy. We explore the sensitivity of our methods on the scale of the data set and find surprisingly competitive results surpassing the binary classification baseline. Finally, we further suggest possible extensions to our methods."

This is unsurprising, given the low density of population, limited intercommunity commerce, and importance of direct city-market relations. Social relations among rural communities are also important in shaping rural livelihoods and lifeways. We report on the findings of a large-scale census of communities in the Napo River basin in northeastern Peru (n=174). Data were gathered on intervillage crop seed acquisition and cooperative labor sharing as two key inputs in agriculture, and on intervillage soccer matches, which are integral to rural social life. We analyze the socio-spatial networks of each practice, paying attention to settlement patterns, community ethnicity, and differential access to the uplands. We find that seeds and labor flow along soccer network lines. Rural social networks appear to be structured strongly by ethnicity (homophily) and reflect important complementarities between upland and lowland communities (weak ties)."

    "Abs": "Recently, some works have been done in studying activity network as a more realistic representation of users' behavior in online social networks. However, there is a major deficiency of a suitable definition of activity network based on a comprehensive study of various activity networks separately and combined. The main purpose of our research is to understand the differences between users' behavior by various Facebook activities, so as to claim that these networks should not be blindly composed; neither should the result of analyzing each of them individually be generalized to others. For this purpose, degree distribution, small-world phenomenon, degree correlation, reciprocity, and homophily by different attributes of various activity networks are studied. Then, we study densification and shrinking diameter properties and some structural characteristics of activity networks over time. We also examine microscopic evolution of different activity networks. Ultimately, we conclude that there are some differences between users' behavior by various Facebook activities but all evolve almost similarly at macroscopic and microscopic levels. However, post network evolves considerably different from other activity networks. Accordingly, a comprehensive definition for activity network is suggested so that the results of analyzing the modeled activity network fit realistic data."

We show empirical traits related to our simulation: Employing Swiss national referenda data from 2008 to 2012, we show that members of parliament match referenda outcomes in their residence communities closer than they do in neighboring communities and that this wedge interacts significantly with the relative size of the residence community."

    "Abs": "Despite population opinion in China favoring men over women, data on a large probability sample of Chinese entrepreneurs show that men and women on average build similar network structures, experience similar distributions of network advantage, achieve similar levels of business success, and experience similar performance returns to their network advantage. Digging into network content, male and female entrepreneurs have similarly close and trusting relations with similar kinds of contacts, with one exception, gender homophily: men are more likely than women to operate in a network composed entirely of men, while women operate more often than men in a network containing multiple female contacts. There is also gender pattern in the use of contacts, reflecting conservative attitudes in the broader society: Women are the object of more interaction on technical matters out of the public eye, while men are the preferred contact for representation (men and women more often cite male contacts for help in founding the business, dealing with suppliers, and dealing with customers). The gender pattern is more obvious in the business contacts of men than in the business contacts of women, and more linked with business success for men. In sum, there is gender pattern to the networks around male and female entrepreneurs, but the network theory of advantage from access to structural holes similarly predicts the success of male and female entrepreneurs regardless of gender."

Analyzing data from 82 clusters in Germany, we show that while privately funded cluster organizations have fewer formal partnerships, their managers more actively collaborate at the informal level. Furthermore, we find tendencies towards funding based homophily and cross-level closure at both levels, formal and informal."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "The triad census is an important approach to understand local structure in network science, providing comprehensive assessments of the observed relational configurations between triples of actors in a network. However, researchers are often interested in combinations of relational and categorical nodal attributes. In this case, it is desirable to account for the label, or color, of the nodes in the triad census. In this paper, we describe an efficient algorithm for constructing the colored triad census, based, in part, on existing methods for the classic triad census. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm using empirical and simulated data for both undirected and directed graphs. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces computational time by approximately many-fold over the naive approach. We also apply the colored triad census to the Zachary karate club network dataset. We simultaneously show the efficiency of the algorithm, and a way to conduct a statistical test on the census by forming a null distribution from 1000 realizations of a mixing matrix conditioned graph and comparing the observed colored triad counts to the expected. From this, we demonstrate the method's utility in our discussion of results about homophily, heterophily, and bridging, simultaneously gained via the colored triad census. In sum, the proposed algorithm for the colored triad census brings novel utility to social network analysis in an efficient package."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "Studies have shown that women's professional networks are often less powerful and effective than men's in terms of exchanged benefits, yet the motivations that underlie the networking behaviours remain less well understood. Based on an interview study of 37 high-profile female leaders working in large German corporations, we found that not only the extrinsic barrier of structural exclusion from powerful networks, but also the intrinsic barrier of women's hesitations to instrumentalize social ties are key to answering our research question: Why do women build less effective networks than men? Our analysis points to the existence of structural exclusion resulting from work-family conflict and homophily. With regard to personal hesitation, we identified two elements that were associated with under-benefiting from networking: moral considerations in social interactions and gendered modesty. Our study makes two important contributions. First, by highlighting personal hesitation as an intrinsic barrier, it extends the understanding of women's motivations for networking based on social exchange theory. Second, based on structural barriers and personal hesitation, it develops a grounded theory model of networking that offers a holistic understanding of reasons that, from the perspective of the focal women, contribute to gender inequality in the workplace."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "Peers are an important source of normative pressure in the context of adolescent risky behaviors, which is reflected in high behavioral homophily repeatedly found in adolescent groups. Two psychosocial mechanisms underlying this similarity have been identified: peer influence (or pressure) and peer selection (the process of befriending individuals similar to oneself). The two mechanisms have been explored primarily in the context of non-sexual adolescent risk taking (e.g., tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse). This study is the first longitudinal comparison of peer influence and peer selection in the context of female adolescents' sexual initiation. Using data from 162 female high-school students (M-age = 16 years, SD = 0.47) surveyed online twice in the period of 18 months, a cross-lagged path analysis pointed to a significant effect of peer influence, but not peer selection. Contrary to expectations, the moderating effect of peer conformism was not corroborated. This study's findings confirm the importance of taking into account direct and indirect peer influence when designing comprehensive sexuality education programs."

Individual, relational, and network characteristics that influence network instability in the absence of a significant life transition/crisis are less understood. We focus on those ties that transition from active to dormant. Because the shift to dormancy is often interpreted as a reduction in support or social capital, it is considered problematic. This study is based on longitudinal survey data of middle-class adults who did not undergo life changes. Even in this context of relative stability, support networks experience rates of dormancy similar to those observed during periods of major upheaval. Tie dormancy is unrelated to individual characteristics, network size and density, or homophily along dimensions other than sex. Frequency and medium of communication are particularly notable as factors that were not related to tie dormancy. Ties were less likely to become dormant if they were geographically or emotionally close, immediate kin or neighbors, highly supportive, the same sex, or more embedded in the network. These findings provide context for how support networks operate when not buffeted by exogenous forces. They provide a baseline for understanding the impact on networks of transitions, trauma, new media, and difficult life circumstances."

    "Title": "What Drives Ethnic Homophily? A Relational Approach on How Ethnic Identification Moderates Preferences for Same-Ethnic Friends",
    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "Individual preferences for same-ethnic friends contribute to persistent segregation of adolescents' friendship networks. Yet, we know surprisingly little about the mechanisms behind ethnic homophily. Prior research suggests that ethnic homophily is ubiquitous, but a social identity perspective indicates that strong ingroup identification drives ingroup favoritism. Combining a social identity perspective with a relational approach, we ask whether the presumed increased homophily of high identifiers extends to all ingroup members, or whether it is conditional on the strength of same-ethnics' identification. We propose that the strength of ethnic identification affects not only how much individuals desire same-ethnic friends, but also how attractive they are as potential friends to others. Fitting stochastic actor-oriented models to German adolescent school-based network panel data, we find that ethnic homophily is driven by an interplay of peers' ethnic identification: high identifiers befriend same-ethnic peers who share their strong ethnic identification, while excluding same-ethnic low identifiers. Low identifiers, in turn, tend to avoid befriending inter-ethnic high identifiers. Our relational approach reveals that ethnic homophily is hardly ubiquitous but requires strong identification of both parties of a (potential) friendship."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "Aggregate and systemic risk in complex systems are emergent phenomena depending on two properties: the idiosyncratic risk of the elements and the topology of the network of interactions among them. While a significant attention has been given to aggregate risk assessment and risk propagation once the above two properties are given, less is known about how the risk is distributed in the network and its relations with its topology. We study this problem by investigating a large proprietary dataset of payments among 2.4M Italian firms, whose credit risk rating is known. We document significant correlations between local topological properties of a node (firm) and its risk. Moreover we show the existence of an homophily of risk, i.e.the tendency of firms with similar risk profile to be statistically more connected among themselves. This effect is observed when considering both pairs of firms and communities or hierarchies identified in the network. We leverage this knowledge to show the predictability of the missing rating of a firm using only the network properties of the associated node."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "Social networking sites (SNSs) facilitate self-expression and promote social connections. There has been growing scholarly attention to the affect-charged collectivities created online in the aftermath of disasters and mass traumas. This study was designed to examine how individuals affiliate in SNS-based commemoration of a mass trauma, taking advantage of a large Weibo (the Chinese equivalent of Twitter) data set which captures users' responses over 4 years to the anniversary of the Nanjing massacre, a major traumatic event in Chinese history. Machine learning-based content analysis was combined with dyadic-level network analysis to examine the content Weibo users create and the conversational structures they formed. The results reveal that homophily, geographic proximity, and preferential attachment work in tandem with displays of emotion to influence the formation of online conversational ties. Expressions of negative emotions were found to facilitate or inhibit the homophily effect. Being exposed to the display of anger amplifies the homophily effect among the users, while sadness weakens it. The findings point to the importance of examining specific emotions rather than global (positive-negative) feelings in understanding the dynamics of SNS-based interaction."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "The spread of information, opinions, preferences, and behavior across social media is a crucial feature of the current functioning of our economy, politics, and culture. One of the emerging channels for spreading social collective action and funding of novelty in all these domains is Crowdfunding on various platforms such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Sellaband, and may others. The exact spreading mechanism of this collective action is not well-understood. The general belief is that virality plays a crucial role. Namely, the common hypothesis is that the information or behavior propagates through individuals affecting one another, presumably, through the links connecting them in social networks. The aim of our study is to find out the actual spreading mechanism in one particular case: spread of financial support for individual Kickstarter campaigns. To our surprise, our studies show that \"virality\" plays here only a minor role. We used this result to construct a simple behavior-grounded stochastic predictor of the success of Kickstarter campaigns which is not based on the viral mechanism. The crucial feature of the model underlying the prediction algorithm is that the success of a campaign depends less on the backers influencing one another (\"virality\") but rather on the campaign appealing to a particular class of high-pledge backers. This appeal is usually revealed at the very beginning of the campaign and it is an excellent success predictor. The case of Kickstarter is consistent with a recently proposed generic hypothesis that popularity in social media arises more from independent responses by individuals belonging to a large homophily class rather than from percolation, self-exciting processes, and other cooperative mechanisms resulting from mutual influence between individuals. Thus, the very concept of \"virality\", which implies contagion between participating individuals, plays only a minor role in the success mechanism proposed hereby. A more appropriate term for the mechanism underlying the social success in our model could be \"social appeal\" or \"social fitness\"."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "Community in social networks is a nebulous concept. A community is generally assumed to be formed by people who possess similar attributes or characteristics, also known as \"homophily\". Although there has been a lot of research on community detection based on network topology, the semantic interpretation of communities is rarely studied. The present work aims to understand the behavioral similarity of users present in their personal neighborhood communities formed by friends, relatives, or colleagues, and addresses two fundamental questions: (i) Are communities firmed by users who possess similar behavioral traits? If so, does this apply to all those sub-networks, i.e., friends, relatives, and colleagues? (ii) Does adding behavioral node-specific attributes/features to the nodes in a network lead to better community detection? To better understand the psycho-sociological homophilic nature of personal networks, the personalities and values of Twitter users were analyzed using the well-established \"Big-5 personality model\" and \"Schwartz sociological behavior model\". Empirical results based on the psychosociological behavior show that friends networks exhibit homophily, whereas relatives and colleagues networks do not exhibit such homophilic behavior. It can also be observed that neurotic people tend to behave heterogeneously with people of various personality traits. In addition, it is shown that such empirical evidence can be used as features for the tasks of community detection and link prediction."

Based on statistical models for network data, the study builds on classical explanations of co-sponsorships highlighting the role of similar ties between MPs, such as party membership, legislative committee assignments, electoral district or gender. It shows that, on top of these traditional forms of homophily, MPs' ties to interest groups matter as well. MPs with ties to a similar type of interest groups are more likely to co-sponsor their respective proposals. The same holds for MPs with ties to groups active in the same policy domain. These findings have implications for the study of groups' lobbying, legislative behaviour and representative democracy."

    "Abs": "We introduce a simple and extendable coevolution model for the analysis of longitudinal network and nodal attribute data. The model features parameters that describe three phenomena: homophily, contagion and autocorrelation of the network and nodal attribute process. Homophily here describes how changes to the network may be associated with between-node similarities in terms of their nodal attributes. Contagion refers to how node-level attributes may change depending on the network. The model we present is based upon a pair of intertwined autoregressive processes. We obtain least-squares parameter estimates for continuous-valued fully observed network and attribute data. We also provide methods for Bayesian inference in several other cases, including ordinal network and attribute data, and models involving latent nodal attributes. These model extensions are applied to an analysis of international relations data and to data from a study of teen delinquency and friendship networks."

    "Abs": "The emergence of online social networks has revolutionized millions of web users' behavior so that their interactions with each other produce huge amounts of data on different activities. Community detection, herein, is one of the most important tasks. The very recent trend is to detect meaningful communities based on users' interactions or the activity network. However, in many of such studies, authors consider the basic network model while almost ignoring the model of the interactions in the multi-layer network. In this research, an experimental study is done to compare community detection in Facebook friendship network to that of activity network, considering different activities in Facebook OSN such as sharing. Then, a new community detection evaluation metric based on homophily is proposed. Eventually, a new method of community detection based on different activities in Facebook social network is presented. In this method, we generalized three familiar similarity methods, Jaccard, Common Neighbors and Adamic-Adar for multi-layered network model."

Using dyadic data, results demonstrate that the highest estimates of friendship quality come from actors who have non-deviant friends and who also refrain from theft and violence themselves. Shared deviance within the friendship, referred to as 'homophily,' harms friendship quality, although it does not mediate or moderate the deviance - friendship quality link. Overall, deviance relates to friendship quality in a way that supports a bonding tradition more than a learning tradition."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "Using data from the Canadian General Social Survey (2008), this study considers the role of social networks in immigrants' earnings. Despite higher levels of education, immigrants continue to earn less than native-born Canadians. This paper shows that social network characteristics are associated with earnings net of the effects of human capital and visible minority status. Social networks are important for understanding immigrants' earnings both as a direct cause of employment disadvantages and as a force that exacerbates the disadvantages that immigrants face due to racial discrimination, a lack of proficiency in Canada's official languages, and/or discrepancies over foreign credentials. While most current data on immigrant networks is limited to specific ethnic groups, cities, and/or occupations, the present study contributes to scholarship by generalizing data to all immigrants in Canada. This study also expands the temporal scope by comparing immigrants who arrived in the 2000s, 1990s, and earlier. Future research and public policy should put greater emphasis on the role of social networks in the economic integration of new immigrants."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "Opinion dynamics models usually center on explaining how macro-level regularities in public opinion (uniformity, polarization or clusterization) emerge as the effect of local interactions of a population with an initial random distribution of opinions. However, with only a few exceptions, the understanding of patterns of public opinion change has generally been dismissed in this literature. To address this theoretical gap in our understanding of opinion dynamics, we built a multi-agent simulation model that could help to identify some mechanisms underlying changes in public opinion. Our goal was to build a model whose behavior could show different types of endogenously (not induced by the researcher) triggered transitions (rapid or slow, radical or soft). The paper formalizes a situation where agents embedded in different types of networks (random, small world and scale free networks) interact with their neighbors and express an opinion that is the result of different mechanisms: a coherence mechanism, in which agents try to stick to their previously expressed opinions; an assessment mechanism, in which agents consider available external information on the topic; and a social influence mechanism, in which agents tend to approach their neighbor's opinions. According to our findings, only scale-free networks show fluctuations in public opinion. Public opinion changes in this model appear as a diffusion process of individual opinion shifts that is triggered by an opinion change of a highly connected agent. The frequency, rapidity and radicalness of the diffusion, and hence of public opinion fluctuations, positively depends on how influential external information is in individual opinions and negatively depends on how homophilic social interactions are."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "How diverse are sharing economy platforms? Are they fair marketplaces, where all participants operate on a level playing field, or are they large-scale online aggregators of offline human biases? Often portrayed as easy-to-access digital spaces whose participants receive equal opportunities, such platforms have recently come under fire due to reports of discriminatory behaviours among their users, and have been associated with gentrification phenomena that exacerbate preexisting inequalities along racial lines. In this paper, we focus on the Airbnb sharing economy platform, and analyse the diversity of its user base across five large cities. We find it to be predominantly young, female, and white. Notably, we find this to be true even in cities with a diverse racial composition. We then introduce a method based on the statistical analysis of networks to quantify behaviours of homophily, heterophily and avoidance between Airbnb hosts and guests. Depending on cities and property types, we do find signals of such behaviours relating both to race and gender. We use these findings to provide platform design recommendations, aimed at exposing and possibly reducing the biases we detect, in support of a more inclusive growth of sharing economy platforms."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "We consider the specification of effects of numerical actor attributes, having an interval level of measurement, in statistical models for directed social networks. A fundamental mechanism is homophily or assortativity, where actors have a higher likelihood to be tied with others having similar values of the variable under study. But there are other mechanisms that may also play a role in how the attribute values of two actors influence the likelihood of a tie between them. We discuss three additional mechanisms: aspiration, the tendency to send more ties to others having high values; attachment conformity, sending more ties to others whose values are close to the \"social norm\"; and sociability, where those having higher values will tend to send more ties generally. These mechanisms may operate jointly, and then their effects will be confounded. We present a specification representing these effects simultaneously by a four-parameter quadratic function of the values of sender and receiver. Flexibility can be increased by a five-parameter extension. We argue that for numerical actor attributes having important effects on directed networks, these specifications may provide an improvement. An illustration is given of dependence of advice ties on academic grades, analyzed by the Stochastic Actor-oriented Model."

Our study reveals strong evidence for BMI clustering in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden; adolescents tend to be friends with others who have a similar BMI. Furthermore, we extend current debate and explore friendship characteristics that moderate the relationship between social networks and BMI. We demonstrate that BMI clustering is more pronounced in (1) strong compared to weak friendships and (2) between adolescents of the same biological sex. These findings indicate that more research on social networks and health is needed which distinguishes between different kinds of relationships."

Young people with above-average results place more importance on agreement in political opinions, but do not regard the partner's homemaking abilities or financial situation as too important. The results further show that partner preferences differ according to the education capital of the background family and according to preferred partnership arrangement. We also find significant differences in the partner preferences of men and women that reflect ideas about traditional gender roles. Women favour characteristics that relate to status, and men assign more importance to physical looks."

Based on 1,675,999 book reviews indexed in the Social Science Citation Index and Arts and Humanities Citation Index over the 1975-2016 period, our results show that book reviews arc decreasing in importance in all disciplines-especially those where books have historically been peripheral. We also observe a high rate of homophily between reviewers and reviewed books, with researchers being primarily interested in the books that have been written by someone from their own country. Hence, despite the now widely held assumptions of the globalization of science, social science and humanities remains a highly localized activity."

    "Year": 2019,
    "Abs": "As one of the most successful recommendation techniques, collaborative filtering provides a useful recommendation by associating an active user with a crowd of users who share the same interests. Although some achievements have been achieved both in theory and practice, the efficiency of recommender systems has been negatively affected by the problems of cold start and data sparsity recently. To solve the above problems, the trust relationship among users is employed into recommender systems to build a learning model to further promote the prediction quality and users' satisfaction. However, most of the existing social networks-based recommendation algorithms fail to take into account the fact that users with different levels of trust and backgrounds, that is, user's social status and homophily have different degrees of influence on their friends. In this paper, a novel social matrix factorization-based recommendation method is proposed to improve the recommendation quality by fusing user's social status and homophily. User's social status and homophily play important roles in improving the performance of recommender systems. We first build a user's trust relationship network based on user social relationships and the rating information. Then, the degree of trust is calculated through the trust propagation method and the PageRank algorithm. Finally, the trust relationship is integrated into the matrix factorization model to accurately predict unknown ratings. The proposed method is evaluated using real-life datasets including the Epinions and Douban datasets. The experimental results and comparisons demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to the existing social networks-based recommendation algorithms."

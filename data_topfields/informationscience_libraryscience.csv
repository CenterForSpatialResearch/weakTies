This paper aims to concentrate on the role of tacit knowledge sharing in fostering innovation capability of an organization. Specifically, the study considers social capital (relational, cognitive and structural) as an important precursors to tacit knowledge sharing, which in turn, influences innovation capability of an organization. The study further discusses the role that knowledge reciprocation plays in successful tacit knowledge sharing. The relation between knowledge quality and innovation capability is also discussed in the paper. Design/methodology/approach The investigation started with a review of extant literature in the field of knowledge sharing and innovation to derive a set of constructs. A set of hypotheses was developed based on the identified constructs, which was subsequently validated through a primary survey based on a structured questionnaire on a sample size of 190 respondents from the Indian industrial domain. The survey responses were subsequently analysed using the statistical technique of structural equation modeling and conclusions were drawn from the findings. Additionally, careful attention was paid in eliminating the common method bias, which is often associated with a primary survey. Findings A set of six hypotheses were derived based on the identified constructs and were subsequently validated. While validating the hypotheses, it was observed that while knowledge reciprocity, relational social capital and cognitive social capital was positive associated with tacit knowledge sharing, structural social capital did not have a significant effect on the same. Additionally, it was also observed that both tacit knowledge sharing and the quality of knowledge were positively associated with innovation capability. Originality/value Although there is a growing body of literature concerning the role of knowledge management in innovation, there still a dearth in discussing the role of tacit knowledge sharing in exploiting the innovation capability of an organization. The main discussion of this paper brings together a set of important constructs that exhibits the significant role that tacit knowledge sharing plays in determining the innovation capability of an organization.

The paper draws insights from psychology, history, religion, current events and management literature.

They propose a new conceptual process model of KS with humility as an important variable to consider. This work highlights several promising directions for future research.

However, minimal effort has been made to elaborate on the precise role of social media in supporting TMS for enhancing absorptive capacity (ACAP) and knowledge creation capability (KCC) of the team, which in turn might influence team creative performance (TCP).

This study is in support of the hypothesis that perceived trustworthiness is widely implicated as a mediating factor between those social-cognitive factors and IKS. Previous work, however, uncovered only a handful of such mediating effects. It is argued here that the paucity may have been due to limitations of the statistical methods. This study employs PROCESS, a more powerful current method for mediation analysis in an attempt to uncover previously hidden relationships. Analyses were performed on data collected from 275 knowledge workers (legal professionals and paralegals) engaged in shared legal project work, at one of Canadas largest multijurisdictional law firms. Social-cognitive factors that were considered were shared language, shared vision, tie strength, age/gender/educational homophily and relationship length. IKS outcomes were willingness to share, willingness to use and perceived receipt of useful information/knowledge. Consistent with the hypothesis, the more powerful method revealed a large number of significant mediating effects of perceived trustworthiness.

Moreover, the knowledge based view (KBV) has long suggested that due to stronger cognitive links within firms, internal compared to external service provision creates better conditions for knowledge sharing. Empirical evidence for this claim is however scarce, and the KBV does not explain the mechanisms for more knowledge sharing in internal sourcing in detail. Moreover, there is now some evidence to suggest that firms' relationships with external sourcing partners are becoming more similar to those with captive centres, which represent a less traditional form of insourcing setting. To scrutinize the possible knowledge sharing advantages of internal sourcing in more depth, we turn to social capital (SC) research. There are some theoretical claims that SC and knowledge sharing are stronger within than between firms, and there is ample evidence that SC facilitates knowledge sharing. Our survey results suggest that the extent of knowledge sharing and SC are indeed stronger in a captive than in an external sourcing mode, and that structural (tie strength), cognitive (shared understanding), and relational (trust) aspects of SC mediate the effect of sourcing mode on the extent of knowledge sharing. By contrast, network stability (a structural aspect) mediated knowledge sharing only indirectly, by reinforcing the other SC aspects.

Some others have investigated knowledge management among open-source-software (OSS) developers and discussed factors influencing knowledge transfer within development teams (e.g. Joshi and Sarker, 2006). In the domain of open source software (OSS) communities, more companies are now attempting to establish relationships to benefit from these potential value-creating communities; and project managers could in fact target different goals within software development teams including knowledge transfer within and between teams. We step forward to distinguish knowledge transfer within groups as opposed to knowledge transfer between groups; where relevant projects are bundled into separate strongly intra-connected groups. In knowledge management literature there is a trade-off between sparse network structures (Burt, 2000, 2002) versus dense network structures (Walker et al., 1997; Coleman, 1988). It is argued that the former facilitates the diffusion and generation of ideas among groups, while the latter affects the implementation of idea within each dense group. To our best knowledge, there has been no study to investigate the relationship between dense and sparse network structures. We propose that knowledge transfer within dense groups has a positive influence on knowledge transfer between sparse groups, in that intragroup density, group size, developers centrality and betweenness could impact intergroup coupling. To prove our hypothesis, we use a complex network of open source software (OSS) as the domain of interest, where developers represent nodes and two developers contributing to a project task represent a network tie. Developers contributing to tasks in groups other than their own can explore novel ideas via sharing knowledge, whereas developers contributing to tasks inside groups exploit ideas to improve those projects.

Specifically, it considers social capital (i.e., the result of a firm's inter-organizational relationships) as an essential precursor of knowledge identification capabilities and deliberated knowledge acquisition strategies. This study aims to propose that cognitive and relational dimensions of a firm's inter-organizational social capital are mediating factors of the relationship between structural social capital and knowledge identification capabilities and the relationship between structural social capital and the deliberated acquisition of external knowledge, respectively. The relationship between knowledge identification capability and external knowledge acquisition is also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach This is a cross-sectional quantitative study with a sample of 87 firms from Spanish biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. From an extensive literature review, we developed three hypotheses that were tested using the partial least squares technique and structural equations model. Findings The results only support a mediating effect of cognitive social capital in the relationship between structural social capital and knowledge identification capability and a partial mediation effect of relational social capital in the relationship between structural social capital and knowledge acquisition. In addition, the findings show that firms with more advanced abilities to identify and assess the value of external knowledge will be likely to develop optimal deliberated strategies to acquire effectively such knowledge from its network partners. Research limitations/implications The limitations of this study are small sample size and the cross-sectional nature of the study. The study also focuses on only two specific and innovative industries. Practical implications Managers should understand that good management of inter-organizational social capital allows the firm to develop dynamic capabilities for the identification and acquisition of valuable knowledge. The results of the study show that managers should concentrate on building knowledge identification capabilities and should also be aware of the possibilities that social capital can provide to a firm to formulate and implement effective strategies for external knowledge acquisition. Originality/value To date, there are relatively few studies focussing on knowledge identification capability and its relationships with the dimensions of a company's social capital as enablers of external knowledge acquisition. For managers, the identification of valuable knowledge by using inter-organizational relationships and networks is an essential issue, especially in innovative industries characterized by continuous change. Theoretically, this research highlights that social capital contributes to the development of dynamic capabilities, allowing the firm to sense and seize business opportunities based on external knowledge acquisition to achieve competitive advantages.",,,,"Donate, Mario J./L-5328-2014","Donate, Mario J./0000-0003-4087-2535",,,,,,,,,,,,1367-3270,1758-7484,,,,,2018,22,6,,,,,1332,1357,,10.1108/JKM-04-2017-0131,,,,,,,WOS:000438049900007,,,,,J,"Guo, SS; Guo, XT; Zhang, XF; Vogel, D",,,,"Guo, Shanshan; Guo, Xitong; Zhang, Xiaofei; Vogel, Doug",,,Doctor-patient relationship strength's impact in an online healthcare community,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"Doctor-patient (D-P) interaction currently faces a set of challenges owing to a dearth in medical resources and related communication reasons.

In addition, we have only little empirical knowledge of the actual tie strengthening process in online social networks.

We examine how the use of one ICT intervention-specifically, eHealth kiosks disseminating authenticated and accessible medical information-can alleviate the problem of high infant mortality in rural India. We investigate how mothers' social networks affect their use of eHealth kiosks, seeking professional medical care for their infants and, ultimately, infant mortality. Drawing on the social epidemiology and social networks literatures, we focus on advice and hindrance from both strong and weak ties as the conduit of social influence on mothers' health-related behaviors for the care of their infants. Over a period of 7 years, we studied 4,620 infants across 10 villages where the eHealth kiosks were implemented along with support resources for proxy use. The results revealed that (1) eHealth kiosk use promotes seeking professional medical care and reduces infant mortality, (2) mothers are especially vulnerable to hindrance from both strong and weak ties as they choose to maintain the status quo of traditional infant healthcare practices (e.g., reliance on untrained personnel, superstitions, fatalism) in villages, and (3) advice from both strong and weak ties offers the potential to break down misplaced beliefs about infant healthcare practices and to develop literacy on seeking professional medical care. In contrast, in a comparative group of 10 neighboring villages, the reduction in infant mortality was not as pronounced and the effect of professional medical care in reducing infant mortality was lower. Our findings suggest that an ICT intervention can effectively address one of society's most important problems (i.e., infant mortality) even in parts of the world with limited resources and deep suspicion of technology and change.

Empirical findings are based on the analysis of the 84 narrative reports submitted by school libraries as part of a national performance evaluation exercise that took place between 2010 and 2012. Data analysis followed the techniques of inductive data categorization, within case-analysis, and cross-case analysis. Findings - The exploration of the relational capabilities that school libraries in the Alentejo region of Portugal develop for acquiring new knowledge that exists externally in the community resulted in the identification of relationships that school libraries in the region have established to acquire new knowledge: connecting with and supporting organizations committed to civic engagement; facilitating discussions about challenging issues through strategic partnerships; convening community conversations to identify shared concerns and solutions; and embracing local culture to foster endogenous development.

Analysis comprised observation of the online debate, as well as semantic (co-word) network analysis of a ""big data"" set, consisting of 14 years of email exchange. The results were verified with the members of the community in a focus group manner. Findings - In terms of content, the knowledge management for development debate remains strongly engaged with actual development discourse, and it continues to be rather oriented toward tools and methods. In terms of learning, the community appears highly inclusive, and provides fertile ground for in-depth knowledge sharing, but shows less potential for innovative influences. Research limitations/implications - The study contributes to literature on knowledge management in the non-profit sector by showing how heterogeneous communities in the development domain generate knowledge and shape discourse. More specifically, the paper contributes to knowledge management for development literature by providing a comprehensive overview of how the domain has evolved since its emergence.

We apply and assess the framework in a qualitative case study of a large-scale implementation of a corporate social network site (SNS) in a global organization. We reveal organizational online networking as a multi-dimensional phenomenon with multiplex relationships that are unbalanced, primarily consist of weak ties and are subject to temporal change. Further, we identify discourse drivers and information retrievers as two mutually interdependent actor roles as an explanation for uneven levels of user contributions to the SNS. Based on our analysis, we elicit abstract order principles, such as topical discourses, and identify transactive memory theory as a potent explanation of the evolving interaction structures.

The current research examines whether network ties, which are an aspect of structural social capital that can be categorized into strong and weak social ties, can provide a non-trivial explanation for members' trust, reciprocity, and identification in a virtual community for website programming interest. This relationship enables us to examine a context in which members share a common goal of resolving programming problems through knowledge sharing in contrast with other community settings where only general topics are discussed (e.g., societal and emotional issues). Data were collected through a survey of a virtual community for website programming composed of 69 members. Affirming conventional perception, results of the study indicate that weak ties affect the level of generalized trust and facilitate group identification. Remarkably, the number of members' strong ties is not significantly related to the degree of their perceived norms regarding generalized reciprocity Reciprocity refers to a mutual expectation that a benefit granted at present should be repaid in the future. The results suggest two key points. First, even for a virtual community of interest, weak ties overshadow strong ties in explaining the outcome variables. Second, reciprocity is not guaranteed even in a focused form of discussion with a non-social topic that involves specialized knowledge. Therefore, virtual community members should be cautious even if ties are strong.

The mediating effects of trust and norms were also found to be significant. Trust directly influences knowledge sharing, and plays a mediating role between knowledge sharing and guanxi. This suggests that knowledge sharing is likely to occur when trust exists among employees. The results further indicate that norms mediate the relationship between guanxi and knowledge sharing. Guanxi among members influences knowledge sharing; therefore, organizations require a feasible solution using the relational norms mechanism.

Findings - Mobile messages are more effectively used to share information within strongly tied groups rather than weakly tied groups. However, there is little difference between weakly and strongly connected groups in terms of the perceived effectiveness of mobile messages used for social networking. Anxious people are more inclined to send mobile messages to individuals with whom they have weak ties, and people who perceived TSs send more mobile messages to individuals with whom they have strong ties.

Researchers often rely on social network analysis (SNA) when attempting to understand these technologies, often without considering how the novel capabilities of social media platforms might affect the underlying theories of SNA, which were developed primarily through studies of offline social networks. This article outlines several key differences between traditional offline social networks and online social media networks by juxtaposing an established typology of social network research with a well-regarded definition of social media platforms that articulates four key features. The results show that at four major points of intersection, social media has considerable theoretical implications for SNA. In exploring these points of intersection, this study outlines a series of theoretically distinct research questions for SNA in social media contexts.

Following the intuition of Nan Lin (2001), we conclude that the positions of researchers in institutional hierarchies are crucial to the way they access resources.

Design/methodology/approach - A single case study was conducted within a business unit at a multinational medical technology company. Data were collected through a mixed method. Findings - The results show that many R&D employees lack social networks through which they can acquire information about the users' needs. However, some R&D employees establish cost-efficient relationships to people with a direct experience of using the company's products. These relationships are established over time and are often used in a rather informal way to acquire user information. Moreover, the results show how R&D employees are purposefully complementing these relationships with more occasional interactions with people who hold direct and indirect use experiences. Research limitations/implications - As with most single-case studies, it will be important to replicate this investigation in other contexts to clarify the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications - The article shows how important it is that management provides R&D employees with opportunities to establish, nurture and utilize relationships conducive to information about the users' needs.

Findings - A recipient's trust in colleagues positively influences knowledge transfer and company tenure has a negative impact. At a dyadic level, the perceived expertise of a source, in addition to strength of ties, exerts a positive effect on knowledge transfer.

The purpose of this paper is to adopt social embeddedness and creativity theory to explore factors influencing blogger creativity. Design/methodology/approach - An online questionnaire and an online embeddedness system are used to collect data from 353 bloggers, including data on their motivation, integration ability, structural and relational embeddedness and creativity. Hierarchical regression is applied for statistical analysis. Findings - Analytical results show that structural embeddedness and relational embeddedness affect blogger creativity. Additionally motivation negatively moderates the relationship between structural embeddedness and creativity, and integration ability negatively moderates the relationship between relational embeddedness and creativity. Research limitations/implications - This study applies social embeddedness to elucidate the relationships among quantity and quality of professional knowledge and creativity. This study also discusses the moderating effect of motivation and integration ability on the relationship between social embeddedness and creativity.

So, determining factors that may influence knowledge sharing within an organization or among organizations has become an important area of research. This paper aims to review determinant factors influencing inter- and intra-organizational knowledge sharing in order to offer a framework. Design/methodology/approach - The present paper proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, the published literature on knowledge sharing has been reviewed extensively with consideration of their empirical applications. Next, based on the understanding gained from the previous stage, a conceptual framework of successful factors for effective inter- organizational knowledge sharing has been proposed. In the third phase, the proposed framework has been developed and finalized towards its maturity. Findings - Based on the literature, the authors have developed a framework for understanding factors which influence inter- organizational knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing among organizations appears theoretically sound, but it is a difficult task due to some complexities. Research limitations/implications - This paper attempts to set a theoretical framework for inter- organizational knowledge sharing as a foundation to address the gap in current literature though it does not claim to be comprehensive. Originality/value - A few attempts have been made to investigate success factors for inter- organizational knowledge sharing empirically or even theoretically, but this is the first of its kind that provides a theoretical framework to arrange success factors for the knowledge sharing based on inter- organizational collaborations.

Individuals and organisations are becoming increasingly involved in collaboration networks to share knowledge and generate innovation. SC theory has been adopted in several areas of study to explain how individuals, groups and organisations manage relationships to generate innovation. Design/methodology/approach - This review covers studies of SC in organisational behaviour, strategy and management over a period of 20 years. Findings - The literature review shows that knowledge types and knowledge transfer processes are the missing links in the relationship between structural SC and innovation. Moreover, the paper demonstrates that seemingly opposite configurations of SC are complementary to each other (structural holes vs dense networks; strong vs weak ties) and that contextual factors should be considered when discussing the effects of SC on knowledge transfer and innovation. In addition, it is the balance of different configurations of SC which enables an individual or a company to explore, access, assimilate and combine different knowledge types, which will lead to improved innovation outcomes.

One of the important properties of this network structure is referred to as social capital, which is the network of contacts and the associated values attached to these networks of contacts. This study provides empirical evidence of the influence of social capital and performance within the context of academic collaboration (coauthorship) and suggests that the collaborative process involves social capital embedded within relationships and network structures among direct coauthors. Association between scholars' social capital and their citation-based performance measures is examined. To overcome the limitations of traditional social network metrics for measuring the influence of scholars' social capital within coauthorship networks, the traditional social network metrics is extended by proposing two new measures, of which one is non-weighted (the power-diversity index) and the other (power-tie-diversity index) is weighted by the number of collaboration instances. The Spearman's correlation rank test is used to examine the association between scholars' social capital measures and their citation-based performance. Results suggest that research performance of authors is positively correlated with their social capital measures. The power-diversity index and powertie-diversity index serve as indicators of power and influence of an individual's ability to control communication and information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis shows that productivity, as measured by billable revenue, is more associated with information diversity than with social communication. However, the opposite is true for job security.

Design/methodology/approach - The author conducted theoretical and simulation research. Agent-based technology is employed to construct an agent dynamics agent-based model that simulates and explains how an individual initiates the evolution of a knowledge network through knowledge transfer activities. Findings - The results demonstrate that the two mechanisms can improve the knowledge levels of the network members; the exchange mechanism is more efficient as it can improve the values of both sides. Individual knowledge transfer networks evolve from random networks to small-world networks. Research limitations/implications - The research model must include more variables. Computer simulation research will be cross-confirmed by other research methods in future studies. Practical implications - Individual knowledge transfer networks form and subsequently evolve as a result of social interaction. The research findings will contribute to the policy making for knowledge management in organizations.

Such ties are formed irrespective of the organizational boundaries and formal structures and known as ego-centered networks of professionals. Ego-centered knowledge networks have not been recognised as efficient means of acquiring work-specific knowledge in the knowledge management literature. Research is needed to understand how ego-centric knowledge networks provide ready access to work-specific knowledge that can help professionals to solve complex problems and improve performance at work. Using theories of social capital and social exchange, we try to answer questions what role ego-centered networks play in coordinating work-specific knowledge and how do professionals collaborate to share knowledge in the absence of organisational control mechanisms. Data is collected through a questionnaire survey from 342 individuals working in a variety of professions and industry sectors in New Zealand. Questions were asked to find the existence of ego-centred knowledge networks around professionals and the use of this network to acquire work-specific knowledge.

This research draws on the literature on formal modeling of networks to examine the interaction between knowledge codification and knowledge-sharing networks. The analysis suggests that an increase in codification may damage existing network-sharing ties. Anticipating that, individuals may hoard their knowledge to protect their network ties, even when there are nontrivial rewards for codification. We find that despite the aforementioned tension between the codification and the network approach, a firm may still benefit from combining the two approaches. Specifically, when the future sharing potential between knowledge workers is high, a combination of the two approaches may outperform a codification-only or a network-only approach because the codification reward causes fewer network ties to break down, and the benefit from increased codification can offset the loss of some network ties. However, when the future sharing potential is low, an increase in codification reward can quickly break down the whole network. Thus, firms may be better off by pursuing a codification-only or a network-only strategy.",,,,"Wang, Charles/B-5565-2011","Wang, Charles/0000-0001-9331-8437; Liu, De/0000-0002-9430-9732",,,,,,,,,,,,1047-7047,,,,,DEC,2010,21,4,,,,,892,906,,10.1287/isre.1080.0217,,,,,,,WOS:000285383200018,,,,,J,"Xu, YJ; Kim, HW; Kankanhalli, A",,,,"Xu, Yunjie (Calvin); Kim, Hee-Woong; Kankanhalli, Atreyi",,,Task and Social Information Seeking: Whom Do We Prefer and Whom Do We Approach?,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Employee information-seeking behavior shapes the formation of organizational communication networks and affects performance.

Deriving from the relational communication perspective, informational and relational motivations are modeled as the two main antecedents of source preference and sourcing frequency in dyadic information seeking. Through a survey of employee dyads, our findings indicate that perceived information relevance is a significant antecedent of source preference for both task and social information seeking, whereas perceived relational benefit is significant in the context of task information. The results also show that perceived relational benefit has a stronger effect on source preference in task information seeking than in social information seeking. Furthermore, preference for a source is a significant antecedent of the frequency of sourcing in both contexts.

Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical model was tested through a survey carried out on 152 MBA students of a university in east China, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed for data analysis. Findings - This research proved that both instrumental and expressive ties will facilitate trust and knowledge transfer. Cognition-based trust is not essential when low-tacit, general knowledge is transferred, and the effect of the expressive tie becomes negative when trust is controlled. When transferring general knowledge the instrumental tie is more efficient. However, contrary to the hypothesis, it is found that the effect of the expressive tie is not significantly larger than that of the instrumental tie during the tacit knowledge transfer process. Research limitations/implications - Besides tacitness, future research may consider involving more dimensions of knowledge into the theoretical model. Longitudinal and cross-national studies are also needed. Practical implications - The paper suggests that managers can enhance knowledge transfer among co-workers by enhancing their instrumental and expressive ties. However overuse of the expressive tie is risky The importance of trust construction in organizations is also underscored.

A behavioral study found that some social relationships (e.g., competence, benevolence) are most likely to affect a recipient's advice-taking decision.

The virtual competency exhibited by individuals can be the key to overcoming the constraints of knowledge transfers with such characteristics because underlying competency can facilitate effective action in unfamiliar and novel situations. In this conceptual research, we develop a theoretical model of individual virtual competence and describe its role in the communication process, which underpins effective knowledge transfer in virtual settings.

To investigate how PHAs and their friends/family members acquire and share network-mediated HIV/AIDS information, semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted in three rural regions of Canada.

Findings revealed that participants obtained HIV/AIDS information from their networks through five interactive processes: joint seeking, tag-team seeking, exposure, opportunity, and legitimation.

We find major differences ill file patterns of mobility between the pure and the transfer sciences. Pure scientists tend to move via a postdoctoral appointment, whereas transfer scientists tend to change job positions. We find that international postdoctoral mobility is positively correlated with publications for non Job-mobile pure scientists in a five-year period starting two years after completion of the PhD, and with the total number of citations. The explanation is that weak institutional ties connected with postdoctoral fellowships give researchers access to institutions with higher reputation, which in turn gives access to valuable knowledge and networks. This institutional advantage means that international postdoctoral mobility has a positive influence on academic performance. The lack of significance of the correlation between precocity and international postdoctoral mobility makes it impossible to determine whether international postdoctoral mobility is a non-early advantage with positive effects on a scientist's productivity and career development.",,,,"Fernandez-Zubieta, Ana/L-7515-2014","Fernandez-Zubieta, Ana/0000-0002-1743-2331",,,,,,,,,,,,0958-2029,,,,,JUN,2009,18,2,,,,,105,115,,10.3152/095820209X443446,,,,,,,WOS:000267095300003,,,,,J,"Yang, LY; Morris, SA; Barden, EM",,,,"Yang, Liying; Morris, Steven A.; Barden, Elizabeth M.",,,Mapping institutions and their weak ties in a specialty: A case study of cystic fibrosis body composition research,SCIENTOMETRICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"The paper demonstrates visualization technique that show the collaboration structure of institutions in the specialty and the researchers that function as weak ties among them.

Enticing employees to seek knowledge from KMS remains an important concern for researchers and practitioners. Trust has been widely recognized in many studies as an important enabling factor for seeking knowledge; however, the role of trust in promoting knowledge-seeking behavior using KMS has not been adequately addressed. Drawing upon the extant literature on trust and information technology adoption, this article examines the relationships between the knowledge seekers' trust in the community of KMS users, their perceptions toward the system (perceived usefulness and perceived seeking efforts), and the intention to continually use the KMS. The results reveal that trust in the community of KMS users does not directly affect the employees' knowledge-seeking continuance intention; rather, it happens indirectly through a mediated effect of perceived usefulness of the KMS. Furthermore, we find that trust seems to be a stronger determinant of perceived usefulness than of perceived seeking efforts. Our study thus demonstrates the indirect, but still crucial, role of trust in knowledge-seeking behavior in the context of corporate KMS usage.

Findings - The data highlight that effective knowledge transfer between E&E units depends on a combination of key drivers, such as social network ties, absorptive capacity, learning adaptiveness, and communication channels. The findings suggest that the search for and transfer of knowledge depends foremost on the applicability of context-specific knowledge rather than its complexity.

Also, the findings were drawn from a limited sample of In-depth practitioner interviews and did not integrate any outcome measures to successful knowledge transfer in their approach. Practical implications - The paper offers guidelines for firms and specifically E&E managers to observe the specificity of knowledge and how this affects its limited applicability for other identical units.

Design/methodology/approach - The research design is based on a case study methodology, In particular, two actual technology districts are analyzed, namely Castel Romano and Toulouse, in order to show how they use organizational, and cognitive proximity to acquire external knowledge sources and re-shape their geographical boundaries. Findings - Based on the findings of the empirical study, two main propositions are formulated. The first proposition refers to the negative relationship between the geographical distance to the district actors and the use of organizational proximity as a means for reaching external knowledge sources. By contrast, the second proposition indicates the positive relationship between the geographical distance to the districts actors and the use of cognitive proximity as a means for reaching external knowledge sources. Research limitations/implications - As regards the firm strategic behaviors, it seems particularly crucial to exploit all the three dimensions of proximity, in order to guarantee openness and sustain innovativeness and competitiveness. Concerning policy implications, the local governments should address their actions to help and promote the openness of technology districts and the formation of technology clusters. With this aim, actions should be devoted also to sustaining single local firms that are part of a technology cluster but not of a technology district. These, in fact, by increasing their competitive position, may generate positive externalities in the local area, fostering the diffusion and sharing of knowledge in the area and, then, acting as knowledge gatekeepers for the whole area.

The relations that exist along members of the VCOP, the existing strength between their ties in their social network as well as the relations of support (to share knowledge with respect to its processes) that they have, are analyzed in this paper.

In order to obtain the data of the members of the VCOP a questionnaire divided in three different sections was design and applied to 30 people in charge of the human resources area. Each of these people belongs to one of 30 different campus of the organization that are distributed in five different zones around the country. We use the social networks approach to analyze the data. Our findings show that the relationships, information and knowledge that participants of the VCOP have, depend on their geographic location. We can infer then that a clusterization in the distribution of the information and knowledge exists. In this sense, it is a fact that all members of the network do not participate in a similar way and they do not contribute uniformly with his knowledge. The data reveal that strategic positions exist along the network and that particular members that occupy those positions represent a detonating that promotes participation. A significant difference exists along the participation of network members although this network member's participation is foster in a similar way. Another important finding that our study shows is the existence of a correlation between the support that a member of the VCOP offers to other members of the community and the people who this member knows. The results indicate strong support for the fact that the greater number of members of the VCOP somebody knows in a face to face relationship, the more support this member will give to them.

Effective knowledge transfer across projects avoids reinventions, enhances knowledge creation and saves lots of time that is crucial in project environment. In order to facilitate knowledge transfer, many PBOs have invested lots of financial and human resources to implement IT-based knowledge repository. However, some empirical studies found that employees would rather turn for knowledge to colleagues despite their ready access to IT-based knowledge repository. Therefore, it is apparent that social networks play a pivotal role in the knowledge transfer across projects. Some scholars attempt to explore the effect of network structure on knowledge transfer and performance, however, focused only on egocentric networks and the groups' internal social networks. It has been found that the project's external social network is also critical, in that the team members can not handle critical situations and accomplish the projects on time without the assistance and knowledge from external sources. To date, the influence of the structure of a project team's internal and external social networks on project performance, and the interrelation between both networks are barely known. In order to obtain such knowledge, this paper explores the interrelation between the structure of a project team's internal and external social networks, and their effect on the project team's performance.

We argue that this conceptualization does not adequately represent most organizations today, in which multiple users interact with multiple information systems within a group. Relying heavily on the theory and methods behind social network analysis, we introduce the concept of multimodal networks to assess both users and information systems as equivalent nodes in a single social network. This perspective allows us to examine the influence of information systems on organizational outcomes as a function of all of the user-system and interpersonal interactions in a group. We explore two different possible mechanisms for this influence: (1) direct user-system interactions by aggregating the strength of all the dyadic user-system interactions in a group, and (2) indirect user-system interactions by assessing the centrality of the information systems within the social network. We survey approximately 600 individuals in 40 healthcare groups to test whether either or both of these mechanisms are associated with two types of organizational performance outcomes-efficiency and quality of care. We find that the centrality of the information systems within the network is significantly and positively associated with both efficiency and quality outcomes, but that the average strength of the user-system interactions is not.

After examining these two streams of research in parallel, we suggest that ( 1) the perceived relationship between CMC and organizational form runs through knowledge transfer and (2) organizational form in turn drives additional changes in the use of CMC. In other words, the impact of CMC on organizational form is not necessarily direct and can be better understood by interjecting knowledge transfer as an intermediate step. In addition, changes in organizational form can be seen as looping back to impact CMC thus creating a cycle. This paper describes and justifies what we refer to as the CMC Impact Cycle-the flow of organizational change moving from CMC to knowledge transfer to organizational form and back to CMC.",,,,"Schwartz, David G./E-5836-2010","Schwartz, David G./0000-0002-2125-2069",,,,,,,,,,,,1554-6152,,978-0-7656-1637-1,,,,2008,12,,,,,,145,162,,,,,,,,,WOS:000288748900009,,,,,J,"Dolfsma, W",,,,"Dolfsma, Wilfred",,,"Making Knowledge Work: Intra-firm Networks, Gifts, and Innovation",KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION,,,,,,,,,,,,"Exchanging knowledge between individuals working in a firm, between but even within divisions, does not occur automatically (Szulanski 1996).

As a firm's competitive advantage closely related to its innovative capacity, however, largely based on how it uses knowledge that is already available, the question then is: How does knowledge flow within a firm? What can be done to stimulate or re-direct knowledge flow within a firm? In recent years, increasing attention is given, by scholars in social sciences in general and in management in particular, to the networks of relations between individuals within firms involved in knowledge transfer and development. Consultancies too are scrambling to set up units that can analyze these networks for firms. in addition to the structural issue of who relates how to whom, I will argue that there is a need to look at why relations are established and maintained.

One of the most important implications of these changes is the expansion of resources and products that are globally tradable, highlighting the importance of knowledge as the key economic resource of lasting competitive advantage. As a consequence of this shift in the economy, an increasing number of industries are moving from the closed innovation model to the open innovation model that created porous boundaries between the innovative company and its surrounding environment, changing the inter- and intra-organizational modes of coordination. In an environment where knowledge is the key economic resource and the open innovation model is applied in more and more industries, we are experiencing the increasing importance of the New Technology-Based Firm (NTBF). NTBFs face a number of difficulties mainly associated with a lack of resources and entrepreneurial skills and in order overcome the difficulties NTBFs strive towards flexibility while accelerating the development and commercialization processes by creating and/or entering business networks. By adopting a knowledge-based view for NTBFs and consequently placing knowledge in the centre of a systemic innovation model, knowledge networks constitute an asset for NTBFs. As this new form of cooperation takes multiple and often unpredictable forms it is thus essential to develop strategy formulation tools and processes that can help NTBFs to face their challenges. Until now little attention has been given to the development of strategy tools and processes tailored for the requirements of NTBFs. The present paper presents a concept to cope with NTBFs' by developing a generic process for strategy formulation. In this respect, an action research project was initiated. The proposed concept was initially designed, although not exclusively, for a Greek NTBF, Astrofos Ltd. The author, who is coordinator of the incubator where Astrofos is sited, is acting as-a strategy consultant for the firm and has taken part in all its major decisions since summer 2007. In order to build the strategy formulation process, this paper proposes a mapping technique that attempts to depict a NTBF's tangible and intangible transactions as well as the strength of ties between the focal NTBF and its partners and the complexity of the knowledge. In developing the mapping technique, we have used a combination of the concept of weak ties, derived from social network analysis, with the notion of complex knowledge, as this combination was initially proposed by Hansen (1999). Additionally, a set of questions is proposed that have to be answered in order to pass from knowledge identification to knowledge transfer, from a strategic point of view. In this regard, the presented methodology constitutes an effort, on the one hand, to study the emergent patterns in what is considered to be a chaotic or disordered system and, on the other, to stimulate the creation of new patterns in the system that would be consistent with the NTBF's strategy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-906638-16-0,,,,2008,,,,,,,279,287,,,,,,,,,WOS:000260973300032,,,,,B,"Bettoni, M; Schiller, G; Bernhard, W",,"Harorimana, D; Watkins, D",,"Bettoni, Marco; Schiller, Gabriele; Bernhard, Willi",,,Weak ties cooperation in the CoRe knowledge network,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,,,,,9th European Conference on Knowledge Management,"SEP 04-05, 2008","Southampton Sloent Univ, Southampton, ENGLAND",,Southampton Sloent Univ,,,"How to implement a collaborative knowledge strategy under conditions of weak ties? This paper will first explain how came that we faced this question in the research department of our university, then tell the story of how we are answering it by means of a new kind of knowledge network called ""CoRe"" and finally reflect on lessons we are learning about weak ties cooperation. The Swiss Distance University of Applied Sciences is organized in a radically decentralized way combined with traditional hierarchical structures and functional divisions. This has led to an insufficient level of interactions between geographically distributed university members (academic staff, students) so that weak ties have become the norm. In research one major consequence was that research activities were too much isolated in the departments, human resources were dispersed and research knowledge did not flow enough. Projects were small and less recognised, know how got easily lost and research tools' development was too slow. How to meet the challenge of improving research performances under conditions of weak ties like these? Our approach consisted in a collaborative knowledge strategy: to create and cultivate CoRe, an intra-organizational knowledge network of researchers (academic staff, students) organized as a community of practice connecting its members around the common task of stewarding research knowledge. This paper provides first an overview of how we are designing, implementing and cultivating the CoRe knowledge network and then reflections on the new subject of weak ties cooperation as realized in CoRe. In the first part, after introducing the background of the CoRe project as well as our approach to knowledge cooperation we will present the development process and focus on the evolution of the network requirements by comparing the initial and a revised version. In both cases these requirements were collaboratively developed by the network members in two large events: a) the network launch, a future search event (June 2006) and b) the 1(st) Annual CoRe Conference (June 2007). Based on an analysis of the evolution between these two versions, in the second part our paper will provide reflections and key lessons learned about how to design and implement a collaborative knowledge strategy which is able to foster knowledge cooperation under conditions of weak ties.

This paper finds that how matters become subjects of decision-making is at least as important part of municipal decision-making as how they are formally decided on. Both the progression of the process and the actual content of the decisions are largely resolved in preparation. The complex and rapidly changing operational environment is imposing special requirements, which are driving the municipal sector implementing new kinds of patterns. The paper deems it important that, alongside effective issues, municipal administration also strives to transcend conventional truths, search for new ideas from various non-interrelated sources, and create new possibilities from them. The paper engages with the knowledge management research tradition because the success of municipality is considered to be dependent on how efficiently the municipality can balance knowledge exploitation with knowledge exploration. Rather than focusing on administrative structures, the paper concentrates on the official and unofficial interaction processes within the preparation system, and between the preparation system and its environment, The paper finds that the interaction processes have hidden potential, which can be translated into a resource for balancing effectiveness and innovativeness. The resulting complexity-based framework, which can be seen as the main contribution of this paper, shows that paying attention to the interrelationships between the various actors and invisible dynamics of the preparation system provides a new perspective on the challenges facing municipal preparatory work. The complexity-based framework can be seen as an 'enabling structure' that facilitates the running of the preparation system and simultaneously ensures the co-evolution between the preparation system and the surrounding environment. This framework consists of five dimensions, which are: (i) interaction and feedback, (ii) trust, (iii) internal mechanisms, (iv) diversity, and (v) sense of timing and coevolution. The complexity-based framework helps to understand how municipal communities can benefit from their internal and external knowledge reserves and adapt to changes in the operating environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-906638-10-8,,,,2008,,,,,,,333,340,,,,,,,,,WOS:000259556500038,,,,,B,"Miyamoto, T; Hattori, Y; Yatera, A",,"Harorimana, D; Watkins, D",,"Miyamoto, Takuya; Hattori, Yasuhiro; Yatera, Akiyuki",,,The relation of rotation and knowledge transfer: A study of the R&D activities of a Japanese manufacturer,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,,,,,9th European Conference on Knowledge Management,"SEP 04-05, 2008","Southampton Sloent Univ, Southampton, ENGLAND",,Southampton Sloent Univ,,,"Japanese manufacturers have competitive strength particularly in the electronics and automobile industries.

In order to investigate the origin of this competitive strength pertaining to knowledge, which is evident in Japanese manufacturers, this paper sheds light on the rotation of personnel with regard to the research and development of forefront technology. We procured the rotation data of all the engineers (N = 1350) assigned to the central research institutes of a Japanese manufacturer. The central research institutes consisted of the material, mechatronics, e-component, and multimedia research institutes. In addition to utilizing this quantitative data, we interviewed the R&D director of the company who was familiar with all of its R&D activities. First, we analysed each research institute in 1998 based on the following criteria, and subsequently analysed each engineer's rotation term: (1) the number of engineers who had worked in the planning departments, (2) the number of engineers who had worked in the basic research institute, and (3) the number of engineers who had worked in the product development departments. Furthermore, based on the data obtained from the interviews, we were able to infer as follows. First, engineers from the planning departments play an important role in accessing the expertise of other organizations. Second, engineers from the basic research institute play a significant role in evaluating external expertise by utilizing the professional networks to which they belonged in the basic research institute. Finally, engineers from the product development departments play a crucial role in adapting the research in forefront technology to the market needs. The rotation of personnel facilitates knowledge transfer. This is because the rotated personnel bring with them new values, ideas, knowledge, and networks. In this paper, we discuss an adequate rotation policy by analysing two successful and unsuccessful research institutes. Our research subject was a large Japanese manufacturer. We revealed that the successful research institutes conducted adequate knowledge transfer through adequate rotation. Japanese manufacturers are well known as high-performance knowledge-sharing companies with strong networks.

In the market, users can access a repository of knowledge for a single price (repository pricing) or knowledge items in the repository can be sold individually (knowledge pricing). However, users have been found to prefer repository pricing but not the knowledge in the repository. This irrationality can cause market failure because users derive a suboptimal level of utility from the knowledge repository, and vendors have contradictory pricing and knowledge strategies. We empirically examine a joint explanation from two competing theoretical perspectives that accounts for this inconsistency nicely: The mental accounting perspective endorses repository pricing because it entices users with the benefits of the whole repository, whereas the transaction decoupling perspective finds expression in individually priced knowledge because it prevents the discrete benefit of knowledge from becoming obscure. By integrating the two theoretical perspectives and considering price, knowledge, and user characteristics simultaneously, the results offer important implications for the market transfer of knowledge.

The purpose of this study is to explore the health information seeking behaviour of African-Americans using Granovetter's strength of weak ties as the theoretical framework. Method. A listed household telephone survey of 216 residents who reside on the Near East Side of Buffalo, New York. Using the Rand() feature in MS Excel a random sample was drawn from the telephone numbers randomly selected from census tracts covering the target area. Random samples were drawn three times until at least 200 telephone surveys were completed. Analysis. Data analysis was completed using SPSS 13.0 for Windows. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed along with analysing descriptive statistics and the chi-squared test to determine the association between the source of health information as related to demographics and tie strength between individuals. Results. Overall, most respondents rely on a health service professional for health information followed by a web site. Respondents reported having a 'somewhat close' relationship with health care professionals as compared to having a 'very close' relationship with family members. The importance of health service professionals as a significant or weak tie in health information seeking is consistent with the strength of weak ties theory. Results on proxy searching behaviour or searching on behalf of another person are also examined. Most respondents sought information for themselves, although 22.2 percent sought health information on behalf of another person. Conclusions. These findings confirm the important role of health service professionals in health information seeking by under-served populations and suggest the need for investigation on the information giving behaviour of these professionals. These findings also demonstrate the need for further research on strong ties or close family and friends as a source of health information, in particular their role in proxy health information behaviour.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1368-1613,,,,,JAN,2007,12,2,,,,,,,297,,,,,,,,WOS:000243687300010,,,,,B,"Yang, L; Morris, SA; Barden, EM",,"TorresSalinas, D; Moed, HF",,"Yang, Liying; Morris, Steven A.; Barden, Elizabeth M.",,,Mapping institutions and their weak ties in a research specialty: A case study of cystic fibrosis body composition research,"PROCEEDINGS OF ISSI 2007: 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR SCIENTOMETRICS AND INFORMETRICS, VOLS I AND II",,,,,11th International Conference of the International-Society-for-Scientometrics-and-Informetrics,"JUN 25-27, 2007","Madrid, SPAIN","Int Soc Scientometr & Informetr, CSIC, Minist Educ & Ciencia, FECYT, Comunidad Madrid, Eugene Garfield Fdn, Thomson, Elsevier, Journal Informetr, Scopus, Ayuntamiento Madrid, Sci Metrix, Univ Carlos III Madrid",,,,"Using a collection of papers gathered from the Web of Science on the topic of cystic fibrosis body composition research. we demonstrate analysis and visualization methods that show the collaboration structure of institutions in the specialty and the researchers that function as weak ties among them.

This paper attempts to address the relationship between the appropriation of new technology and the process of unlearning. We investigate why and how the actions modifying old knowledge can favour the use of collaborative and virtual technology. The framework of the paper is built on a review of Giddens's theory of structuration and learning theories, with particular focus on the concept of unlearning (Nystrom and Starbuck 1984). Unlearning is defined as the questioning and destruction process of knowledge, logic and patterns established, in order to propose new responses and behaviours. The empirical study proposes the analysis of the process appropriation of wiki technology by 300 students in a French business school [""Euromed Marseille""] in their workgroup sessions. We use a case study methodology (Eisenhardt 1989, Yin 1990) based on a qualitative investigation (Miles and Huberman 1984) and a combination of different collection. The results show that unlearning of traditional workgroup methods clearly facilitates appropriation of wiki technology. In other words, the unlearning-learning process appears to be essential to create virtual collective knowledge. Furthermore, this research provides some evidence about the factors that influence the speed of unlearning - deviant behaviours and tensions within groups, weak ties among group members, various expertise and visions, flexible collaboration...

This is due to the greater ability of such communities to organize and mobilize effectively for collective action because they have high levels of social trust, dense social networks, and well-established norms of mutuality (the major features of social capital). Communities with ""bridging"" social capital (weak ties across groups) as well as ""bonding"" social capital (strong ties within groups) are the most effective in organizing for collective action. People who belong to multiple groups act as bridging ties. When people with bridging ties use communication media, such as the Internet, they enhance their capability to educate community members and to organize, as needed, for collective action. This article summarizes evidence from stratified household survey data in Blacksburg, VA, showing that people with weak (bridging) ties across groups have higher levels of community involvement, civic interest, and collective efficacy than people without bridging ties among groups. Moreover, heavy Internet users with bridging ties have higher social engagement, use the Internet for social purposes, and have been attending more local meetings and events since going online than heavy Internet users with no bridging ties. These findings may suggest that the Internet-in the hands of bridging individuals is a tool for enhancing social relations and information exchange, and for increasing face-to-face interaction, all of which help to build both bonding and bridging social capital in communities.",,,,"Wang, Charles/B-5565-2011; Carroll, John/A-8718-2009","Wang, Charles/0000-0001-9331-8437; Carroll, John/0000-0001-5189-337X",,,,,,,,,,,,0197-2243,,,,,APR-JUN,2005,21,2,,,,,119,131,,10.1080/01972240590925320,,,,,,,WOS:000227986800004,,,,,J,"Kazmer, MM",,,,"Kazmer, MM",,,Community-embedded learning,LIBRARY QUARTERLY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Online learners often stay located in, and tied to, their communities, kinship networks, households, and workplaces.

It is argued from the research literature and studies by the author that where ties are strong, communicators can influence each other to adapt and expand their use of media to support the exchanges important to their tie, but where ties are weak, communicators are dependent on common, organizationally established means of communication and protocols established by others. Due to this differential use of media, a new medium that adds means and opportunities for previously unconnected others to communicate will have positive effects on weak ties and weak-tie networks, in particular by laying an infrastructure of latent ties (ones that exist technically but have not yet been activated), and providing an opportunity for weak ties to develop and strengthen. A new medium may also have positive effects on strongly tied pairs where it adds another means of communicating and supports the communication needs and tasks of the pair. However, where a new medium replaces a former, common means of communication, the dependence of weak ties on a common medium makes weak-tie networks highly susceptible to dissolution. In contrast, strong-tie networks, with their connections via multiple relations and multiple media, can be expected to be more robust under conditions of change.",,,,,"Haythornthwaite, Caroline/0000-0002-7311-3140",,,,,,,,,,,,0197-2243,,,,,OCT-DEC,2002,18,5,,,,,385,401,,10.1080/01972240290108195,,,,,,,WOS:000179443900006,,,,,J,"Haythornthwaite, C",,,,"Haythornthwaite, C",,,Exploring multiplexity: Social network structures in a computer-supported distance learning class,INFORMATION SOCIETY,,,,,Conference of the Association-for-Library-and-Information-Science-Educators,"JAN, 1999","PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA",Assoc Lib Informat Sci Educators,,,,"A computer-mediated group is a complex entity whose members exchange many types of information via multiple means of communication in pursuit of goals specific to their environment.

To explore this complex interaction, a case study is presented of the social networks of interactions and media use among members of a class of computer-supported distance learners. Results show how group structures associated with project teams dominated who communicated with whom, about what, and via which media over the term, and how media came to occupy their own communication niches: Webboard for diffuse class-wide communication; Internet Relay Chat more to named others but still for general communication across the class; and e-mail primarily for intrateam communication. Face-to-face interaction, occurring only during a short on-campus session, appears to have had a catalytic effect on social and emotional exchanges.

Analysis of observation and interview data revealed that nurses were, indeed, bridging weak ties--who played an important role in linking seniors with local services, because they provided HSI in a caring manner that seniors associated with strong ties. Although nurses were not always aware of their HSI-giving role and referral behavior, they used various techniques to identify seniors' needs and often used strategies to persuade clients to use their information. Among other findings were ""missed opportunities"" and affective aspects of information giving. Seniors reported using HSI in ways that differed from what nurses intended, which suggests that information helps in indirect ways.

Using ordered logit and sequential logit models, our results show that in the adoption process, households benefit from weak ties of social groups such as religious group and informal saving group for the adoption of mobile money. We equally find that being client of banks or microfinance institutions act as powerful channels from one step to another in the process. Besides, our findings reveal that households whoever use mobile money seem to be more resilient to climatic shocks such as drought, irregular rain, soil degradation, erosion and fertility reduction and to shock that affect households' assets (non-climatic: high prices of agricultural inputs). However, the picture is more contrasted when the individuals are classified by disadvantaged groups such as rural people, women, less educated and people with low incomes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-6846,1466-4283,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/00036846.2019.1659496,,Sep-19,,,,,WOS:000486770100001,,,,,J,"Peiro-Palomino, J",,,,"Peiro-Palomino, Jesus",,,The geography of social capital and innovation in the European Union,PAPERS IN REGIONAL SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper assesses the role of the associational activity dimension of social capital in regional innovation for 257 EU 28 regions in the pre-crisis (2000-2007) and the crisis (2008-2012) period.

In this study, we demonstrate that social networks and policy makers may use an IT-facilitated intervention-displaying things in common (TIC) between users (mutual hometown, interest, education, work, city)-to encourage friendship formation, especially among people who are different from each other. Displaying TIC may update an individual's belief about the shared similarity with another and reduce information friction that may be hard to overcome in offline communication. In collaboration with an online social network, we design and implement a randomized field experiment, which randomly varies the prominence of different types of things in common information when a user (viewer) is browsing a non-friend's profile. The dyad-level exogenous variation, orthogonal to any (un)observed structural factors in viewer-profile's network, allows us to cleanly isolate the role of individuals' preference for TIC in driving network formation and homophily. We find that displaying TIC to viewers may significantly increase their probability of sending a friend request and forming a friendship, and is especially effective for pairs of people who have little in common. Such findings suggest that information intervention is a very effective and zero-cost approach to encourage the formation of weak ties, and also provide the first experimental evidence on the crucial role of individuals' preference (versus structural embeddedness) in network formation. We further demonstrate that displaying TIC could improve friendship formation for a wide range of viewers with different demographics and friendship status, and is more effective when the TIC information is more surprising to the viewer. Our study offers actionable insights to social networks and policy makers on the design of information intervention to encourage friendship formation and improve the diversity of the friendship, at both an aggregate and an individual level.

While some of our findings support previous work, others challenge previous research and general expectations about race and crime. Contrary to victimization patterns observed in the aggregate data, our panel data models identify consistent patterns of reported violence committed by White individuals against Blacks and Hispanics across neighborhoods. Specifically, in the presence of controls for neighborhood and time effects, Whites are more likely to assault and use weapons against Blacks and Hispanics than Blacks and Hispanics are to assault or use weapons against Whites. On the other hand, Blacks and Hispanics are typically more likely to commit robbery (crimes which we characterize as being often related to economic motives) against Whites than the reverse. We estimate these effects across the racial composition and earnings distribution of neighborhoods in Los Angeles County and find significant heterogeneity in the propensity for certain types of crimes to occur as a function of the race/ethnic match of suspect and victim.

Using agent-based models, we find that when organizational identification is high, external change agents who attempt to direct organizations by introducing policy aligned messages (e.g., professional development emphasizing specific teaching practices) may unintentionally contribute to divergence in practice and polarization in networks, inhibiting full implementation of the desired practices as well as reducing organizational capacity to absorb new practices.

It aims to add new fieldwork results and interpretations to the lacuna of studies on the interrelations between faith and migration. Most publications show the specificity of Roma economic activities in the context of their migratory movements, but the role of religious network and its social commitment is a less analysed issue. Roma migrants have different religious profile and are Orthodox Christians, Muslims, or Evangelical Christians. Bearing in mind the religious landscapes in Bulgaria and Spain, which are predominantly Orthodox or Catholic, respectively, all migrant workers have left from an Orthodox home country and settled in a Catholic destination country. The text examines Roma mobility from the early 1990s until today. While settling in Spain, Roma/Gypsies present themselves to Spanish people as Bulgarians' and they are often recognised by them in this way. In the period prior to Bulgaria's accession to the European Union in 2007 most Roma migrants had no residence or work permits or neither. In some cases, they benefited from the services of the ""Caritas' Catholic organisation. However, they are not influenced by Catholicism as a faith and have only pragmatic aims in using its services. In this dynamic context, the social ties created on the basis of joining a particular religious community acquire importance for Evangelical believers, unlike the Orthodox Christians and the Muslims who rely on their family contacts mostly. Evangelical networks have a double accumulation effect and the believers employ both bridging and bonding social ties in producing their religious and social commitment. However, the social potential of the Evangelical networks is not fully used by Roma migrants in Spain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-0942,1470-9325,,,,MAR,2018,33,2,,,,,224,241,,10.1177/0269094218762458,,,,,,,WOS:000432096600007,,,,,J,"Crescenzi, R; Di Cataldo, M; Faggian, A",,,,"Crescenzi, Riccardo; Di Cataldo, Marco; Faggian, Alessandra",,,"Internationalized at work and localistic at home: The ""split' Europeanization behind Brexit",PAPERS IN REGIONAL SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,This paper looks at the results of the referendum on the United Kingdom membership to the European Union in order to test the link between the internationalization of the local economy and the openness of the local society as factors associated with the Leave vote (Brexit).

Design/methodology/approach The study employed a cross-sectional research design and data were collected from a total of 400 poor households located in Northern, Eastern, Central and Western Uganda. The authors adopted ordinary least square hierarchical regression analysis to test for the predictive power of each of the dimensions of social network in explaining financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. The effects were determined by calculating the significant change in coefficient of determination (R-2) between the dimensions of social network in explaining financial inclusion. In addition, analysis of variance was also used to test for variation in perceptions of the poor about being financially included. Findings The findings revealed that the dimensions of ties and interaction significantly explain financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. Contrary to previous studies, the results indicated that interdependence as a dimension of social network is not a significant predictor of financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. Combined together, the dimensions of social network explains about 16.6 percent of the variation in financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. Research limitations/implications The study was purely cross-sectional, thus, ignoring longitudinal survey design, which could have investigated certain characteristics of the variable over time. Additionally, although a total sample amounting to 400 poor households was used in the study, the results cannot be generalized since other equally marginalized groups such as the disabled persons, refugees, and immigrants were not included in this study. Furthermore, the study used only the questionnaire to elicit responses from the respondents. The use of interview was ignored during data collection. Practical implications Policy makers, managers of financial institutions, and financial inclusion advocates should consider social network dimensions of ties and interaction as conduits for information flow and sharing among the poor including the women and youth about scarce financial resources like loans. Advocacy towards creation of societal network that brings the poor together in strong and weak ties is very important in scaling up access to and use of scarce financial services for improving economic and social well-being. Originality/value Contrary to previous studies, this particular study test the predictive power of each of the dimensions of social network in explaining financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. Thus, it methodologically isolates the individual contribution of each of the dimensions of social network in explaining financial inclusion of the poor. The authors found that only ties and interaction are significant predictors of financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda.

High-ability workers are more productive and have a larger number of professional contacts. Firms can choose between a vacancy in the regular market and a job opening in the referral market. The model predicts that a larger number of social contacts is associated with a larger wage gap between high-and low-ability workers and a larger difference in the unemployment rates. The net welfare gain of referrals is estimated at 1.2%. There are three reasons for the inefficiency of the decentralized equilibrium. First is the traditional search externality described by Hosios. Second, firms share their profits with workers, whereas the social optimum implies that full surplus should be given to firms in the referral market. This inefficiency can be internalized by means of referral subsidies. Third, there is the ""pooling inefficiency"" in the regular market. If high-ability workers are sufficiently more productive they impose a positive externality on low-ability workers and should be rewarded by positive transfers. On the contrary, if productivity differences are small, high-ability workers achieve unreasonably high wages by referring each other and reduce employment chances of low-ability workers. In this latter case, high-ability workers should be penalized.

Building on the search-theoretic career choice and job mobility model proposed by Neal (1999), I compare the consequences of career advice by one's weak ties versus that by strong ties. The main result is that receiving help from weak ties is associated with early career and job settlements, while the strong ties are more likely to lead to amplified mobility and generate mismatch. Given a network size, I find a strongly positive correlation between the fraction of weak ties among one's informal connections and the likelihood of settling on a stable career path early in the life course. I also find that the sign of this correlation persists, while the magnitude gets smaller as the network size increases. I conclude that the strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis can shed light on the complexity of job mobility patterns among young workers. The model can explain why it takes much longer for blacks-whose informal networks are documented to consist of strong ties-to locate a stable career path than their white counterparts. It also predicts that young workers from closed and segregated neighborhoods tend to spend more time before they find suitable careers.

Based on data drawn from China General Social Survey, we find that disadvantaged job seekers rely primarily on informal channels; whereas experienced and better-educated job seekers tend to search for jobs through formal channels. However, those reaping the largest benefit from using networks are the job seekers who are able to use formal and informal channels jointly. By disaggregating the whole sample, we further find that the promoting effect of network use is contingent on factors such as gender and types of jobs. Network use brings about larger benefits to female and job seekers target to prestigious occupations. Finally, it appears that whether a job seeker can receive influential help depends primarily on the social status of the contacts rather than their tie strength. The results of our paper thus urge us to examine the combination of different searching strategies rather than studying them separately. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Knowledge search is an issue of concern for Chinese firms because many firms generally have relatively weak research and development (R&D) and innovation capabilities that cannot support innovative development through mere internal innovations. This study examines the interactive effects of network centrality, structural holes, and knowledge tacitness when formal knowledge search depth (FKSD) affects innovation performance from the perspective of formal/informal knowledge search. A survey of 161 firms in China suggests that FKSD positively affects innovation performance, and the effect is positively moderated by network centrality. Given high knowledge tacitness, FKSD is more effective in fostering innovation performance when firms' network centrality is higher. Furthermore, high knowledge tacitness results in rich structural holes negatively moderating the effect of FKSD on innovation performance, whereas low tacitness generates a positive moderating role. This indicates that Chinese firms may consider using more formal search channels to increase external knowledge search depth and to dynamically adjust the depth of such a formal search or the mode of network structural embeddedness according to the degree of knowledge tacitness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1976-1597,2158-6721,,,,,2017,25,1,,,SI,,79,97,,10.1080/19761597.2017.1302546,,,,,,,WOS:000404615200006,,,,,J,"Ingold, K",,,,"Ingold, Karin",,,How to create and preserve social capital in climate adaptation policies: A network approach,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"The processes and impacts of climate change require adaptation through what can be described as horizontal and vertical structures of actors' integration. In climate adaptation and natural resource management literature, this structural component is often related to social capital, which is defined in various ways but usually refers to a public good that is built and fostered within a network of social relations. While hypotheses about social capital in networks are well studied in network literature, here, I argue that they should be reflected and tested in the particular context of climate change adaptation policy. I ask: how do communities affected by climate change and the broad range of actors involved in the design of climate adaptation policies build social relationships? And, how do they manage to maintain those relations over time? To answer these questions, climate adaptation policies in six Swiss mountain regions are investigated via social network analysis. Hypotheses about the creation and preservation of weak versus strong ties under the particular setting of Swiss federalism and climate-affected local communities are tested. Results confirm that the creation of weak ties, such as one-way information transfer, can lead to the establishment of mutual collaboration relations over time. Such mutual and reciprocal relations can then more easily be activated by local communities to produce both short-term responses and long-term solutions to climate change impacts.

Intuitively weak ties might be less useful because people communicate less often with them, or more useful because they provide novel information. Granovetter's early work showed that more job-seekers get help via acquaintances than friends (Granovetter, 1973). However, recent work on job-finding (Gee et al., 2017) shows an apparent paradox of weak ties in the United States: most people are helped through one of their numerous weak ties, but a single stronger tie is significantly more valuable at the margin. Although some studies have addressed the importance of weak ties in job finding within specific countries, this is the first paper to use a single dataset and methodology to compare the importance of weak ties across countries. Here, we use de-identified data from almost 17 million social ties in 55 countries to document the widespread existence of this paradox of weak ties across many societies. More people get jobs where their weak ties work. However, this is not because weak ties are more helpful than strong ties - it is because they are more numerous. In every country, the likelihood of going to work where an individual friend works is increasing not decreasing - with tie strength. Yet, there is substantial variation in the added value of a strong tie at the margin across these countries. We show that the level of income inequality in a country is positively correlated with the added value of a strong tie, so that individual strong ties matter more when there is greater income inequality.

Despite this, the role of supply chain actors has been largely overlooked in strategies seeking to encourage the installation of more sustainable domestic heating technologies. With reference to central heating, this paper responds through an ethnographic analysis of how plumbers' merchants and sales representatives can influence the work of heating installers in the United Kingdom. It applies two dimensions of the concept of 'social capital': relational and structural. Relational social capital focuses on the trust, loyalty and reciprocity at play in relations, whilst structural social capital considers how the strength of tie can influence those to whom people turn for advice and support. Together, these ideas demonstrate how relationships amongst these groups can serve to influence product choice and facilitate information exchange. The paper concludes by discussing how these supply chains might be engaged with as a means of encouraging the installation of low carbon domestic technologies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Employing restricted-use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, our empirical results indicate that Blacks have higher PEA-usage rates than Whites, likely caused by their higher unemployment rates. However, Whites in regions with relatively weak professional networks tended to tap into PEAs more than otherwise similar Blacks, reducing the Black-White differential in PEA usage.

They also raise the question about whether current anti-labor-market discrimination policies account for potential job-referral differentials between Black and Whites.

The case of small hydraulic facilities construction,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the roles social networks play in households' contribution to the provision of small hydraulic facilities (SHFs) in rural China. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts a sample-selection ordered probit model (Greene and Hensher, 2010) to estimate the impacts of overall social-network intensity, of the number of strong ties (relatives), and of the number of weak ties (friends), using data on 1,064 representative households collected from three provinces (Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Shandong). Findings - The numbers of strong ties and weak ties both have significant impacts on households' willingness to contribute to SHFs provision, but only the latter has a significant impact on their level of contribution. More specifically, a one standard deviation increase in the number of weak ties (i.e. friends) is associated with a 6.6 percent increase in households' propensity of contributing more than 550 yuan and a 8.2 percent decrease in their propensity of contributing less than 100 yuan. Originality/value - This paper is the first to examine the impacts of social networks on households' contribution to SHFs provision in rural China.

So far, such programmes have yielded mixed success. While partnerships between international, national and local organisations have become the pre-eminent model for RET programmes, we know relatively little about their contribution. This article traces the role of renewable energy partnerships in development cooperation, shifting the analytical emphasis from barriers and drivers to key actors and their relationships. It presents a relational approach for the analysis of development assistance for renewable energy, drawing on theories concerning the role of strong and weak ties in inter-organisational networks. Through an analysis of seven empirical cases from Central America, the article provides insights into how different forms of inter-organisational relationships can facilitate implementation of RET programmes but do not necessarily enhance the capacities of local organisations in a way to support a more sustainable adoption of RETs. On the basis of this analysis, theoretical and policy implications are given concerning the potential of relational approaches for researching technology diffusion processes, and the role of strong and weak ties for the success - or failure - of renewable energy partnerships.

Our empirical study was conducted drawing on the Spanish ceramic tile industrial cluster to test the potential association between social capital and redundancy. Our findings support the idea that structural dispersion mediates the effects of strong ties and the generation of knowledge redundancy.",,,,"Exposito-Langa, Manuel/H-5142-2015; Molina-Morales, F.

Firms can post wage offers in the regular job market, alternatively they can save on advertising costs and rely on word-of-mouth communication. Wages are then negotiated ex-post between the firm and the applicant, so the model can generate wage premiums or penalties depending on the parameter of bargaining power. Moreover, this paper shows that the traditional Hosios (1990) condition continues to hold in an economy with family contacts but it fails to provide efficiency in the economy with weak ties. There are two reasons for the inefficiency. First, workers bargaining over wages do not internalize the positive external effect on their contacts, originating from a higher probability of finding a job. This network externality puts an upward pressure on wages so the market tightness in the referral market is distorted downwards. Second, weak ties do not act in full interest of the unemployed worker so their search intensity is inefficiently low. Finally, this paper shows that a combination of a hiring subsidy and a referral bonus can decentralize the efficient allocation in the economy with weak ties. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Our results indicate that being assigned to the treatment protocol significantly increased the size of social networks, particularly weak ties. Nevertheless, these increases do not translate into improved employment outcomes 18 months following study completion. We do not find any evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity based on the initial size of one's social network; rather those whose strong ties increased at a higher rate during the experiment were significantly less likely to hold a job following the experiment. We find that many of these results also hold at the community level among those who did not directly participate in the intervention.

In the second model, individuals interact with both strong and weak ties and decide how much time they spend with each of them.

Building on Granovetter's idea that weak ties are superior to strong ties for providing support in getting a job, we develop a model in which workers who live far away from jobs choose to have less connections to weak ties. Because of the lack of good public transportation in the US, it is costly (both in terms of time and money) to commute to business centers to meet other types of people who can provide other source of information about jobs. If distant minority workers mainly rely on their strong ties, who are more likely to be unemployed, there is then little chance for them of escaping unemployment. It is therefore the separation in both the social and physical space that prevents ethnic minorities from finding a job. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Due to commercialization, privatization and liberalization, the traditional role of German airport organizations as merely providers of infrastructure gives way to a more market-oriented understanding. Airport service quality and the ability to constantly innovate are important variables that contribute to overall airport attractiveness. Despite that airports are becoming increasingly aware of the need for customer-orientation, the majority of airports still suffer from a lack of genuine customer (passenger) insights. This due to the fact that airlines and tour operators own the passenger relationship and data. The emergence of public social software platforms (SSP), such as the online social network Facebook, is now enabling airport organizations to enter into a dialogue with the passenger and gain a deeper understanding of passenger needs while leveraging social capital. The research paper examines, if airports are able to increase their operational efficiency when entering into a collaborative communication with their customers on SSP. Design/methodology/approach. Based on a social capital / network approach to organizational work, the paper discusses the convergence of social and technological networks and the underlying motives of customers and organizations for joining social software platforms.

As a next step, the theoretical model will be operationalized and empirically tested in 2012 using qualitative and quantitative research. Originality/value. Social capital research as well as the adoption of SSP by organizations is still mainly scoped within organizational boundaries.

In particular, due to cost reasons, they may not be fully informed of their oindirect tieso, that is, of the ties between their partners and other firms. To investigate this issue, the paper uses a survey inquiring about whether firms are aware of the ties that their main direct RD partners may (or may not) have between themselves. Our results show that responding firms are more informed about their partners' other collaboration projects when the partnership is more directly linked to intangible RD capital, when at least one partner is a public research organization or when the partnership is needed to access a new market.

Two dimensions of social capital are investigated-the degree (i.e. size) of individuals' networks of ideation relations, and the structural holes (i.e. gaps between nodes) of those relations. Previous research has presented different and even conflicting empirical results concerning the effect of structural holes on innovation activities, and has not dealt specifically with the ideation phase of the innovation process. By drawing upon an idea database from a Swedish company that has worked systematically with idea management for an extensive period, this study investigates the interrelationship between social capital and ideation. The empirical study reveals that the larger the size of an individual's ego network, the higher is this individual's innovative performance in terms of high-quality ideas, whereas the larger the number of structural holes in an ego network, the lower is the quality of ideas generated by the individual in question. These findings support the conclusion that social capital, in terms of individuals' relationships with fellow employees within firms, has a positive influence on idea-generating behavior. Moreover, the results reveal that the presence of structural holes is negative for ideation performance, thus providing important new input to the recent debate on the interrelationship between structural holes and innovation in general.",,,,,"Bjork, Jennie/0000-0002-9746-4498; /0000-0002-6024-7908",,,,,,,,,,,,1366-2716,1469-8390,,,,,2011,18,6,,,SI,,631,647,,10.1080/13662716.2011.591976,,,,,,,WOS:000299227700006,,,,,J,"van der Leij, M; Goyal, S",,,,"van der Leij, Marco; Goyal, Sanjeev",,,Strong Ties in a Small World,REVIEW OF NETWORK ECONOMICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper examines the celebrated ""strength of weak ties"" theory of Granovetter (1973).

We have adopted a social practice perspective, which we base within an interpretative world view, to better understand how organisational foresight is enacted. This offers a reading of the phenomena, of which the essential contribution is that organisational foresight is more than an organisational property: it is something that reflective people do as they engage with various inputs from the outside and as a result of the continuous interaction between activity systems and their constituting elements. A longitudinal case study illustrates the importance of understanding the construction of collective and individual meaning in working with organisational foresight. The study shows how the inherent rigidity of the existing activity system and the weak ties between these diverse subsets of the organisation may block the interaction between emerging social practices and organisational intentions resulting in ongoing failures of understanding and enactment. A model is developed to include these parameters in an augmented activity systems model. Based on this we have identified the linking of organisational levels as one of the key dimensions to be considered for which the social practice perspective holds significant explanatory strength.

Unlike traditional technical assistance and outreach, knowledge is primarily shared among landowners as opposed to being derived from natural resource professionals. While potentially promising, few studies have investigated these approaches. Through a study of a landowner cooperative in Wisconsin, I report on a finding that considers both the effectiveness of a landowner cooperative in the Upper Midwest (USA) and the social network members rely on in decision-making. The former relies on an importance-performance analysis (IPA) of the services provided by the cooperative and the latter on an egocentric network analysis of members with an emphasis on strong and weak ties. Data were collected via a mail survey to which 146 members (81%) responded. The IPA indicates that the cooperative is providing services with which members are largely satisfied. The network analysis suggests that members, through strong ties, discuss their land with on average three others-primarily natural resource professionals (including cooperative staff), as opposed to other members, neighbors, and kin. However, by virtue of membership, they share weak ties with other members whom they see as trustworthy. The extent to which a network perspective might be applied to similar situations is discussed, as are conceptual implications and future directions. The main conclusion is that the emergence of local landowner associations and peer-to-peer learning requires research methods that better capture the social nature of these new directions.

While aggregate inequality increases in teams that have a diverse set of members, the effect is not reducible to discrimination on the basis of individual status characteristics.

Even if coded knowledge is easier to diffuse, the role of tacit knowledge is often essential for being able to use coded knowledge. Coded knowledge can even be unusable without the augmentation of tacit knowledge. The role of organizational culture is highly relevant for tacit knowledge sharing, which is social activity, face-to-face interaction and therefore can be influenced only through culture. This paper represents a theoretical research about how the types of organizational culture according to the Competitive Values Framework model are supportive for tacit knowledge sharing. The Competing Values Framework consists of four culture types: clan, adhocracy, market and hierarchy. Clan culture is found to support tacit knowledge sharing all, factors described refer to clan culture values and description. Adhocracy culture is the second culture type most supporting tacit knowledge sharing. Market and hierarchy hardly do so, and organizations willing to increase tacit knowledge sharing will have to increase the presence in their culture of clan and adhocracy types.

This trade-off derives from the opposing implications of having redundant (i.e., directly or indirectly linked) contacts. Insofar as egos alters are nonredundant, ego can be expected to become more knowledgeable more quickly. And such nonredundancy can also be the basis for great power as ego monopolizes the flow of resources (including information) between egos alters. However, the very same mechanism that is behind egos power as a provider of resources - i.e., the possession of nonsubstituitable resources on the part of disconnected contacts also implies that that egos alters will themselves be monopolists, thus weakening ego as an acquirer of resources. Furthermore, while the surplus earned from providing resources on monopoly terms is potentially much greater than the surplus earned from acquiring resources on competitive terms, the former strategy carries the risk that socially distant actors will not value one anothers resources. Beyond elucidating the trade-off in the social structural foundation of knowledge and power, our framework also shows how the opposing implications of redundancy are the basis for a broad family of well known trade-offs (cosmopolitanism versus localism; exploration versus exploitation; insider versus stranger; robust versus simple identities) whose relationships with one another and with power and knowledge have not been appreciated. For all such trade-offs, the greater potential returns afforded by nonredundancy are balanced by the surer returns available from redundancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-6491,1464-3650,,,,OCT,2008,17,5,,,,,903,944,,10.1093/icc/dtn036,,,,,,,WOS:000259327600001,,,,,J,"Tassier, T; Menczer, F",,,,"Tassier, Troy; Menczer, Filippo",,,"Social network structure, segregation, and equality in a labor market with referral hiring",JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,,,,,,,,,,"We examine the effects of social network structure on inequality in a model of referral hiring that focuses on groups rather than individuals.

We first develop a model where individuals learn about crime opportunities by interacting with other peers. These interactions can take the form of either strong or weak ties. We find that increasing the percentage of weak ties induces more transitions from non-crime to crime and thus the crime rate in the economy increases. This is because, when the percentage of weak ties is high, delinquents and non-delinquents are in close contact with each other. We then test these predictions using the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (AddHealth), which contains unique detailed informations on friendship relationships among teenagers. The theoretical predictions of our model are confirmed by the empirical analysis since we find that weak ties, as measured by friends of friends, have a positive impact on criminal activities.

Second, it is still unclear what type of networks may exert a positive effect on the different dimensions of development. In particular, the literature has not yet provided a rigorous assessment of the role of strong family ties, that are generally referred to as a form of bonding social capital causing backwardness. This paper investigates the relationship between the three types of social capital so far identified by the literature (i.e. bonding, bridging and linking), and the ""quality"" of economic development, as expressed by human development and an index of social well-being summarizing the state of health of urban ecosystems, public services, gender equality, and labour markets. The empirical analysis is articulated in two stages carried out by means of a multivariate analysis and of a structural equations models analysis. The results suggest that the linking social capital shaped by voluntary organizations has significantly positive effect on human development, but is irrelevant for social well-being. The bonding social capital shaped by strong family ties negatively affects human development, but significantly fosters the quality of life, mainly through a reduction of workers' precariousness. The bridging social capital of weak ties connecting friends and acquaintances follows the pattern of bonding social capital: it is reinforced by strong family ties and has significantly negative effect on human development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0023-5962,,,,,,2008,61,3,,,,,466,499,,10.1111/j.1467-6435.2008.00413.x,,,,,,,WOS:000257757200008,,,,,J,"Morrison, A",,,,"Morrison, Andrea",,,"Gatekeepers of knowledge within industrial districts: Who they are, how they interact",REGIONAL STUDIES,,,,,,,,,,,,"Studies on industrial districts suggest that their innovative performance is strictly linked to their ability to absorb external knowledge.

Our aim in this paper, therefore, is, first, to highlight some of the unresolved issues that surround these concepts, and, second, to explore their usefulness for understanding the evolution of the economic landscape and the process of regional development. We argue that in many important aspects, path dependence and 'lock-in' are place-dependent processes, and as such require geographical explanation. However, the precise meaning of regional 'lock-in', we contend, is unclear, and little is known about why it is that some regional economies become locked into development paths that lose dynamism, whilst other regional economies seem able to avoid this danger and in effect are able to 'reinvent' themselves through successive new paths or phases of development.

We conclude by reexamining the network-resource model that forms the basis for much of the research on the relationship between social networks and job mobility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9246,,,,,APR,2006,65,2,,,,,269,293,,10.1111/j.1536-7150.2006.00451.x,,,,,,,WOS:000237178000003,,,,,B,"Jackson, MO",,"Blundell, R; Newey, WK; Persson, T",,"Jackson, Matthew O.",,,The economics of social networks,"ADVANCES IN ECONOMICS AND ECONOMETRICS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS, NINTH WORLD CONGRESS, VOL I",Econometric Society Monographs,,,,9th World Congress of the Econometric-Society,"AUG 19-24, 2005","Univ Coll London, London, ENGLAND",Econometr Soc,Univ Coll London,,,,,,,"Blundell, Richard W/C-1552-2008","Blundell, Richard W/0000-0003-1588-2299",,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-0-521-69208-3,,,,2006,,41,,,,,1,56,,10.1017/CCOL0521871522.001,,,,,,,WOS:000245433300001,,,,,J,"Tassier, T",,,,"Tassier, T",,,Labor market implications of weak ties,SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although many workers find employment through weak ties, previous studies have shown little empirical support for a connection between weak ties and income.

Moreover, unemployment exhibits duration dependence: the probability of obtaining a job decreases in the length of time that an agent has been unemployed. Finally, we examine inequality between two groups. If staying in the labor market is costly and one group starts with a worse employment status, then that group's drop-out rate will be higher and their employment prospects will be persistently below that of the other group.",,,,"Campos Quispe, Andres/B-4247-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-8282,1944-7981,,,,JUN,2004,94,3,,,,,426,454,,10.1257/0002828041464542,,,,,,,WOS:000222559400003,,,,,J,"Krauth, BV",,,,"Krauth, BV",,,A dynamic model of job networking and social influences on employment,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL,,,,,6th Workshop on Economics with Heterogeneous Interactions Agents (WEHIA),"JUN 07-09, 2001","MAASTRICHT, GERMANY",,,,,"This paper explores an economy in which personal connections facilitate job search. In the model, a firm receives information on the productivity of those job applicants with social ties to its current employees. In addition to providing a theory of networking, the model endogenously generates two classic theories in economic sociology. First, there is a highly non-linear relationship between average human capital in a group of socially connected individuals and the group's employment rate. Small changes in group composition may cause large changes in employment, as suggested in Wilson's 'social isolation' explanation for high unemployment rates among poor African-Americans. The model also supports Granovetter's 'strength of weak ties' hypothesis, which holds that acquaintances are more valuable job contacts than close friends. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

However, the network perspective does not specify the role of networks in the emergence and early growth of a venture. We have distinguished three entrepreneurial processes in new venture development, i.e. discovery of opportunities, securing resources, and obtaining legitimacy, which are of importance for survival and performance. This paper examines how these processes are influenced by strong and/or weak ties and whether the degree of innovation (incremental versus radical) acts as a contingency factor in the way network ties support entrepreneurial processes. In this explorative study three cases on high technology firms in The Netherlands provide empirical material enabling us to develop a number of propositions on the network effect, in particular the mix of strong and weak ties, on the three entrepreneurial processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0921-898X,,,,,DEC,2003,21,4,,,,,409,422,,10.1023/A:1026180418357,,,,,,,WOS:000185859100008,,,,,S,"de Koning, A",,"Katz, JA; Shepherd, DA",,"de Koning, Alice",,,OPPORTUNITY DEVELOPMENT: A SOCIO-COGNITIVE PERSPECTIVE,COGNITIVE APPROACHES TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP RESEARCH,Advances in the Study of Entrepreneurship Innovation and Economic Growth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1048-4736,,978-0-7623-1052-4,,,,2003,6,,,,,,265,314,,10.1016/S1074-7540(03)06009-4,,,,,,,WOS:000270932400009,,,,,J,"Ruef, M",,,,"Ruef, M",,,"Strong ties, weak ties and islands: structural and cultural predictors of organizational innovation",INDUSTRIAL AND CORPORATE CHANGE,,,,,,,,,,,,"How does the tendency of entrepreneurs to engage in innovation relate to their structural and cultural embeddedness?

These hypotheses are evaluated using theoretically derived indicators and ordinary least squares regression. Most of the hypotheses considered in this paper do not receive support, and the one hypothesis that does lacks a consistent theoretical explanation. From this analysis, I draw two important conclusions: First, the relationship between the prestige of a social network contact and prestige attainment may be empirically strong, bur the theoretical explanation linking them lacks consistency. Secondly, empirical work performed to test social network theories should no longer focus on dyadic data alone.

It is mainly based on in-depth interviews in 155 SMEs of the mechanical engineering industry and with regional innovation consultants. Empirical results suggest that regional networks are hardly dominant features of the surveyed areas. Weak ties and innovation-oriented relationships are far less spatially restricted than generally assumed. In many cases, the access to interregional contact networks is much more important, especially for technology-intensive firms. Generally, technological change and competitiveness are pursued more through individual product-oriented firm strategies than through intensified regional networking.

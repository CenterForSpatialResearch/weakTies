Drawing on the social network theory (SNT), this study attempts to investigate the effect of social network ties on perceived employability (PEM) and job insecurity (JIS) and how PEM mediates the association between social ties and job insecurity. Moreover, the current study pursues to assess the moderation effect of information sharing in the association between social network ties and PEM. Using the survey approach, we recruited teachers from government schools. The proposed model and relationships were validated through structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear regression. The findings revealed that strong tie is significantly related to PEM and JIS. Similarly, the weak tie is significantly related to PEM except for JIS. This study extends SNT by empirically establishing the influence of network characteristics (strong and weak ties) on PEM and JIS. This study helps school management and government policymakers to enhance teacher's PEM and job security through networking and training opportunities. This research moreover guides government policymakers to formulate realistic education policies with the consensuses of school management. This practice will enhance teachers' trust toward acceptance and implementation of educational policies.

Moreover, the knowledge based view (KBV) has long suggested that due to stronger cognitive links within firms, internal compared to external service provision creates better conditions for knowledge sharing. Empirical evidence for this claim is however scarce, and the KBV does not explain the mechanisms for more knowledge sharing in internal sourcing in detail. Moreover, there is now some evidence to suggest that firms' relationships with external sourcing partners are becoming more similar to those with captive centres, which represent a less traditional form of insourcing setting. To scrutinize the possible knowledge sharing advantages of internal sourcing in more depth, we turn to social capital (SC) research. There are some theoretical claims that SC and knowledge sharing are stronger within than between firms, and there is ample evidence that SC facilitates knowledge sharing. Our survey results suggest that the extent of knowledge sharing and SC are indeed stronger in a captive than in an external sourcing mode, and that structural (tie strength), cognitive (shared understanding), and relational (trust) aspects of SC mediate the effect of sourcing mode on the extent of knowledge sharing. By contrast, network stability (a structural aspect) mediated knowledge sharing only indirectly, by reinforcing the other SC aspects.

According to Dunbar's hypothesis, this phenomenon is due to a limited human cognitive capacity to handle too many social relationships, together with a few time for socializing. These constraints result in an organization of people's ego-network into four or five groups depending on the strength of the interactions, the so called Dunbar's circles. The verification of the Dunbar's hypothesis, the identification of social circles and their characterization are still open questions, although researchers have found evidence of its validity on different social networks, from small offline networks to online social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook. In addition, little is known about the semantic aspects of the circles, i.e. who are the members of each circle. In this paper, we cope with these issues by analyzing a mobile phone graph where people's interactions are expressed by both voice calls and text messages. We firstly compare two methods for the identification of the circles, which rely on the different definitions of strength proposed in literature. Both methods confirm the subdivision of ego-networks into four or five circles, each characterized by a specific interaction strength. Then, we validate the Dunbar's hypothesis and, by leveraging some powerful features of the mobile phone dataset in use, we provide a first semantic characterization of social circles. We show, for instance, that people maintain relationships with the members of the closest circles by combining calls and texts. In addition, by detecting home and work locations of each individual, we highlight that a semantic aspect, such as the role of the alters, impacts on the ego-network circles.

In contrast, for users that are more selective and have fewer Facebook friends, all three aforementioned tie strength measures correlate with trust. Our findings are preliminary evidence that traditional measures of dyadic trust like embeddedness which are used widely in physical-world social networks may not always be effective predictors of digital trust, because not all online social ties are created equal.

The traditional definitions of strong ties (with two endpoints in the same community) and weak ties (with two endpoints in different communities) are being challenged by overlapping community structures. Because of their unique nature, the relationships between overlapping nodes and non-overlapping nodes are difficult to classify as strong or weak. In view of this, it is here proposed that the coefficient indicator for overlapping communities was used to redefine node relationships and enable the quantification of strong and weak ties. Next, changes in the quantities of strong and weak ties were analyzed by varying the threshold values of the overlap coefficient. Finally, the effect of weak ties in information dissemination was assessed in overlapping and non-overlapping situations, respectively. Results demonstrated that the overlap coefficient proposed in this paper could better characterize the strong and weak attributes of edges under overlapping community structures.",,,,"Yuan, Peiyan/M-6040-2015","Yuan, Peiyan/0000-0003-0023-1194",,,,,,,,,,,,2169-3536,,,,,,2017,5,,,,,,10012,10016,,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2710360,,,,,,,WOS:000404270600116,,,,,B,"Zhang, Z; Xu, M",,,IEEE,"Zhang, Zhuo; Xu, Min",,,Collaborative Development of Complex Equipment: A Network Perspective,PROCEEDINGS OF 2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GREY SYSTEMS AND INTELLIGENT SERVICES (GSIS),,,,,IEEE International Conference on Grey Systems and Intelligent Services (GSIS),"AUG 08-11, 2017","Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, SWEDEN","IEEE, IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc, Inst Operat Res & Management Sci, Int Assoc Grey Syst & Uncertainty Anal, Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Business Sch, Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Inst Grey Syst Studies, Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management",Stockholm Univ,,,"In an open innovation environment, complex equipment is always developed within a collaborative development network.

The process of dyadic friendship formation depends on the agent's (participant's) spatial configuration, attributes affecting friendship, and interaction with other agents. To model these interactions, we use fuzzy iterated prisoner's dilemma (Fuzzy-IPD) utilizing the decision factors contributing to similar social processes. These strategies have been independently discussed in previously published studies. We, however, use them in combination to design a descriptive model with different experimental settings in an ad-hoc simulation framework. Using an integrationist approach, we blend multiple individual components of friendship formation to construct a comprehensive model.

Design/methodology/approach - A 2 x 2 x 2 mixed design is used. Temporal distance (near vs distant) and message concreteness (text vs picture) are between-subjects factors; sharing intentions (close friends vs general public) is a within-subjects factor. Findings - Findings indicate that consumers are more likely to share promotional messages with their strong rather than weak ties. If they perceive that purchases will occur soon, concrete promotional messages will more strongly motivate them to share the message with their friends. However, if they perceive that purchases will occur in the distant future, abstract messages are more motivating. The difference occurs because construal-level theory is more effective among strong E-WOM ties. Originality/value - By studying senders' perspectives, the authors make a new theoretical and practical contribution to the emerging literature on E-WOM communication. Specifically, the authors show how senders are persuaded to share information with their strong- or weak-tie audiences according to the concreteness of a message and temporal distance.

In this paper, we first highlight the importance of different types of ties in social relations originated from social sciences, and then propose a novel social recommendation method based on a new Probabilistic Matrix Factorization model that incorporates the distinction of strong and weak ties for improving recommendation performance.

These efforts have successfully demonstrated prediction of various attributes based on social connectivity, mobility, dynamic checkin information, etc., including prediction of user location as well as future checkin locations. In this paper, we study the relationship between shared checkin locations and the structure and nature of social ties. We argue that typical LSBNs are in fact composed of layers of networks of varying structure and function and that it is possible to deconcolve these networks through effective statistical analysis of shared checkins. In this context, we pose and validate the following hypotheses: (1) A large number of shared checkins imply social connectivity; however, social connectivity does not imply statistically large number of shared checkins; (2) entities in social ties that share a large number of checkins tend to be strongly clustered. We hypothesize that such strong ties (e.g., family ties and friendships) carry higher influence compared to weaker ties (mere acquaintances) in the social network; (3) social ties that have statistically fewer shared checkins (weak ties) tend to be less clustered than the underlying (baseline) network. We hypothesize that such ties (e.g., professional ties, friends of friends, and acquaintances) carry less influence; and (4) social ties that have statistically large number of shared checkins (strong ties) tend to be relatively more dynamic when compared to weak ties over a period of time.

We consider whether the deduced relationships between members of the community of educators constitute weak ties. A deduced relationship exists when two educators access the same resource. If these deduced relationships do constitute weak ties, then other theorized network properties should also be manifest, namely homophily and triadic closures. Our findings support these theoretical conjectures. Firstly, results indicate that the strength of a tie is directly proportional to the level of similarity between users in the network in terms of their propensity to use and share resources and their level of comfort with and use of technology (homophily property). Secondly, we found strong support for the triadic closure property (formation of a weak tie between unconnected nodes that share a common neighbor).

Our idea to address this problem is to investigate the distributions of per-node weight rather than all weights in the mobile phone network. Using CDRs data of 32,000 active mobile phone users, the empirical finding shows that the distributions of the logarithmic weights follow the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The shape parameter of the GEV distribution reveals the existence of a typical strategy. The typical strategy could be regarded as an ""intrinsic strategy"" which indicates that the majority of people have strategies similar to the typical one, while the rest deviate far from it.

Given the powerful information dissemination capabilities, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been suggested as interventions to build infant care awareness and to modify healthcare behaviors. We examine how the use of one ICT intervention-specifically, eHealth kiosks disseminating authenticated and accessible medical information-can alleviate the problem of high infant mortality in rural India. We investigate how mothers' social networks affect their use of eHealth kiosks, seeking professional medical care for their infants and, ultimately, infant mortality. Drawing on the social epidemiology and social networks literatures, we focus on advice and hindrance from both strong and weak ties as the conduit of social influence on mothers' health-related behaviors for the care of their infants. Over a period of 7 years, we studied 4,620 infants across 10 villages where the eHealth kiosks were implemented along with support resources for proxy use. The results revealed that (1) eHealth kiosk use promotes seeking professional medical care and reduces infant mortality, (2) mothers are especially vulnerable to hindrance from both strong and weak ties as they choose to maintain the status quo of traditional infant healthcare practices (e.g., reliance on untrained personnel, superstitions, fatalism) in villages, and (3) advice from both strong and weak ties offers the potential to break down misplaced beliefs about infant healthcare practices and to develop literacy on seeking professional medical care. In contrast, in a comparative group of 10 neighboring villages, the reduction in infant mortality was not as pronounced and the effect of professional medical care in reducing infant mortality was lower. Our findings suggest that an ICT intervention can effectively address one of society's most important problems (i.e., infant mortality) even in parts of the world with limited resources and deep suspicion of technology and change.

The first, a survey study (n = 117) explored the concept of contextual rarity of shared user attributes as a measure to improve desirability in mobile social matches. The second, an interview study (n = 58) explored people's motivations to meet others in various contexts. From these studies we derived a set of novel context-aware social matching concepts, including contextual sociability and familiarity as an indicator of opportune social context; contextual engagement as an indicator of opportune personal context; and contextual rarity, oddity, and activity partnering as an indicator of opportune relational context. The findings of these studies establish the importance of different contextual factors and frame the design space of context-aware social matching systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1046-8188,1558-2868,,,,OCT,2015,34,1,,,,,,,1,10.1145/2751557,,,,,,,WOS:000363585900001,,,,,J,"Ahn, H; Park, JH",,,,"Ahn, Hyerim; Park, Ji-Hong",,,The structural effects of sharing function on Twitter networks: Focusing on the retweet function,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Social network services (SNSs) provide the functions for both the management of social networks and information diffusion.

Knowledge regarding the impact of such diverse technologies on job performance, however, is currently limited. This study adopts a technology use lens to study the effect of three categories of social media use social, hedonic, and cognitive on job performance, as mediated by three dimensions of social capital. The research was conducted via a large-scale survey within a multinational Information Technology company. Social and cognitive uses of technology were empirically shown to have a positive, albeit indirect, effect on employees' routine and innovative job performance. Hedonic use of the technology, while having a direct negative impact on routine performance was shown to positively contribute to the development of social ties, leading to a mitigating positive influence on innovative performance. This interesting positive side of hedonic use, along with all findings from our study, are discussed and used to offer insights to future research and practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This relationship enables us to examine a context in which members share a common goal of resolving programming problems through knowledge sharing in contrast with other community settings where only general topics are discussed (e.g., societal and emotional issues). Data were collected through a survey of a virtual community for website programming composed of 69 members. Affirming conventional perception, results of the study indicate that weak ties affect the level of generalized trust and facilitate group identification. Remarkably, the number of members' strong ties is not significantly related to the degree of their perceived norms regarding generalized reciprocity Reciprocity refers to a mutual expectation that a benefit granted at present should be repaid in the future. The results suggest two key points. First, even for a virtual community of interest, weak ties overshadow strong ties in explaining the outcome variables. Second, reciprocity is not guaranteed even in a focused form of discussion with a non-social topic that involves specialized knowledge. Therefore, virtual community members should be cautious even if ties are strong. Overall, results imply that virtual community administrators, particularly those who manage specialized communities, should be attentive to the strong and weak ties that exist among the community members.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0095-0033,,,,,MAY,2015,46,2,,,,,43,60,,,,,,,,,WOS:000356982700004,,,,,J,"Teng, CI",,,,"Teng, Ching-I",,,Drivers of interdependence and network convergence in social networks in virtual communities,ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Social networks proliferate in virtual communities, where interdependence and network convergence among users are key to their development.

In this framework, emerging needs, such as content dissemination, social discovery and question and answering, advocate the raising of novel communication paradigms where the binding content-recipients is not provided by the sender (in the classical IP addressing style), but directly executed by specific recipients with interest in it. This paper proposes a novel communication protocol, named InterestCast, or ICast, solving the problem for a wide range of social scenarios and applying to an opportunistic network whose nodes are the personal devices of moving individuals, possibly interacting with fixed road-side devices. The protocol is able to chase users' interests decoupling content tags from locations and social communities. In order to cross community boundaries and reach farthest destinations, ICast adopts mechanisms that properly extract weak ties, i.e. encounters between nodes that rarely interact, but that connect different communities.

In this paper, we study the relationship between shared checkin locations and the structure and nature of social ties. We argue that typical LSBNs are in fact composed of layers of networks of varying structure and function, and that it is possible to deconcolve these networks through effective statistical analysis of shared checkins. In this context, we pose and validate the following hypotheses: (i) a large number of shared checkins imply social connectivity; however, social connectivity does not imply statistically large number of shared checkins; (ii) entities in social ties that share a large number of checkins tend to be strongly clustered. We hypothesize that such strong ties (for example, family ties, friendships etc.) carry higher influence compared to weaker ties (mere acquaintances) in the social network; and (iii) social ties that have statistically fewer shared checkins (weak ties) tend to be less clustered than the underlying (baseline) network. We hypothesize that such ties (for example professional ties, friends of friends, acquaintances etc.,) carry less influence.

ESM improves interaction transparency and can be regarded as a sociotechnical system that provides a language for communication and symbolic action as well as a better sense of others' social identity. Accordingly, the individual characteristics of knowledge seekers and contributors determine why and how interactions occur.

With stress on the communication and socialization aspects of online gaming, we need different perspectives from those of the past to investigate online gaming and draw on social capital theory. By socially interacting with other gamers, the online gamer not only builds new relationships (bridging social capital), but he/she also strengthens existing relationships (bonding social capital).

This article outlines several key differences between traditional offline social networks and online social media networks by juxtaposing an established typology of social network research with a well-regarded definition of social media platforms that articulates four key features. The results show that at four major points of intersection, social media has considerable theoretical implications for SNA.

First, it is the adoption of the information pushing mechanism that greatly facilitates the information propagation in OSNs. Second, some global but cost-intensive strategies, such as selecting the ties of higher betweenness centralities for information propagation, no longer have significant advantages. Third, the random selection strategy is more efficient than selecting the strong ties for information propagation in OSNs. Along this line, we provide further explanations by categorizing weak ties into positive and negative ones and reveal the special bridge effect of positive weak ties.

Hence, knowledge management (KM) has been extensively researched. Prior knowledge management research has recognized the importance of making individual knowledge available throughout the organization. Most KM research, however, has thus far focused on a technology-based KM strategy with relatively little discussion on how knowledge can be effectively shared using organizational social relationships. This paper focuses on how knowledge-intensive organizations can design and use ""knowledge flow networks (KFNs)"" in order to facilitate knowledge sharing. Designing and using KFNs to maximize knowledge sharing is a complex problem. We formulate a mixed integer programming model (MIP), and present a heuristic in order to facilitate systematic analysis and understanding of effective KFNs. We consider organizations that support multiple skills and have workers with varying levels of competence who are connected through IT-facilitated organizational social relationships. Our results, based on computational experiments, provide several interesting insights and intelligence into the design of an effective KFN. First, our results highlight that average workers play a vital bridging role in knowledge sharing. Second, social networking concepts of ties and cohesiveness are used to better understand the dynamics of knowledge sharing. The importance of indirect relationships between expert workers and the network effects due to indirect relationships are illustrated. For effective KM, we also illustrate how organizations can reduce the total number of ties required in a multi-skill environment. In our model extensions, we study the impact of worker turnover and knowledge depreciation on the design and use of effective KFNs. Managerial implications of these results are discussed. The model and solution procedure proposed in this paper can serve as a managerial benchmarking framework for effective management of KFNs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Tie strength describes the strength of a social relationship. In the past, SNA literature with a knowledge management context has often emphasized the importance of strong and/or weak ties rather than of intermediate (medium strong) ties in a social network. Nevertheless, in this study, intermediate ties are identified as the dominant links among key groups of organisation in a social network. Intermediate ties also help connect otherwise weakly linked organisations. Moreover, a definition of intermediate ties in the context of knowledge management is introduced. With the help of cluster analysis and an investigation into the levels of reciprocity, intermediate ties can be clearly defined in a social network.

Moreover, we find that the relations between the likelihood of searching for information via personal sources and work outcomes, such as productivity and job satisfaction, are moderated by positive affect. Specifically, we find that positive affect negatively moderates the relations between personal information search and productivity, but positively moderates the relations between personal information search and job satisfaction.

CKSs allow various relationships between askers and answerers as well as among answerers. This study classifies social ties in CKSs into three kinds of ties: answering ties, co-answering ties, and getting answers ties. This study examines the influence of the structural and relational attributes of social networks on the quality of answers at CKSs for answering ties, co-answering ties, and getting answers ties. Data collected from the top-100 heavy users of Yahoo! Answers and of Naver Knowledge In are used to test the research model. The analysis results show that the centrality of the answering ties significantly influences the quality of answers while the average strength of the answering ties has an insignificant effect on the quality of answers.

Some SNS are based on six degreess of separation (6SNS), and these have emerged as the most frequently visited WWW sites. Design/methodology/approach - Using a randomized control group pre-test-post-test experimental design, responses to a questionaire to test the differences among 6SNS users and non-users on 12 issues of benefit were analyzed. Findings - The tests show, first, that, compared with traditional virtual communities, SNS evoke higher ratings for ""trust in website,"" ""trust in other members,"" and ""quality of friends."" Second, SNS can provide users with entertainment and greater social involvement. People who use these sites express postive attitudes about them. Third, no significant differences were found between SNS and traditional internet media on ""meeting new friends,"" ""maintaining relationships,"" ""searching for friends,"" ""searching for information,"" and ""understanding and learning."" These results can be attributed to language differences. Originality/value - The value of 6SNS is recognized by the business world. In October 2007, Microsoft invested $240 million to buy 1.6 percent shares of Facebook. Today Facebook alone has more than 300 million users.

Through a survey of employee dyads, our findings indicate that perceived information relevance is a significant antecedent of source preference for both task and social information seeking, whereas perceived relational benefit is significant in the context of task information. The results also show that perceived relational benefit has a stronger effect on source preference in task information seeking than in social information seeking. Furthermore, preference for a source is a significant antecedent of the frequency of sourcing in both contexts.

Several competing models are developed and compared using Bayesian structural equation models of dyadic data.

In our approach, theories developed in sociology, political science and information science are used to design a model for evaluating the credibility of messages that is user-specific and that is sensitive to the social network in which the user resides. To recommend new messages to users, we employ Bayesian learning, built on past user behaviour, integrating new concepts of context and completeness of messages inspired from the strength of weak ties hypothesis, from social network theory.

To investigate how PHAs and their friends/family members acquire and share network-mediated HIV/AIDS information, semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted in three rural regions of Canada. Interviews were carried outwith 114 PHAs, their friends/family members, and health care and service providers.

Interview data were analyzed qualitatively and compared to Haythornthwaite's (1996) concepts of network-mediated information processes and Talja and Hansen's (2006) collaborative information behavior framework. Findings revealed that participants obtained HIV/AIDS information from their networks through five interactive processes: joint seeking, tag-team seeking, exposure, opportunity, and legitimation.

These interactions occur through message postings to produce an on-line public good of knowledge, where all participants in the network can then access this knowledge. regardless of their active participation in the network. Using theories and concepts of collective action and public goods, five hypotheses are developed regarding the structural and social characteristics that support the online provision and maintenance of knowledge in an electronic network of practice. Using social network analysis, we examine the structure of message contributions that produce and sustain the public good. We then combine the results from network analysis with survey results to examine the underlying pattern of exchange, the role of the critical mass, the quality of the ties sustaining participation. the heterogeneity of resources and interests of participants, and changes in membership that impact the structural characteristics of the network. Our results suggest that the electronic network of practice chosen for this study is Sustained through generalized exchange, is supported by a critical mass of active members, and that members develop strong ties with the community as a whole rather than develop interpersonal relationships. Knowledge contribution is significantly related to an individual's tenure in the occupation, expertise, availability of local resources and a desire to enhance one's reputation. and those in the critical mass are primarily responsible for creating and Sustaining the public good of knowledge.

Trust has been widely recognized in many studies as an important enabling factor for seeking knowledge; however, the role of trust in promoting knowledge-seeking behavior using KMS has not been adequately addressed. Drawing upon the extant literature on trust and information technology adoption, this article examines the relationships between the knowledge seekers' trust in the community of KMS users, their perceptions toward the system (perceived usefulness and perceived seeking efforts), and the intention to continually use the KMS. The results reveal that trust in the community of KMS users does not directly affect the employees' knowledge-seeking continuance intention; rather, it happens indirectly through a mediated effect of perceived usefulness of the KMS. Furthermore, we find that trust seems to be a stronger determinant of perceived usefulness than of perceived seeking efforts.

Ubiquitous proximity e-service highlights the collective effort focused on collecting the user group's power as the reference for ubiquitous trust decisions. Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides some theoretical utility support for ubiquitous proximity e-service. The ""homophily"" describes the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others. By highlighting the ""homophily"" of e-service participants, these isolated individuals can be treated as a group with proximity. The main value of ubiquitous proximity e-service utilizes the network effect from the collective effort of interpersonal social network. Findings - In order to leap the trust barrier for users to embrace these ubiquitous e-services, ubiquitous proximity e-service makes it possible for users to collaborate with their nearby user groups to establish a reliable and trustworthy interaction environment. The simulation outcomes for trust decision quality enhancement show a significant improvement in a variety of environment settings. Practical implications - A significant value of ubiquitous proximity e-service lies in the increased possibility of establishing innovative social network relationships. From the interpersonal perspective, unfamiliar strangers can make connections with individuals who are proximal and homoplastic to them. The strength of proximity gives people better chances to make interpersonal connections, including both weak ties and strong ties.

One of the most important implications of these changes is the expansion of resources and products that are globally tradable, highlighting the importance of knowledge as the key economic resource of lasting competitive advantage. As a consequence of this shift in the economy, an increasing number of industries are moving from the closed innovation model to the open innovation model that created porous boundaries between the innovative company and its surrounding environment, changing the inter- and intra-organizational modes of coordination. In an environment where knowledge is the key economic resource and the open innovation model is applied in more and more industries, we are experiencing the increasing importance of the New Technology-Based Firm (NTBF). NTBFs face a number of difficulties mainly associated with a lack of resources and entrepreneurial skills and in order overcome the difficulties NTBFs strive towards flexibility while accelerating the development and commercialization processes by creating and/or entering business networks. By adopting a knowledge-based view for NTBFs and consequently placing knowledge in the centre of a systemic innovation model, knowledge networks constitute an asset for NTBFs. As this new form of cooperation takes multiple and often unpredictable forms it is thus essential to develop strategy formulation tools and processes that can help NTBFs to face their challenges. Until now little attention has been given to the development of strategy tools and processes tailored for the requirements of NTBFs. The present paper presents a concept to cope with NTBFs' by developing a generic process for strategy formulation. In this respect, an action research project was initiated. The proposed concept was initially designed, although not exclusively, for a Greek NTBF, Astrofos Ltd. The author, who is coordinator of the incubator where Astrofos is sited, is acting as-a strategy consultant for the firm and has taken part in all its major decisions since summer 2007. In order to build the strategy formulation process, this paper proposes a mapping technique that attempts to depict a NTBF's tangible and intangible transactions as well as the strength of ties between the focal NTBF and its partners and the complexity of the knowledge. In developing the mapping technique, we have used a combination of the concept of weak ties, derived from social network analysis, with the notion of complex knowledge, as this combination was initially proposed by Hansen (1999). Additionally, a set of questions is proposed that have to be answered in order to pass from knowledge identification to knowledge transfer, from a strategic point of view. In this regard, the presented methodology constitutes an effort, on the one hand, to study the emergent patterns in what is considered to be a chaotic or disordered system and, on the other, to stimulate the creation of new patterns in the system that would be consistent with the NTBF's strategy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-906638-16-0,,,,2008,,,,,,,279,287,,,,,,,,,WOS:000260973300032,,,,,B,"Bettoni, M; Schiller, G; Bernhard, W",,"Harorimana, D; Watkins, D",,"Bettoni, Marco; Schiller, Gabriele; Bernhard, Willi",,,Weak ties cooperation in the CoRe knowledge network,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,,,,,9th European Conference on Knowledge Management,"SEP 04-05, 2008","Southampton Sloent Univ, Southampton, ENGLAND",,Southampton Sloent Univ,,,"How to implement a collaborative knowledge strategy under conditions of weak ties? This paper will first explain how came that we faced this question in the research department of our university, then tell the story of how we are answering it by means of a new kind of knowledge network called ""CoRe"" and finally reflect on lessons we are learning about weak ties cooperation. The Swiss Distance University of Applied Sciences is organized in a radically decentralized way combined with traditional hierarchical structures and functional divisions. This has led to an insufficient level of interactions between geographically distributed university members (academic staff, students) so that weak ties have become the norm. In research one major consequence was that research activities were too much isolated in the departments, human resources were dispersed and research knowledge did not flow enough. Projects were small and less recognised, know how got easily lost and research tools' development was too slow. How to meet the challenge of improving research performances under conditions of weak ties like these? Our approach consisted in a collaborative knowledge strategy: to create and cultivate CoRe, an intra-organizational knowledge network of researchers (academic staff, students) organized as a community of practice connecting its members around the common task of stewarding research knowledge. This paper provides first an overview of how we are designing, implementing and cultivating the CoRe knowledge network and then reflections on the new subject of weak ties cooperation as realized in CoRe. In the first part, after introducing the background of the CoRe project as well as our approach to knowledge cooperation we will present the development process and focus on the evolution of the network requirements by comparing the initial and a revised version. In both cases these requirements were collaboratively developed by the network members in two large events: a) the network launch, a future search event (June 2006) and b) the 1(st) Annual CoRe Conference (June 2007). Based on an analysis of the evolution between these two versions, in the second part our paper will provide reflections and key lessons learned about how to design and implement a collaborative knowledge strategy which is able to foster knowledge cooperation under conditions of weak ties.

This paper finds that how matters become subjects of decision-making is at least as important part of municipal decision-making as how they are formally decided on. Both the progression of the process and the actual content of the decisions are largely resolved in preparation. The complex and rapidly changing operational environment is imposing special requirements, which are driving the municipal sector implementing new kinds of patterns. The paper deems it important that, alongside effective issues, municipal administration also strives to transcend conventional truths, search for new ideas from various non-interrelated sources, and create new possibilities from them. The paper engages with the knowledge management research tradition because the success of municipality is considered to be dependent on how efficiently the municipality can balance knowledge exploitation with knowledge exploration. Rather than focusing on administrative structures, the paper concentrates on the official and unofficial interaction processes within the preparation system, and between the preparation system and its environment, The paper finds that the interaction processes have hidden potential, which can be translated into a resource for balancing effectiveness and innovativeness. The resulting complexity-based framework, which can be seen as the main contribution of this paper, shows that paying attention to the interrelationships between the various actors and invisible dynamics of the preparation system provides a new perspective on the challenges facing municipal preparatory work. The complexity-based framework can be seen as an 'enabling structure' that facilitates the running of the preparation system and simultaneously ensures the co-evolution between the preparation system and the surrounding environment. This framework consists of five dimensions, which are: (i) interaction and feedback, (ii) trust, (iii) internal mechanisms, (iv) diversity, and (v) sense of timing and coevolution. The complexity-based framework helps to understand how municipal communities can benefit from their internal and external knowledge reserves and adapt to changes in the operating environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-906638-10-8,,,,2008,,,,,,,333,340,,,,,,,,,WOS:000259556500038,,,,,B,"Miyamoto, T; Hattori, Y; Yatera, A",,"Harorimana, D; Watkins, D",,"Miyamoto, Takuya; Hattori, Yasuhiro; Yatera, Akiyuki",,,The relation of rotation and knowledge transfer: A study of the R&D activities of a Japanese manufacturer,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,,,,,9th European Conference on Knowledge Management,"SEP 04-05, 2008","Southampton Sloent Univ, Southampton, ENGLAND",,Southampton Sloent Univ,,,"Japanese manufacturers have competitive strength particularly in the electronics and automobile industries. Moreover, Japanese manufacturers have efficient knowledge sharing practices. Therefore, we can state that Japanese manufacturers possess competitive strength from a knowledge-based view (KBM). In order to investigate the origin of this competitive strength pertaining to knowledge, which is evident in Japanese manufacturers, this paper sheds light on the rotation of personnel with regard to the research and development of forefront technology. We procured the rotation data of all the engineers (N = 1350) assigned to the central research institutes of a Japanese manufacturer. The central research institutes consisted of the material, mechatronics, e-component, and multimedia research institutes. In addition to utilizing this quantitative data, we interviewed the R&D director of the company who was familiar with all of its R&D activities. First, we analysed each research institute in 1998 based on the following criteria, and subsequently analysed each engineer's rotation term: (1) the number of engineers who had worked in the planning departments, (2) the number of engineers who had worked in the basic research institute, and (3) the number of engineers who had worked in the product development departments. Furthermore, based on the data obtained from the interviews, we were able to infer as follows. First, engineers from the planning departments play an important role in accessing the expertise of other organizations. Second, engineers from the basic research institute play a significant role in evaluating external expertise by utilizing the professional networks to which they belonged in the basic research institute. Finally, engineers from the product development departments play a crucial role in adapting the research in forefront technology to the market needs. The rotation of personnel facilitates knowledge transfer. This is because the rotated personnel bring with them new values, ideas, knowledge, and networks. In this paper, we discuss an adequate rotation policy by analysing two successful and unsuccessful research institutes. Our research subject was a large Japanese manufacturer. We revealed that the successful research institutes conducted adequate knowledge transfer through adequate rotation. Japanese manufacturers are well known as high-performance knowledge-sharing companies with strong networks.

In the market, users can access a repository of knowledge for a single price (repository pricing) or knowledge items in the repository can be sold individually (knowledge pricing). However, users have been found to prefer repository pricing but not the knowledge in the repository. This irrationality can cause market failure because users derive a suboptimal level of utility from the knowledge repository, and vendors have contradictory pricing and knowledge strategies. We empirically examine a joint explanation from two competing theoretical perspectives that accounts for this inconsistency nicely: The mental accounting perspective endorses repository pricing because it entices users with the benefits of the whole repository, whereas the transaction decoupling perspective finds expression in individually priced knowledge because it prevents the discrete benefit of knowledge from becoming obscure. By integrating the two theoretical perspectives and considering price, knowledge, and user characteristics simultaneously, the results offer important implications for the market transfer of knowledge. Repository pricing attracts users and is essential to initiate the transfer process, whereas knowledge pricing generates knowledge preference and is thus an effective approach for learning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0742-1222,,,,,WIN,2007,24,3,,,,,79,108,,10.2753/MIS0742-1222240303,,,,,,,WOS:000252906300004,,,,,J,"Morris, SA; Goldstein, ML",,,,"Morris, Steven A.; Goldstein, Michel L.",,,"Manifestation of research teams in journal literature: A growth model of papers, coauthorship, weak ties, authors, collaboration, and Lotka's law",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"This article introduces a team-based model of researchers in a specialty and investigates the manifestation of such teams in a specialty's literature.

Based on perspectives of brand community and WOM behavior, this paper contributes to virtual community and marketing research by clarifying the effects of consumers' lurking and posting behaviors in a consumer community on brand loyalty.",,,,,"Shang, Rong-An/0000-0003-2268-3853",,,,,,,,,,,,1066-2243,,,,,,2006,16,4,,,,,398,418,,10.1108/10662240610690025,,,,,,,WOS:000240930800003,,,,,J,"Kwan, MM; Cheung, PK",,,,"Kwan, MM; Cheung, PK",,,The knowledge transfer process: From field studies to technology development,JOURNAL OF DATABASE MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"Knowledge transfer in an organization is the process through which one unit (e.g., group, department, or division) is affected by the experience of another. Yet, experience has shown that transferring knowledge, whether at the individual, group, product line, department, or division level is usually a laborious, time-consuming, and difficult task. In this article, we review 20 recent empirical studies on knowledge transfer and suggest a four-stage process model to summarize and organize their findings. The resulted in a framework where determinants for success at each stage of the knowledge transfer process are defined. Based on this knowledge transfer framework, we propose a knowledge transfer management system that integrates current knowledge management tools and technologies to support the needs at different stages of the knowledge transfer process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1063-8016,,,,,JAN-MAR,2006,17,1,,,,,16,32,,10.4018/jdm.2006010102,,,,,,,WOS:000233094500003,,,,,B,"Sun, HP; Liu, XY",,"Lan, H",,Sun Hong-ping; Liu Xiang-yang,,,Determinants of expatriate knowledge transfer performance: A social capital perspective,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2006 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANAGEMENT SCIENCE & ENGINEERING (13TH), VOLS 1-3",,,,,13th International Conference on Management Science and Engineering,"OCT 05-07, 2006","Lille, FRANCE","Univ Sci & Tecnol Lille, Harbin Inst Technol, State Univ Management, IEEE Engn Management Soc, Natl Nat Sci Fdn",,,,"Although expatriation is increasingly regarded as a vital means for enhancing knowledge diffusion within multinational companies, it has also precluded an in-depth examination of particular inputs to individual performance in knowledge transferring. Drawing upon social capital theory, a model of expatriate knowledge transfer effectiveness in term of knowledge transfer, relational development and task performance, was developed and tested using a sample of 147 expatriate managers working in Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai. This model predicts that depth of relationship with host country nationals (HCNs) and access to information and resources (network configuration), trust and instrumental support received (social norm), and HCN's cultural empathy (ability) have direct effects on expatriate knowledge transfer effectiveness. Given the exploratory nature of this research, we hypothesize that all forms of social capital will influence expatriate performance. Results showed the social capital variables were strong predictors of expatriate knowledge transfer performance. Depth of relation, access to information and resources, HCN's cultural empathy had significant direct effects on various dimensions of performance (i.e., knowledge transfer, relational development and knowledge transfer), but the social norm constructs (i.e., trust and instrumental support received) were not found the supports as expected.

We develop five research questions based on network models and the existing literature. We then investigate these research questions using a case study of a university information technology (IT) department. While our findings confirm extant KM understandings, we also develop several new insights and contradictions. Our study reveals several KM research and practice paradoxes and proposes a pluralistic/paradoxical view of KM and its related concepts such as networks, knowledge sharing, learning, and information and communication technologies. We suggest that recognizing simultaneous opposites and contradictions can improve an organization's KM efforts and can explain conflicting research findings.",,,,,"Koch, Hope/0000-0003-0169-8626",,,,,,,,,,,,0887-4417,,,,,SUM,2005,45,4,,,,,62,74,,,,,,,,,WOS:000231371500007,,,,,J,"Genuis, SK",,,,"Genuis, SK",,,Published literature and diffusion of medical innovation: Exploring innovation generation,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND LIBRARY SCIENCE-REVUE CANADIENNE DES SCIENCES DE L INFORMATION ET DE BIBLIOTHECONOMIE,,,,,,,,,,,,"This study explores the role of published literature during innovation generation; the contribution of citation-pattern evaluation in understanding the relationship between literature and slowly diffusing innovations; the influence of different types of published materials on innovation adoption; and use of non-LIS theories, particularly diffusion of innovations and strength of weak ties.

Findings suggest that citation patterns provide a unique means of investigating knowledge accumulation and consequent innovation generation, and that published literature performs the critical function of bridging a weak tie in the diffusion of information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1195-096X,,,,,MAR,2005,29,1,,,,,27,54,,,,,,,,,WOS:000237959700002,,,,,

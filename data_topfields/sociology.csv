What is missing is the perspective of social contacts who help others find jobs. Using a large data set from the 2012 China Labor-Force Dynamics Survey, this study reveals significant gender differences in the provision of job-search help. Compared with women, men are more likely to provide job-search help and especially show a greater likelihood of exerting direct influence on the hiring process. While women are gender neutral in their choice of help recipients, men display a selective preference for helping other men. This men's advantage of providing job-search help, especially influence-based help, and men's selective preference for helping other men, imply another prominent gender inequality in informal hiring in the labor market.

A Consideration of Network Content and the Social Ties That Provide It,SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The strength of weak ties is among the most important theories in the social sciences. One paradoxical element of the theory has been widely understood and valued-that weak ties connect disparate regions of social structure. Less appreciated, however, is the arguably more paradoxical implication that someone only weakly connected to another would provide value beyond that which is provided by the recipient's (ego's) strong ties. Once this paradoxical feature of the theory and associated empirical literatures is acknowledged, the interests of the resource provider (alter) demand consideration. To do so faithfully requires first, the concession that different types of content can be transmitted across ties (e.g., financial, informational, physical, social) and content varies in important ways that relate to alter's interests and concerns. This article considers social network content and the strength of ties that provide different forms of it. The case of startups is used as a fruitful strategic research site because of the varied resources required at various stages of the startup process. Novel insights are proposed concerning what content flows across different types of social relationships in the context of ""nascent"" entrepreneurship. Examples from other contexts such as job search are also discussed to exemplify scope. Importantly, this article takes the perspective of the resource provider, alter, and considers her concerns about trust, misuse, and unauthorized transfer in dyadic exchange.

By combining questionnaires, socio-metric surveys, interviews and web content analysis, we argue that the participation in this activism allows the members collective and personal empowerment online. From the data analyses, we uncover three key features of the members' Facebook usage: maintaining weak ties by balancing multiple group memberships, using tools for interactive self-identification, and being driven by networking. Additionally, the members re-contextualized their gender and class identities in positive ways, using Islam and writing. We argue that the members utilized Islam chiefly as moral yardstick and image-making, while writing as a multitasking tool and an alternative class marker for them.Through these acts of re-contextualization, the members recreate their alternative self-identifications incorporating class, religion, gender and nationality seamlessly.

Design/methodology/approach A case study of a Scottish labour market was undertaken which involved an interview-based survey of those who became unemployed in their early 50's and tried to regain employment. The interview had structured and unstructured parts which allowed both quantitative and qualitative analysis to compare those who were successful in regaining work with those who were not. The uniqueness of the paper is the use of social network components while controlling for other socio-economic and demographic variables in job search of older workers. Findings Those older people who were unemployed and, returned to employment (reemployed) had a higher proportion of contacts with higher prestige jobs, their job searching methods were mainly interpersonal and the rate of finding their last job via their social networks was higher than those who remained unemployed. Both groups mobilised social capital (MSC), but those reemployed accessed higher quality social capital. Strong ties, rather than weak ties, were found to be important in accessing and mobilising social capital for the older workers who returned to employment. Research limitations/implications This work is limited to a local labour market and is based on a small but informative sample. However, it does show that policy is required to allow older people to enhance their social networks by strengthening the social capital embedded in the networks. The results support the use of intermediaries as bridges to help compensate for older people who have weak social networks. Besides the policy implications, the paper also has two distinct research implications. First, the use of social network component to the existing literature of older workers' job search. Second, exploring the type and relational strength with network members to explain older workers' reemployment. Practical implications The paper illustrates that how accessed and MSC can be measured. Social implications As populations age, this work points to an approach to support older people to re-enter employment and to include them in society. Originality/value The paper extends social network and employment literature to fill gaps on how older people require to both access and mobilise social capital. The importance of strong ties in the reemployment of older workers contrasts with much of the literature on younger workers where the strength of weak ties so far has been regarded as essential for successful job search. Measures are forwarded to reveal the relevance of social capital. The policy value of the work is in suggesting ways to facilitate older people re-enter or remain in work and hence sustain their well-being.",,,,"McQuaid, Ronald W/K-6219-2012","McQuaid, Ronald W/0000-0002-5342-7097",,,,,,,,,,,,0144-333X,1758-6720,,,,,2019,39,6-May,,,,,356,375,,10.1108/IJSSP-07-2018-0111,,,,,,,WOS:000470923000002,,,,,J,"Patulny, R; Ramia, G; Feng, ZQ; Peterie, M; Marston, G",,,,"Patulny, Roger; Ramia, Gaby; Feng, Zhuqin; Peterie, Michelle; Marston, Greg",,,"The strong, the weak and the meaningful: Do friends or acquaintances help us get ""any"" job, or ""meaningful"" work?",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose Governments increasingly promote employment through social networks (whether via formal job networks or informal personal networks). However, they rarely account for how weak-tie bridging networks and strong-tie bonding networks differentially affect employment outcomes. Given criticism that (usually weak-tie bridging-focussed) formal job networks are overly focussed on finding entry-level (i.e. any) jobs, it is imperative to understand the impact of strong and weak ties on securing work with good conditions, or of meaning to the worker. Such links are poorly understood in the present literature. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach This study uses national Australian survey data to assess whether support from close friends or distant acquaintances is associated with employment outcomes such as finding any work or meaningful work. Findings The results show that relatively distant ties (close acquaintances) and emotional support from friends are each associated with reduced chances of being an unemployed/discouraged worker. Stronger ties (close friends) are associated with better chances of a having a meaningful job. Practical implications More attention should be paid to tie strength dynamics and meaningful employment outcomes in the delivery of employment services. In particular, a role for active close-tie brokers in promoting networks should be investigated, instead of expecting/pushing the unemployed to rely on either extremely close or distant connections.

Reciprocity is considered a principle of interpersonal and social relations, presupposing the existence of explicit and latent mutual obligations among their participants. Empirical diagnostics was centered on parameters of family-related, friendly, neighborly, professional networks of mutual aid as intensity and regularity of functioning, the focus of resource transfers, the nature of mutuality of obligations, motivation for the exchange of resources. The exchange of resources with parents and full-grown children is characterized by the highest degree of intensity. Most participants in such exchanges do not expect an equivalent volume of response services, and these interactions themselves have the character of generalized reciprocity. As we move toward ""weak"" ties (neighbors, colleagues, acquaintances), the attitude of balanced reciprocity dominates: receiving assistance, 50 to 57% of respondents expect an equivalent return. In the motivation of mutual aid, the attitude to a balanced reciprocity is most clearly expressed in professional and neighboring networks. In relations with friends, it is balanced by emotional-value and existential motives, which are dominant in family-related relationships. The normative significance of the principle of reciprocity and its system-forming character in various types of mutual aid networks is substantiated, and it has been proved that reciprocity in family ties has, first of all, an emotional-psychological and value background, in other networks of mutual aid the balanced nature of resource exchanges is a condition for their stable functioning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0132-1625,,,,,,2019,,3,,,,,106,117,,10.31857/S013216250004283-4,,,,,,,WOS:000466458400011,,,,,J,"Lubbers, MJ; Molina, JL; Valenzuela-Garcia, H",,,,"Lubbers, Miranda J.; Luis Molina, Jose; Valenzuela-Garcia, Hugo",,,When networks speak volumes: Variation in the size of broader acquaintanceship networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Personal network researchers have extensively studied the characteristics and effects of individuals' closest relationships, but they have paid much less attention to broader acquaintanceship networks, despite evidence that weak ties can also provide social support.

We designed a survey instrument based on the Network Scale-Up Method and implemented it in a national survey in Spain. Our results suggest that Spaniards have approximately 536 acquaintances, with a large inter-individual variation, comparable to the estimates reported for the American population. Acquaintanceship volume varies with gender, age, education, and income. These differences are partially related to the unequal participation of social groups in voluntary associations, confirming the civic value of such associations, and in employment.

One major theme emerged: highly involved white members described their close friends of color in utilitarian terms and not integrated into daily activities outside of the interracial organization. This theme, named the ""one friend rule,"" is a micro-level mechanism where whites mobilize a ""close"" interracial tie to project a generalized value for diversity while simultaneously limiting access to personal resources.

In line with previous research on support networks, we find a strong reliance on strong ties in providing instrumental and emotional support (e.g., Wellman and Wortley, 1990) but also that distance matters (e.g., Mok et al., 2010) and shapes the network mobilisation strategies of the working mothers. Locally based weak ties, based on various forms of reciprocity, are supplemental in providing ad-hoc crisis support when transnational ties cannot be mobilized.

Because resource scarcity experienced by members of immigrant communities is likely to disrupt normatively expected reciprocal support, we explored multi-level predictors of exchange processes with personal network members that involve (1) only receiving support, (2) only providing support, and (3) reciprocal support exchanges. We focus on an understudied case of Central Asian migrant women in the Russian Federation using a sample of 607 women from three ethnic groups Kyrgyz, Tajik, Uzbek who were surveyed in two large Russian cities-Nizhny Novgorod and Kazan. The survey collected information on respondents' demographic, socioeconomic, and migration-related characteristics, as well as characteristics of up to five individuals with whom they had a close relationship. Multi-level multinomial regression analyses were used to account for the nested nature of the data. Our results revealed that closer social relationships (siblings and friends) and greater levels of resources (income and regularized legal status) at both ego and alter levels were positively related to providing, receiving, and reciprocally exchanging financial and emotional support. Egos were more likely to provide financial assistance to transnational alters, whereas they were more likely to engage in mutual exchanges of emotional support with their network members from other countries. Personal network size and density showed no relationship with support exchanges.

Using an essay-based study of 78 youth (mean age 15.5 years), the effects of internet anonymity on relationships were examined. Results of the qualitative thematic approach showed that anonymity online has led to new forms of relational risk, stemming from misplaced trust or deception. Anonymity was also seen as lessening barriers to relational intimacy, as weak ties could transition to strong ties based on shared interests or social validation. Anonymity was also viewed as enhancing interactive courage and self-expression. Harassment and other negative behaviours were strengthened through anonymity. The dynamics between strong and weak ties were central to risks; here, social tie deception was found to cause harm where an aggressor feigned strong ties in the pursuit of instrumental gain.

I engage social exchange frameworks to show that reciprocal exchanges that generated intangible rewards for teachers, such as gratitude and purpose, helped maintain mentorships.

The context in which teachers interacted with mentees and the form of support they had given also influenced their evaluations of reciprocity.

We analyse two indicators of informal social capital: having social contact with friends, family or work colleagues and having anyone to discuss intimate and personal matters with. The results show that the more governments spend on social protection, the more likely people within those countries are to have social and intimate contact. The results also demonstrate that within-country effects of the types of social spending on having social contact disappear once we control for unobserved heterogeneity between countries.

Bridging the organizational boundary provides the novelty; and secondhand closure provides the cooperation. Further, by examining who in the network is constraining these contacts, we are able to trace their cooperative motivation both to reputational and organizational identity concerns, which each create a spillover of cooperation toward the focal individual, who reaps the returns.

However, other studies of social networks in the labor market propose that the likelihood of information transmission might depend on strength of the tie; and that tie strength is a potentially important source of the tie's value. After all, even if job seekers have social ties to those who have valuable job information, the seekers will gain little information benefit when the ties do not actually transmit the information. This paper clarifies the conditions under which social ties might provide information benefits. We use a survey vignette experiment and ask MBA students about their likelihood of relaying job information via strong ties (to friends) or weak ties (to acquaintances), holding constant the structural locations spanned by the tie and job seekers' fit with the job. The results support the claim that strength of tie has a causal effect on the chances of information transmission: potential referrers are more likely to relay job information to their friends than to acquaintances. The larger implication of these findings is that whatever benefits there might be to using weak ties to reach distant non-redundant information during job search, these benefits need to be considered against the likely fact that people connected via weak ties are less likely to actually share information about job opportunities than are people to whom the job seeker is strongly tied.

In this paper we propose generalized measures, where a tuning parameter 8 regulates the relative impact of resources held by more close versus more distant others. We first show how, when a specific 8 is chosen degree-centrality and reciprocal closeness centrality are two specific instances of this more general measure. We then demonstrate how a similar approach can be applied to node-level measures that incorporate attributes. When more or less weight is given to other nodes at longer distances with specific characteristics, a generalized measure of resource-richness and a generalized measure for diversity among one's connections can be obtained (following Blau's measure of heterogeneity). Finally, we show how this approach can also be applied to betweenness centrality to focus on more local (ego) betweenness or global (Freeman) betweenness.

We conclude by arguing that fleeting encounters are no longer connections that either persist or completely fade away after face-to-face interaction. Rather, they often persist through technology-mediated communications in ways that result in, at minimum, the development of weak ties. This greater relationship persistence can permit more opportunity to get to know a potential partner in digitally mediated settings like Facebook or via texting, but it could also require newstrategies to evade interested others given this new lack of ephemerality and the influx of weak ties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0195-6086,1533-8665,,,,FEB,2017,40,1,,,,,25,42,,10.1002/SYMB.268,,,,,,,WOS:000397090400002,,,,,B,"Spier, S","Spier, S",,,"Spier, Shaked","Spier, S",,The Social Network: The Relevance of Weak and Strong Ties for Mobilization Over Social Media,COLLECTIVE ACTION 2.0: THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON COLLECTIVE ACTION,Chandos Publishing Social Media Series,,,,,,,,,,,"The interplay between social networks, weak and strong ties, and social media in the context of collective action is a subject of controversial academic debate, especially in light of the wave of protests and related discourse around 2011.

What exactly are 'weak ties', how are they created and what resources flow through them?

Interrogating the concept of 'weak ties', I argue that tie strength and ethnic composition are less important than relative social distance and willingness to share valuable resources.

Specifically, I suggest that there are three types of institutional affiliations. First, the primary affiliation is composed of groups in which members share strong ties and bond together with personal, empathic, and enduring relationships. Second, the secondary affiliation comprises certain associations that seek to achieve their proclaimed goals within or beyond their collectivities, in the latter case possibly reaching to the level of a wider community or a whole society. Lastly, the dual affiliation exists as an intersection between the two prior affiliations. Using a nationally representative data set from Korea, the study found that both primary and secondary affiliations are related to occupational status, whereas only the secondary affiliation is associated with civic actions.

To date, few studies have addressed the long term evolution of social capital-based relationships. In this article, we assess the evolving role of social capital in an agricultural co-operative, using the development of machinery rings in Scotland as a case-study. Drawing on Bourdieu's conceptualisation of capital exchange, we explore the establishment, formalisation, and commoditisation of different capitals embedded in the rings. Findings demonstrate that a range of capital types was important at each stage of machinery ring development, enabling them to evolve in relation to the changes affecting the agriculture industry in Scotland. Early adoption of advanced information technologies enabled the mobilisation of network resources and successful service provision across increasing geographical scales. Through formalisation, the rings became sources of human, social, and economic capitals - access to which could be purchased by new ring members. This formalisation process ultimately led to the establishment of the rings as economically viable businesses, but also a shift in identity from farmer collaboration to commercial service provision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-0199,1467-9523,,,,OCT,2016,56,4,,,,,471,490,,10.1111/soru.12092,,,,,,,WOS:000384986300001,,,,,J,"Giannella, E; Fischer, CS",,,,"Giannella, Eric; Fischer, Claude S.",,,An inductive typology of egocentric networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,,,,,,,,,,,"We apply Random Forests to detailed survey data of social relations in order to derive an inductive typology of egocentric networks.

A two-level approach enables a simultaneous analysis of potential individual-level and firm-level driving forces of workplace social capital surveyed from 1244 employees of 116 firms. Individual endowments of social and institutional trust are strongly associated with increased rates of workplace social capital at the employee level. High-trust individuals also appear to be clustered in firms, which is evidence for a sorting effect and the potential impact of a firm's embeddedness in the local area. Aggregated firm rates of workplace social capital are influenced by some of the management tools analysed such as focus on worker's health and work-life balance. In addition, we find that workplace social capital has a sizable and beneficial impact on satisfaction with obtained wage indicated by employees which is assumed to be a fundamental precondition for high work effort.

The notion of social embeddedness expresses the shift from the macro and micro levels of analysis to the meso level, disclosing the influence of weak ties (friends, peers and co-workers) and network mechanisms on bearing children and becoming parents. The integration of social influence models into the research on fertility behavior enables students to explain the gap between intentions to have a child and actually becoming a parent in terms of interaction between weak and strong ties. The impact of network mechanisms is tested for different number of births, timing of marriage, and transition to parenthood. Several types of network mechanisms are distinguished: social learning, social contagion, social pressure and social support. Social learning concerns circulation of relevant information and experience exchange with friends, peers and co-workers. Social support involves mobilization of strong and weak ties for material and emotional maintenance in pregnancy, childbearing, childcare, and decision making on new births. Social learning and social support play a decisive role in reducing uncertainty and costs related to childbearing and childcare, especially for countries will low levels of economic sustainability and generalized trust. Social contagion and social pressure are mechanisms that express vertical and horizontal processes of social diffusion related to the spread of social norms and settings on marriage and parenthood.

The central focus of this paper is the interpretation of the diverging correlations observed between the dimensions elaborated on an individual and an aggregate level. We illustrate that the correlations of regionally aggregated components are the result of an improper application of a single-level model to a multilevel structure. This mechanism is demonstrated empirically by adopting results from the European Social Survey and elaborating dimensions of social capital from both individual and aggregate survey data for European regions. The findings clearly indicate that the observed ecological correlations are not simply spurious or inconsistent due to an ecological fallacy condition, but rather reflect the influence of regional driving forces.

I hypothesise that social connectedness influences the money-happiness relationship because the effect of money is in part felt through the acquisition of social status, whereas status (and associated psychological benefits such as self-worth) can alternatively be gained through social connectedness. In particular, it is theorised that 'weak ties' when co-existing with good quality informal ties have a separable and additional benefit to subjective well-being, and that it is the socially isolated who have the most to gain from doing well financially. Social connectedness is conceptualised as a 'resilience resource' which has a buffering effect on subjective well-being. Data from the British Household Panel Survey are used, first to establish a measurement schema of connectedness using latent class analysis, and secondly in a multilevel model of life satisfaction with observations from seven consecutive years nested within individuals. The results show that connectedness makes a larger difference to satisfaction in times of financial stress, and that the satisfaction of the socially isolated can 'catch up' to some degree with those with larger networks when things are going well financially. The findings also confirm that those for whom money makes the smallest contribution to happiness are those with both strong and weak ties. Weak ties have an additional benefit compared to having strong ties alone. In summary, connectedness has the power to narrow the well-being gap that exists between times of financial struggle and times of relative comfort. It suggests that the psychological benefits of social integration have the capacity to displace money as a source of status and self-worth, and similarly that the importance of money may be exaggerated where these psychological gains are not available through other domains of life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0303-8300,1573-0921,,,,JAN,2016,125,2,,,,,509,535,,10.1007/s11205-014-0858-5,,,,,,,WOS:000368192900007,26770011,,,,J,"Brashears, ME; Hoagland, E; Quintane, E",,,,"Brashears, Matthew E.; Hoagland, Emily; Quintane, Eric",,,Sex and network recall accuracy,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,,,,,,,,,,,"How does an individual's sex influence their recall of social relations? Extensive research has shown that social networks differ by sex and has attempted to explain these differences either through structural availability or individual preferences. Addressing the limitations of these explanations, we build on an increasing body of research emphasizing the role of cognition in the formation and maintenance of networks to argue that males and females may exhibit different strategies for encoding and recalling social information in memory. Further, because activating sex roles can alter cognitive performance, we propose that differences in recall may only or primarily appear when respondents are made aware of their sex. We explore differences in male and female network memory using a laboratory experiment asking respondents to memorize and recall a novel social network after receiving either a sex prime or a control prime. We find that sex significantly impacts social network recall, however being made aware of one's sex does not. Our results provide evidence that differences in male and female networks may be partly due to sex-based differences in network cognition. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Using pooled data from three cross-sectional surveys in urban China, the results show a steady increase in the use of weak ties and an increasing and persistent use of strong ties in finding jobs between 1978 and 2008.

Both countries have transformed from authoritarian regimes to democratic states, yet they differ in social, economic, and cultural institutions that may be common to the respective larger region where each is located. To sample the structure of each egocentric network, we extracted information from largely identical contact diaries collected in both countries, 51 from Taiwan and 138 from Hungary. After comparing sample characteristics, network size, and composition, we construct a Strength of Ties (SoT) index based on two objective and two subjective measures of ego-alter ties. We then use this index to analyze tie strength by the types of relationships. On average, the number of alters contacted in one week is much larger in Taiwan than in Hungary, and the gap remains unchanged after controlling for key socio-demographic background factors. Even though the four indicators that we use to construct the SoT index are distributed similarly among the respondents in both Taiwan and Hungary, the composite index pinpoints how the types of relationships play somewhat different roles across the nations. The findings imply that the tendency to maintain only the closest ties with kin and other close friends is linked to distrust in others, a possible ill effect lingering from the authoritarian past. The implication is partially supported by further analyses using the ISSP 2006 survey data.

Bridging is a dimension of social capital, usually related to weak ties (acquaintances), and a source of instrumental resources such as information. The study surveyed a stratified random sample of 417 inhabitants of Lisbon, Portugal.

Thus, a growing body of research has been looking into the relationship between social capital and Internet usage. This research has been showing a positive relationship between them; however, results are not as conclusive when we consider one of the main dimensions of social capital: bonding. Bonding relates to resources that are embedded in one's strong ties (i.e., family members and close friends). The study of bonding is of particular sociological interest, since the discussion around the social effects of the Internet still suggests that it takes time away from strong ties and that is more useful to connect with weak ties (i.e., acquaintances). This study examines the relationship between bonding and the Internet, using representative survey data and semi-structured interviews from Portugal. Findings show that bonding is predicted positively by Internet use but negatively by age. On one hand, the Internet seems to compensate for the negative age effect because older adults who use it are more likely to have a high level of bonding.

In a large-scale Chinese survey, we find that 59% of the 4350 wage earners land on jobs through social contacts from whom the benefits of information and forms of favoritism are gained. Data analysis shows that (1) both weak ties and strong ties are used by Chinese job seekers to obtain information and favoritism to help secure job opportunities, but (2) weak ties are better able to channel job information than strong ties and strong ties are better able to mobilize forms of favoritism than weak ties, (3) information and favoritism equally promote job-worker matching, which in turn increases wage, and (4) favoritism has a stronger effect than does information on job assignment to positions of superior earning opportunity.

This study examined the effects of social network factors on information acquisition and adoption of new seed varieties among groundnut farmers in Uganda and Kenya. The data were generated through face-to-face interviews from a random sample of 461 farmers, 232 in Uganda and 229 in Kenya. To assess these effects two alternative econometric models were used: a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit (SUBP) model and a recursive bivariate probit (RBP) model. The statistical evaluation of the SUBP shows that information acquisition and adoption decisions are interrelated while tests for the RBP do not support this latter model. Therefore, the analysis is based on the results obtained from the SUBP. These results reveal that social network factors, particularly weak ties with external support (e.g., researchers, extension agents, etc.), partially influence information acquisition, but do not influence adoption. In Uganda, external support, gender, farm size, and geographic location have an impact on information acquisition. In Kenya, external support and geographic location also have an impact on information acquisition. With regard to adoption, gender, household size, and geographic location play the most important roles for Ugandan farmers, while in Kenya information from external sources, education, and farm size affect adoption choice. The study provides insight on the importance of external weak ties in groundnut farming, and a need to understand regional differences along gender lines while developing agricultural strategies.

We explore the role of social networks as drivers of system transformation within dairy production in the eastern United States, specifically rotational grazing as an alternative management option. We hypothesize the importance of weak ties within farmer social networks as drivers of change. In Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and New York, we conducted 53 interviews with confinement, low-intensity, and rotational grazing dairy producers as well as 35 interviews with associated network actors. Though confinement and grazier networks had similar proportions of strong and weak ties, confinement producers had more market-based weak ties, while graziers had more weak-ties to government agencies and other graziers in the region. These agency weak ties supported rotational graziers through information exchange and cost sharing, both crucial to farmers' transitions from confinement-based production to grazing systems. While weak ties were integral to initial innovation, farmers did not maintain these relationships beyond their transition to grazing. Of equal importance, grazier weak-tie networks did not include environmental organizations, suggesting unrealized potential for more diverse networks based on environmental services.

In finance, the labor market values the assets that financial operatives take with them from one firm to another, such as knowledge, know-how and customers. Since assets are to a certain extent shared among co-workers, it is worth hiring business relations and former colleagues or moving in teams: this enables a better transfer of assets such as idiosyncratic work routines, distributed knowledge, or joint customers. To demonstrate our claims we rely on an online survey launched with eFinancialCareers.fr collected in September 2008 among French financial employees.

In contrast to such theories, we propose that path dependency coupled with enhancement of human and social capital enables some adolescents who work to find more attractive jobs later in life. Methodology - Using the longitudinal Youth in Transition Survey (YITS) spanning over 10 years, we find support for a positive relationship between adolescents' number of work hours and future desirable professional outcomes such as being employed, income, person-organization fit, knowing where to look for a job, and career networking. Findings - The positive relationship, in many instances, is curvilinear and highlights the downfall of working excessive hours. We also explore whether adolescent work for a stranger or family member leads to different outcomes, and find that working in a family business leads to enhanced later life utilization of career networks as well as better person-organization fit. Social implications - While we find that adolescent work intensity is linked to positive later life outcomes such as higher income, better fitting jobs, and better career networks, we also find maxima whereby additional hours worked have a diminishing effect on the outcomes.

The Diffusion of Tactical Innovation in Social Movement Networks, the Case of Suffragette Militancy",SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper explores the diffusion of a tactical innovation - militancy - within the British Suffrage Movement, 1905 - 1914. It concentrates upon the influences that arise from personal social networks and which affect ego's decision about whether to adopt the new tactic. UCINET is used to map and visualise the activist networks of two suffragettes who made different adoption decisions. This reveals that 'weak ties' to 'innovation champions' (i. e. suffragette 'travelling organisers') connected both women to opportunities to learn about, observe and adopt militancy. In order to explain why one suffragette adopted the tactic and the other did not, however, there is a need to link structural and cultural analyses of social networks together. Here, I do this by following up empirically what Fuhse [Fuhse, J. (2009). The meaning structure of social networks. Sociological Theory, 27, 51-73] has called the 'meaning structure of the network' consisting of interpersonal expectations and network culture. I propose that the 'meaning structure' of the network is linked to the structural patterning of social ties - and the subjective meanings of ego - through the communicative interaction in which they both are rooted [Mische, A. (2003). Cross-talk in movements: Rethinking the culture-network link. In M. Diani & D. McAdam (Eds.), Social movements and networks: Relational approaches to collective action (pp. 258 - 280). Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press]. Focusing on communicative interaction and intersubjective meanings indicates that there is value in approaching personal networks as socio-cultural 'lifeworlds' [Habermas, J. (1987). The theory of communicative action, volume 2: System and lifeworld. Boston, MA: Beacon Press; Passy, F., & Giugni, M. (2000).

We test this interpretation using two Italian parties of the 1970s that played major roles in shaping political and social life of the country: the Christian Democrats, or DC, and the Communists, or PCI. The 1970s saw the culmination of the DC and PCI's two-party dominance of the Italian state. Further, it was during this same period that the economic and social contradictions of Italy's tumultuous post-World War II process of industrialization became apparent, making social cleavages easy to grasp. We use cosponsoring of bills between parliamentary members as a measure of formal and informal relationships within each party. We deem this appropriate in the context of a pure proportional electoral system and highly polarized audiences. Data comes from the lower chamber of the Parliament during the Sixth Legislative cycle (1972-1977). We use HLM to model dyadic interactions between MPs and distinguish between repeated cosponsoring of bills (strong ties) and single occurrences of cosponsoring (weak ties). Our results show that within each party, national cleavages significantly increased the likelihood of strong ties but were not relevant in structuring weak ties. We conclude that the party has an internal structure made of a network of MPs informed by external social cleavages and held together by the common goal of being reelected. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

By contrast, Chinese Singaporeans have greater access to forms of social capital such as ties to university graduates, private housing dwellers, Chinese, and weak ties, than do other ethnicities. These distinctive patterns of network inequalities are bound up with distinctive patterns of access to organizations such as schools, workplaces, and voluntary associations. The paper finds that network inequalities among gender and ethnic groups have more to do with barriers of entry to those organizations and less to do with social capital being added more efficaciously for some members.

For nearly thirty years, social network researchers have argued that the network is composed of ego's closest or most important alters. This assumption, however, has not been tested empirically. Using original data on an online representative quota survey of 2000 respondents, I find that 45% of the core discussion network is composed of people whom respondents do not consider important to them. In fact, the core discussion network includes doctors, co-workers, spiritual leaders, and other alters whom ego confides in without feeling emotionally attached to. I examine what respondents consider important matters and why they approach weak ties to discuss these. Placing emphasis on the process through which ego mobilizes alters, I develop two theoretical perspectives, which focus on how people identify those appropriate to a topic and how they respond to opportunities in interactional contexts. Findings suggest that ego discusses important matters with non-close alters at times because they are known to be knowledgeable (targeted mobilization) and at times because they are available when important issues arise (opportune mobilization). Results suggest that recent findings about changes in the core discussion network of Americans are consistent with several different possibilities about the nature of strong ties, including those in which there has been no change at all.

Using the European Social Survey 2002/2003, we examine variations in the gender gap in associational involvement in a cross-national context. We find systematic variation in the gender gap that cannot be explained solely by individual attributes. Using multilevel Poisson regression models and employing a gendered version of the theory of social origins of civil society (Salamon & Anheier, 1998), we find that women in the social democratic countries have the highest participation rates, followed by women in conservative and liberal regimes. In Mediterranean and post-socialist countries, women face a dual disadvantage. Their average number of voluntary association memberships is low, both in absolute terms and in comparison to their male counterparts. This study reveals a complex relationship between societal context and the gender gap in associational involvement.

Using in-depth interviews with entry-level white collar workers I show that information holders with opportunities to mention specific jobs to specific people do so only 27% of the time. Because they hesitate to share information if they are uncertain the information is specifically sought, information flows more commonly to strong ties, whose career goals are more likely to be known. Information is more likely to be shared with weak ties if it concerns occupations for which one may be specifically credentialed, since receiving relevant training serves as signal of interest in such jobs. These finding suggest that the homophily of referrals and their inequality-generating effects may vary across occupations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To resolve this confusion, we need to theorize how specific characteristics of ties are related to the mechanisms that make job search through contacts effective. We have reasons to expect that, while a contact's motivation influences the likelihood that a job seeker receives an offer, her homophily with the job seeker on occupation and other job-relevant attributes influences the quality of the offer. The use of strong ties among university students to find jobs in China provides a unique opportunity to empirically isolate the relationship between contact characteristics and the mechanisms through which contacts benefit the job seeker. I tested my hypotheses with data on both the successful and unsuccessful job searches of 478 graduates of China's flagship universities, who, as first-time job seekers, primarily used strong ties. Survey results are consistent with my hypotheses: job seekers who used strong ties to look for jobs had more offers-but not better offers-than those who used only formal methods.

Paisanos are more likely to help at the beginning of the migratory flow of the community (rural or urban), and family members to do so once the flow has matured. Also, paisanos are more likely to help those in rural areas during more difficult times, such as after the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

This article examines the comparative effectiveness of different types of social ties used by a job seeker and proposes an explanation for the inconsistency in empirical evidence for strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis. Methods. Granovetter's strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis predicted that in a job search, weak ties (acquaintances) are a more valuable source of information as compared to strong ties (close friends or relatives). However, subsequent empirical research has provided ambiguous support for this hypothesis. To sort out the conflicting results, a mathematical model of the transmission of job information through a contact network has been constructed. Along with the strength of tie, a widely used characteristic of contact, the model also incorporates the work relation of tie. Results. The model has numerous implications with strong empirical support, as well as propositions going beyond the findings of prior empirical work, which can be evaluated in subsequent studies. It is shown that the effectiveness of a certain type of contact depends on both the ego's status (weak and work-related contacts are more advantageous for higher-status workers) and the composition of the ego's network (work-related contacts promote the effectiveness of weak ties, while strong-tie contacts hinder the effectiveness of work-related ties). In particular, it implies that the inconsistency in empirical evidence for the strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis can be explained by the differences in status or the proportion of work-related contacts in the samples examined. Conclusion. Work-related ties play a significant role in the analysis of informal job-search methods; their incorporation into the model allows one to account for a number of previously unexplained empirical results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-4941,,,,,DEC,2011,92,4,,,,,1118,1132,,10.1111/j.1540-6237.2011.00806.x,,,,,,,WOS:000296383500012,,,,,J,"McDonald, S",,,,"McDonald, Steve",,,What You Know or Who You Know?

Results from fixed effects regression on panel data from the NLSY show that experience is related to informal entry into new jobs, though in a very specific way. The odds of being informally recruited into a new job improve as work experience in related occupations rises, but this relationship holds only among men. These findings highlight the social benefits of occupation-specific work experience that accrue to men but not to women, suggesting an alternative explanation for the gender disparity in wage returns to experience.

Through tight bonds of trust and reciprocity, these networks are considered to be sources of social capital, providing a counter-balance to the disadvantages that migrants may encounter in the destination society. This paper argues that more attention is needed to the ways in which migrants access, maintain and construct different types of networks, in varied social locations, with diverse people. I suggest that the often simplistic dichotomy of bonding and bridging capital needs to be re-appraised and instead offer an alternative way of thinking about these social ties. The distinction between them tends to be understood on the basis of the ethnicity of the people involved-bonding involves close ties with 'people like us' while bridging involves links beyond 'group cleavages'. Insufficient attention has been paid to the actual resources flowing between these ties or the kinds of relationship developing between the actors involved. The nature of these social networks may be better understood by focusing on the relationship between the actors, their relative social location, and their available and realisable resources.

We extend this literature by connecting alcohol use, dating, and peers to understand the diffusion of drinking behavior in school-based friendship networks. Drawing on Granovetter's classic concept of weak ties, we argue that adolescent romantic partners are likely to be network bridges, or liaisons, connecting daters to new peer contexts that, in turn, promote changes in individual drinking behaviors and allow these behaviors to spread across peer networks. Using longitudinal data of 449 couples from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate Actor-Partner Interdependence Models and identify unique contributions of partners' drinking, friends' drinking, and friends-of-partners' drinking to daters' own future binge drinking and drinking frequency. Findings support the liaison hypothesis and suggest that friends-of-partners' drinking have net associations with adolescent drinking patterns. Moreover, the coefficient for friends-of-partners' drinking is larger than the coefficient for one's own peers and generally immune to prior selection.

This is due to tremendous difficulties in data acquisition of social systems. Massive multiplayer online games (MMOG) provide a fascinating new way of observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously socially interacting individuals engaged in virtual economic activities. We have compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players over a period of 3 years from a MMOG played by 300,000 people. This large-scale data set of a socio-economic unit contains all social and economic data from a single and coherent source. Players have to generate a virtual income through economic activities to 'survive' and are typically engaged in a multitude of social activities offered within the game. Our analysis of high-frequency log files focuses on three types of social networks, and tests a series of social-dynamics hypotheses. In particular we study the structure and dynamics of friend-, enemy- and communication networks. We find striking differences in topological structure between positive (friend) and negative (enemy) tie networks. All networks confirm the recently observed phenomenon of network densification. We propose two approximate social laws in communication networks, the first expressing betweenness centrality as the inverse square of the overlap, the second relating communication strength to the cube of the overlap. These empirical laws provide strong quantitative evidence for the Weak ties hypothesis of Granovetter. Further, the analysis of triad significance profiles validates well-established assertions from social balance theory. We find overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of complete (incomplete) triads in networks of positive ties, and vice versa for networks of negative ties. Empirical transition probabilities between triad classes provide evidence for triadic closure with extraordinarily high precision. For the first time we provide empirical results for large-scale networks of negative social ties. Whenever possible we compare our findings with data from non-virtual human groups and provide further evidence that online game communities serve as a valid model for a wide class of human societies. With this setup we demonstrate the feasibility for establishing a 'socio-economic laboratory' which allows to operate at levels of precision approaching those of the natural sciences.

A contrasting line of research demonstrates that triads in empirical social networks are well predicted by lower order graph features (density and dyads), accounting for around 90% of the variability in triad distributions when comparing different social networks (Faust, 2006, 2007, 2008). These two sets of results present a puzzle: how can substantial triadic tendencies occur when triads in empirical social networks are largely explained by lower order graph features? This paper provides insight into the puzzle by considering constraints that lower order graph features place on the triad census. Taking a comparative perspective, it shows that triad censuses from 159 social networks of diverse species and social relations are largely explained by their lower order graph features (the dyad census) through formal constraints that force triads to occur in narrow range of configurations. Nevertheless, within these constraints, a majority of networks exhibit significant triadic patterning by departing from expectation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In fact, the museum and its professionals cannot continue to control - to use technical and 'cold' devices to discipline subjects - but have to care by fostering a 'warm' world of people.

Non-obtrusive analysis of over eight years of user activity from a large, active online community suggests that the development of multiplex relationships - relationships maintained both online and offline enhances attendees' engagement with the online community as a whole, strengthens ties to other attendees, and contributes to the creation of bonding social capital.

To date, however, there have been few direct comparisons of job-finding in urban and rural settings (see Lindsay et al., 2005; Wahba and Zenou, 2005). Using data from two major surveys and a qualitative interview project, we uncover several important differences in urban and rural paths to employment.

Second, we find much stronger evidence of differentiation within rural regions. Long-time rural residents are much more likely to use strong and weak ties to find employment than are newcomers. However, rural residents who used weak ties as paths to employment have significantly lower incomes. None of these patterns are evident in the cities. Together, these findings lead us to conclude that job-finding in rural settings is strongly affected by constraints - in the labour market and in social capital resources - that are not present in cities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-0261,,,,,MAY,2009,57,2,,,,,306,330,,10.1111/j.1467-954X.2009.01831.x,,,,,,,WOS:000265713700005,,,,,J,"Hipp, JR; Perrin, AJ",,,,"Hipp, John R.; Perrin, Andrew J.",,,The Simultaneous Effect of Social Distance and Physical Distance on the Formation of Neighborhood Ties,CITY & COMMUNITY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Prior studies have separately suggested the importance of physical distance or social distance effects for the creation of neighborhood ties.

The authors find that physical distance reduces the likelihood of weak or strong ties forming, suggesting the importance of accounting for propinquity when estimating social tie formation. The authors simultaneously find that social distance along wealth reduces the likelihood of weak ties forming. Social distance on life course markers-age, marital status, and the presence of children-reduces the formation of weak ties. Consistent with the systemic model, each additional month of shared residence in the neighborhood increases both weak and strong ties.

S. population for the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics. I analyze the distribution of ownership stakes at both the individual and group levels. Findings - The results suggest that principles of macrojustice, affecting the distribution of resources in teams as a whole, deviate considerably from principles of microjustice, affecting the resources received by individual entrepreneurs. While aggregate inequality increases in teams that have a diverse set of members, the effect is not reducible to discrimination on the basis of individual status characteristics. Instead, the relational demography of teams - characterized in terms of the degree of closeness in network ties and homogeneity in demographic attributes serves as a uniquely social predictor of between-group variation in economic inequality.

Despite this robustness, we have less information about how personal characteristics relate to differences in the strength of homophily.

The present study compares the strength of age, religious, and educational homophily for male and female non-kin ties using network data from the 1985 General Social Survey. It also compares the patterning of ties among dissimilar alters for both sexes. The results of this exploratory effort indicate that males and females are almost equally homophilous, although religious homophily exerts a stronger influence on females than males. Males and females do, however, differ in their tendency to associate with certain types of dissimilar alters. Education is essentially uniform for both sexes, religious difference is more important for females than males, and those over sixty or under thirty are less different from the middle categories of age for females than for males. The results suggest that males are able to bridge larger areas of social space in their non-kin interpersonal networks and likely accumulate greater social capital as a consequence.

This new structure consists of a pair of central egos and their direct links with alters, instead of just one central ego as in the egocentered networks or multiple egos as in complete networks. The key point in this kind of network is that ties exist between the central pair of egos and between them and all alters, but the ties among alters are not considered. Duocentered networks can also be considered as a compromise between egocentered and complete networks. Complete network measurements are often costly to obtain and tend to contain a large proportion of missing data (especially for peripheral actors). Egocentered network data are less costly but a lot of information is lost with their use when a pair of individuals is the relevant unit of analysis. From the definition of duocentered networks, we develop new social network measures, some of which based on the measures for complete networks such as degree, closeness centrality or density, both absolute and relative, while others are tailored to dealing with specific characteristics of the duocentered network structures. The proposed measures are used in the analysis of the networks of Slovenian PhD students and their supervisors. We specify three regression models to predict PhD student's academic performance on the basis of these duocentered network measures for different relations such as advice, collaboration, emotional support, and trust. The results show that absolute duocentered measures predict performance best. When compared with egocentered network measures a higher predictive power of duocentered networks is revealed.

The author builds on Bourdieu ([1986] 2001) classic statement on the 'forms of capital"" (economic, social, and cultural) and the conversion dynamics among them, and on DiMaggio (1987) connection between cultural tastes and sociability. He hypothesizes that (1) in addition to cultural tastes being determined by network relations, cultural tastes are used to form and sustain those networks. Furthermore he expects that (2) highbrow culture taste will be less likely to be converted into social capital beyond immediate strong-tie circles due to its more restricted, ""asset-specific"" nature. Because of its generalized appeal, taste for popular culture will be more likely to be associated with weak-tie network density. The results broadly support these hypotheses: a model that specifies an effect of culture on network density provides a better fit to the data than the traditional conception of networks as determining taste.

In support of SWT the results show that a worker is more likely to get a job through one of her weak ties rather than strong ties. The advantages of weak ties lie in their abilities to provide timely access to non-redundant information and to influence employers directly.

Sociological theories of deviant behavior have not been systematically applied to the problem of who uses and who does not use cyberpornography on the Internet.

It tests a blended theoretical perspective, which includes measures from social control and opportunity theories of deviance, as well as measures of broader deviant lifestyles, as possible predictors of use of cyberporn. A key hypothesis is that persons with the strongest ties to conventional society will be less likely than others to use cyberporn. Methods. Complete data on 531 Internet users are taken from the General Social Surveys for 2000. Social bonds measures include religious, marital, and political ties. Measures of participation in sexual and drug-related deviant lifestyles, and demographic controls are included. Results. The results of a logistic regression analysis found that among the strongest predictors of use of cyberporn were weak ties to religion and lack of a happy marriage. However, past sexual deviance (e.g., involvement in paid sex) was also a strong predictor of cyberporn use. Overall the model explained 40 percent of the variance in porn use on the Internet.

In particular, self selection, the acquisition of human capital (leadership qualities), and the establishment of an effective social network will be considered. The analyses which are based on the Swiss Labor Market Survey 1998 show, first of all, that higher military ranks go hand in hand with higher monetary income even when controlling for education and work experience. Second, the income premium does not seem to be based on mechanisms of self-selection nor on the acquisition of particularly profitable human capital. Rather it is to be assumed that the greater professional success of Swiss militia officers is due to their rich social network of ""valuable"" ties.",,,,"Jann, Ben/O-1237-2019; Jann, Ben/A-5655-2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-1804,,,,,APR,2003,32,2,,,,,139,155,,,,,,,,,WOS:000183309600003,,,,,J,"Wuthnow, R",,,,"Wuthnow, R",,,Religious involvement and status-bridging social capital,JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION,,,,,,,,,,,,"Is religious involvement positively associated with having influential friends or is religious involvement unrelated to this kind of social capital?

Previous social network studies tend to treat the characteristics of social ties through which information is acquired as causes that may affect instrumental outcomes. However, little research has directly examined the spread of information via social ties and the tie effect on information dissemination. Using telephone survey data collected after the outbreak of an extensive commercial rumor in Hong Kong, the present paper investigates the characteristics of social ties through which the information is spread and the tie effect on information dissemination. Results show that while mass media, particularly television, serves as a major channel of information flow, social ties are also widely used. Individuals tend to share information with strong ties, or people with whom they perceive to have good relations. However, information transmitted via kin ties tends to arrive at the respondent faster than via nonkin ties or other communication channels. Implications of the findings are discussed.

In this paper it is argued that people invest in relationships with certain others partly in order to solve these problems. Hence, the personal networks that result provide solutions to system-induced problems and they reflect the institutional environment. Personal networks of people living in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) during communism are examined, and social capital theory is used to explain why communism did not produce social integration. In a communist society like that of the former GDR, weak ties are a liability, not an asset. Therefore, GDR citizens trusted only people whom they knew well, Since people in the former GDR were acutely aware of political control and the damage potential of weak ties, they invested only cautiously in others. They kept their distance from strangers and all others whose trustworthiness was uncertain and discussed politics only with people whom they truly trusted (the 'niche'). Yet the shortages of the command economy forced people to rely on weak informal ties to secure necessary goods and services. Personal networks in East Germany had two specialized parts each kept separate from the other, a division of labor that vanished after the fall of the Wall. Our hypotheses are tested using multilevel models and triad analyses with data collected in 1992 and 1994 from two random samples in Leipzig and Dresden (n = 489). The first measurement focuses on the situation before the upheaval, the other the situation in 1994. Results show that during communism people indeed created 'niches' consisting of dense, small networks of close relations with similar and trustworthy others. Provision networks were maintained that were small, heterogeneous, and consisted of weak and uniplex ties. Furthermore, there was a relational 'gap' between the niche and the provision network.

There appear to be no good predictors of individuals' proportional level of forgetting, although the number of persons an individual recalls is moderately positively correlated with the number of persons he or she forgets. People seem to be more likely to forget weak ties than strong ties, but the evidence is mixed on this point. In any event, people still forget a significant proportion of their close contacts. Non-specific prompting for additional relevant persons, multiple elicitation questions, and re-interviewing enhance recall slightly to moderately and are the only methods currently available to counteract forgetting, albeit only partially.

As expected, the data suggest that an individual's level of involvement is increased by strong ties to other members, structural similarity to other high-level members, and fewer ties to nonmembers. Extramovement organizational affiliations are often assumed to diminish actors' structural availability, though empirical research in differential recruitment has generally revealed a positive effect on participation in social movements. This study addresses a microstructural explanation for the variation between competition and mutualism in a local multiorganizational field, as it shows how organizational goals condition the effect of outside affiliations on level of participation.

The overlap existing between waged and unwaged work can be understood only by looking closely at the network of social ties present outside the production site.

It examines the extent to which getting ahead in an industrial communist society depends on social capital, which by existing research was shown to be the case in agrarian communist and capitalist industrial societies. Industrial technology and a Marxist ideology supposedly both impede particularism, suggesting that social capital is not that important for getting ahead. In addition, the relationship between the use of and access to social resources is explored. Retrospective data from two random samples collected in 1992 and 1993 in Leipzig and Dresden have been used to test our expectations. Although universalism seemingly dominated the attainment process, as a person's education was more important than his father's resources, nearly half of the employed got their jobs through some informal channel. Yet, the use of informal resources only led to a better job if the contact person had high occupational prestige. Part of the influence of human capital on occupational achievement should be attributed to the effect of a person's social capital, i.e. a contact person with high prestige. Access to occupations through informal ties did not imply that these ties were used. Although one reached higher occupational ranks through weak ties (acquaintances), access through strong ties (friends or relatives) was crucial for finding a contact person with high prestige. This probably reflects the high damage potential of using illegal particularistic ties under communism. Using a high prestige contact person was far more important for getting a better job than having access to higher occupations.",,,,"Volker, Beate/E-7992-2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,0001-6993,,,,,,1999,42,1,,,,,17,34,,10.1177/000169939904200102,,,,,,,WOS:000080407200002,,,,,J,"Stoloff, JA; Glanville, JL; Bienenstock, EJ",,,,"Stoloff, JA; Glanville, JL; Bienenstock, EJ",,,Women's participation in the labor force: the role of social networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Network research about employment outcomes has rarely focused on women.

We examine the effects of a woman's general network structure on her employment status, rather than focusing on the characteristics of the specific network tie that connected her to a job. Using an innovative, yet simple, measure to capture network diversity, we test network explanations of why women are in the paid labor force, controlling for background, structural, and family composition variables. In general, we find that the greater the quality and diversity of the social resources that are available through a woman's social network, the more likely she is to be working for pay. We also find evidence that suggests disadvantaged women with children must also rely on their social support networks for childcare to enter the labor market. In addition, we explore the connection between the methods successful job searchers used to find work and the overall structure of their networks through descriptive statistics.

In a society with a command economy and a Leninist party organization, personal networks are instrumental in solving two everyday problems specific to communist societies: how to acquire goods in shea supply and whom to trust. As people invest in each other with an eye to the instrumental value of future help, the demise of communism, because of a change in the instrumental value of social ties, has induced a change in personal networks. They have become more homogeneous with regard to occupation and education, since it is no longer necessary to have a heterogenous network for the exchange of scarce goods. Because of the political control during the communist era, people did not know whom to trust, except for those with whom they had intense, stable ties, strongly embedded in dense networks. They were careful in contacts with people they did not know very well. Now the density of the core of strong ties is apt to decrease, whereas the density of the non-core is apt to increase. As long as people are uncertain about what is in their best interest, they will not create new ties. Once the social situation stabilizes, the number of weak ties is apt to rise, since the risk of weak ties is gone. Our data were collected in 1992 and 1993 among a random sample in Leipzig and Dresden. In 1993, the 1992 respondents (n=189) were interviewed again together with a new sample (n=300). The results are in line with our argument: personal networks did become smaller, the density of core networks is decreasing and the occupational and educational homogeneity has increased. A comparison of the networks of our GDR citizens to those of citizens of some Western democratic countries suggests network patterns which might be typical of socialist countries.",,,,"Volker, Beate/E-7992-2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-0172,,,,,DEC,1995,31,2,,,,,87,&,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995UH55400001,,,,,J,"MEYERSON, EM",,,,"MEYERSON, EM",,,"HUMAN-CAPITAL, SOCIAL CAPITAL AND COMPENSATION - THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF SOCIAL CONTACTS TO MANAGERS INCOMES",ACTA SOCIOLOGICA,,,,,,,,,,,,In this study the additional effect of social capital over and above the contribution of human capital on the income attainment of managers is explored. A regression analysis of a 1985 sample of 111 executive team members in Swedish public firms shows that social capital is an important influencing factor of managers' incomes. The results also show that firm size increases managers' income levels.

In the model, society is composed of many small (two-person) groups. Unemployed individuals find jobs through strong ties (intragroup social interaction), weak ties (random intergroup interaction), and formal channels. Holding constant the total level of social interaction, the author examines how a change in the composition of social interaction affects the steady-state equilibrium. An increase in weak-tie interactions reduces inequality, thereby creating a more equitable distribution of employment across groups. Moreover, an increase in weak-tie interactions increases the steady-state employment rate if inbreeding by employment status among weak ties is sufficiently low.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9602,,,,,MAR,1994,99,5,,,,,1212,1236,,10.1086/230410,,,,,,,WOS:A1994NT91600003,,,,,J,"COUCH, SR; KROLLSMITH, S",,,,"COUCH, SR; KROLLSMITH, S",,,"ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROVERSIES, INTERACTIONAL RESOURCES, AND RURAL COMMUNITIES - SITING VERSUS EXPOSURE DISPUTES",RURAL SOCIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Differences in the types of social conflict occuring in facility siting disputes and toxic contamination cases are compared. An ecological-symbolic perspective and the concept of strong and weak ties are used to interpret the nature of social conflict in two rural Pennsylvania communities and in cases in the literature. Overall, community solidarity appears likely to be enhanced in siting disputes and undermined in exposure situations. To explain this, two conflict paths are developed that move from the presence or absence of the hazard agent to individual perceptions, the generation of collective threat beliefs and the formation of strong ties, the emergence of alternative leadership and its relationship to official authorities, and finally the formation of weak ties. In each case, the type of community conflict results from the nature of the perceived environmental threat and the social process that threat sets in motion. Practical implications for rural community development are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0036-0112,,,,,SPR,1994,59,1,,,,,25,44,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994NJ11800002,,,,,J,"MONTGOMERY, JD",,,,"MONTGOMERY, JD",,,JOB SEARCH AND NETWORK COMPOSITION - IMPLICATIONS OF THE STRENGTH-OF-WEAK-TIES HYPOTHESIS,AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"Workers find jobs through personal contacts (weak and strong ties) and formal sources. Alternative formulations of the strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis suggest (1) weak ties relay job offers more frequently than strong ties, or (2) weak-tie offers are drawn from a better distribution. A formal model shows that both formulations imply a correlation between network composition and a job seeker's minimum acceptable wage. However, the use of a weak tie is never associated with higher expected wages under the first formulation, and is only sometimes associated with higher expected wages under the second formulation. These results suggest that researchers should focus on job seekers' network structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-1224,,,,,OCT,1992,57,5,,,,,586,596,,10.2307/2095914,,,,,,,WOS:A1992JW66400003,,,,,J,"MCPHERSON, JM; POPIELARZ, PA; DROBNIC, S",,,,"MCPHERSON, JM; POPIELARZ, PA; DROBNIC, S",,,SOCIAL NETWORKS AND ORGANIZATIONAL DYNAMICS,AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"In this paper we develop and test a theory of the dynamic behavior of voluntary groups. The theory combines an image of social network structure with the concept of natural selection to model changes in group composition over time. We consider the group to be a population of members subject to natural selection in sociodemographic space. According to the theory, the probability that members will enter or leave the group depends upon the number and strength of social network ties that connect group members to each other and to nonmembers. We analyze an event history dataset constructed from interviews using Life History Calendar method and information on ego-centered social networks developed from the General Social Survey Network Module. We test the hypothesis that network connections inside a group are associated with reduced membership turnover, while connections outside the group increase turnover. We find that weak ties and network connections that span greater distances in sociodemographic space are positively correlated with leaving current groups and joining new ones. We conclude that weak ties are a major source of change in group composition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-1224,,,,,APR,1992,57,2,,,,,153,170,,10.2307/2096202,,,,,,,WOS:A1992HR89200002,,,,,J,"MACY, MW",,,,"MACY, MW",,,CHAINS OF COOPERATION - THRESHOLD EFFECTS IN COLLECTIVE ACTION,AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"Granovetter's threshold model of collective action shows how each new participant triggers others until the chain reaction reaches a gap in the distribution of thresholds. Hence outcomes depend on the network of social ties that channel the chain reactions. However, structural analysis is encumbered by the assumption that thresholds derive from changing marginal returns on investments in public goods. A learning-theoretic specification imposes less stringent assumptions about the rationality of the actors and is much better suited to a structural analysis. Computer simulations suggest that threshold effects may be the key to solving the coordination problem: When individual choices are contingent on participation by others, this interdependence facilitates the coordination of contributions needed to shift the bistable system from a noncooperative equilibrium to a cooperative one. Further simulations with low-density networks show that these chain reactions require bridges that link socially distant actors, supporting Granovetter's case for the strength of weak ties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-1224,,,,,DEC,1991,56,6,,,,,730,747,,10.2307/2096252,,,,,,,WOS:A1991GW16900004,,,,,J,"MARYANSKI, AR",,,,"MARYANSKI, AR",,,AFRICAN APE SOCIAL-STRUCTURE - IS THERE STRENGTH IN WEAK TIES,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-8733,,,,,SEP,1987,9,3,,,,,191,215,,10.1016/0378-8733(87)90020-7,,,,,,,WOS:A1987M114400001,,,,,J,"FARARO, TJ",,,,"FARARO, TJ",,,BIASED NETWORKS AND THE STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-8733,,,,,,1983,5,1,,,,,1,11,,10.1016/0378-8733(83)90013-8,,,,,,,WOS:A1983RH74200001,,,,,J,"MCPHERSON, JM; SMITHLOVIN, L",,,,"MCPHERSON, JM; SMITHLOVIN, L",,,WOMEN AND WEAK TIES - DIFFERENCES BY SEX IN THE SIZE OF VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9602,,,,,,1982,87,4,,,,,883,904,,10.1086/227525,,,,,,,WOS:A1982MZ79900004,,,,,J,"FRIEDKIN, NE",,,,"FRIEDKIN, NE",,,INFORMATION-FLOW THROUGH STRONG AND WEAK TIES IN INTRA-ORGANIZATIONAL SOCIAL NETWORKS,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-8733,,,,,,1982,3,4,,,,,273,285,,10.1016/0378-8733(82)90003-X,,,,,,,WOS:A1982NM27900003,,,,,J,"FRIEDKIN, N",,,,"FRIEDKIN, N",,,A TEST OF STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF GRANOVETTER STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES THEORY,SOCIAL NETWORKS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-8733,,,,,,1980,2,4,,,,,411,422,,10.1016/0378-8733(80)90006-4,,,,,,,WOS:A1980KZ30300006,,,,,J,"GANS, HJ",,,,"GANS, HJ",,,GANS ON GRANOVETTERS STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES - COMMENT,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9602,,,,,,1974,80,2,,,,,524,527,,10.1086/225811,,,,,,,WOS:A1974U569100011,,,,,J,"GRANOVETTER, M",,,,"GRANOVETTER, M",,,STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES - REPLY,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9602,1537-5390,,,,,1974,80,2,,,,,527,529,,10.1086/225812,,,,,,,WOS:A1974U569100012,,,,,J,"GANS, HJ",,,,"GANS, HJ",,,STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES - REPLY,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9602,,,,,,1974,80,2,,,,,529,530,,10.1086/225813,,,,,,,WOS:A1974U569100013,,,,,J,"GRANOVETTER, MS",,,,"GRANOVETTER, MS",,,THE STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9602,1537-5390,,,,,1973,78,6,,,,,1360,1380,,10.1086/225469,,,,,,,WOS:A1973P772600003,,,,,

In particular, using original data from the corporate R&D laboratory of a global pharmaceutical company, we evaluate how a specific structural arrangement (i.e., belonging to a clique) affects inventors' innovative productivity. Our results show that both instrumental/knowledge-sharing cliques and affective/friendship cliques correlate positively with inventors' innovative productivity. However, we also observe that when inventors straddle knowledge-sharing and friendship cliques, their innovative productivity declines. Managerial Summary Firms competing in knowledge-intensive industries rely on the productivity of their inventors to develop innovations. Within these firms, inventors' innovative productivity is influenced by the people they interact with and by the benefits and costs associated with maintaining these relationships. We find that inventors' innovative productivity is enhanced by having strong and embedded relationships with their colleagues, regardless of these relationships being based on knowledge-sharing ties or friendship ties. However, when inventors are caught in between strong knowledge-sharing ties and strong friendship ties, their innovative productivity suffers, ultimately hampering the firm's innovative capabilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0143-2095,1097-0266,,,,OCT,2019,40,10,,,,,1593,1609,,10.1002/smj.3045,,,,,,,WOS:000484536400004,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a qualitative study followed by a scenario-based experimental study. Findings The authors show that recommenders' concern about how they are viewed by recommendation recipients (i.e. their metaperception) mediates the effects of incentives on referral likelihood in both offline and online environments. However, metaperception has a stronger effect offline where recommenders show higher impression management concerns compared to online. Furthermore, tie-strength and communication environment moderate the effect of incentives on metaperception. When referrals are made to weak-ties, incentives decrease metaperception favorability offline more than online. For strong-ties, this effect is lower, and it is similar in offline and online environments. Practical implications The authors recommend managers to design both online and offline RRPs that minimize metaperception concerns; target strong ties in any communication environment as metaperception concerns are low; and target weak ties online where metaperception concerns are muted.

In more detail, the aim of the paper is to analyse how a start-up becomes embedded through its networking behaviours in a business network. To approach this phenomenon, the theoretical frame of reference is based on the industrial network approach to industrial markets separating developing, producing and using settings. The business network settings are combined with networking behaviours consisting of both strong and weak ties. Importantly, for a start-up to become embedded through networking, resources of the start-up need to be combined with resources in the three business network settings. The paper relies on a case study methodology focusing on a start-up, founded at a technical university in Sweden, and its networking behaviours. The paper concludes that networking behaviours relying on strong ties are crucial to resource combining. However, the analysis also shows the importance of networking behaviours of weak ties, acquiring information and interaction to sensing new opportunities.

It addresses two significant gaps in the literature. While prior research has advanced the understanding of how factors around tie strength, resource mobilization, and environmental characteristics relate to new product development, it has yet to offer a more holistic understanding of the interconnected structures and the interplay among these factors. Furthermore, limited insights exist about how firms could utilize resource mobilization approaches in different environmental contexts to enhance new product success. Building on resource dependence theory, this paper contributes to prior work by adopting configuration theoretical considerations and performing an empirical investigation to identify necessary and sufficient conditions for new product success. Based on data from a survey of 354 managers from manufacturing and services firms in the United Kingdom, the study conducts a configurational comparative study based on fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to examine configurations of strong-tie and weak-tie resource mobilization approaches within particular environmental contexts for new product success. The findings reveal alternative, equifinal configurations for new product success, and add to the existing body of work by connecting the notions of network ties, resource mobilization, and context dependence, as well as by developing an integrative framework to explain the interplay of remote and proximate conditions for new product success.

It investigates the impact of online referral reward programs on receivers' responses from the perspectives of social norms and market norms. We identify the moderating conditions that are expected to affect when and how a reward leads the receiver to infer social norms, thereby increasing the referral's effectiveness. In study 1, because receivers with different tie may have relationships based on market norms or social norms (Wentzel et al. in J Serv Res 17(2):119-133, 2014), we examine the effect of tie strength and reward allocation on receivers' responses in online referral reward programs. Furthermore, we extended the analysis of study 1 in two ways through the introduction of brand relationships and reward characteristics. In study 2, we introduced brand relationships to analyze the effect of tie strength and reward allocation on receivers' responses. In study 3, we studied the effects of reward type and tie strength on receivers' responses in online referral reward programs. To capture the underlying process, we also examined the participants' perceptions of social cost in three studies. Finally, we conclude by discussing the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.

However, in strong brand relationships, receivers with strong ties in No Reward conditions tend to respond to referrals more than those with strong ties in the Reward Recommender conditions, because rewarding recommenders makes social norms transfer into market norms.

We argue that 3 complementary conditions influence dyadic expertise use in teams: A focal team member is more likely to use a peer's expertise in a specific domain when the peer is perceived to have valuable expertise (opportunity), when the member is psychologically empowered (motivation), and when the member shares a strong tie with the peer (ability).

We theorize that factors such as novelty and legitimacy, appropriation, and integration impact the ability of cluster hires to generate economic value. In turn, we hypothesize that the composition of the cluster hire (degree of expertise overlap and degree of comobility) and its fit with the strategic human capital at the hiring firm are likely to influence these factors to affect firm performance. The results from an archival study of cluster hires in 112 domestic U.S. law firms lend credence to the overarching perspective put forth in this paper, and demonstrate that the performance impact of cluster hiring is contingent on its composition and fit with the existing strategic human capital at the hiring firm. Specifically, we find that while the co-mobility dimension has a negative impact on firm performance, the degree of expertise overlap is positively related to firm performance when it adds strategic human capital to an area where the hiring firm has little or no presence. Additionally, we find that expertise overlap positively impacts firm performance when the cluster hire involves low levels of co-mobility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0001-4273,1948-0989,,,,JUN,2018,61,3,,,,,919,944,,10.5465/amj.2016.0601,,,,,,,WOS:000436229500006,,,,,

We focus on a setting where consumers have multiple learning experiences using opinions from both uni- and bidirectional network ties. This allows us to investigate the impact of learning from both weak and strong ties. We find that, with sufficient experience, having more ties may lead to better decisions. However, the dynamic effects are dependent on the strength of the tie. Additional strong ties (operationalized as bidirectional links) lead to immediate positive effects on decision quality. However, additional weak ties (unidirectional, follower relationships) initially lead to lower decision quality. We find beneficial learning effects, however: adding more weak ties improves decision quality once one has sufficient experience in the community. Indeed, more-experienced consumers receive, ultimately, higher positive effects on decision quality from weak ties compared with strong ties. We interpret this as demonstrating that one needs to learn the norms of a new community before using the available information to improve decisions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0732-2399,1526-548X,,,,MAY-JUN,2018,37,3,,,,,425,444,,10.1287/mksc.2017.1076,,,,,,,WOS:000439017700005,,,,,

An attention-based view of innovation in social networks,STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"Research Summary: This study introduces the notion of attention allocation in networks to argue that individuals with different types of network structure produce good ideas via different pathways. Using survey data on communication networks at a software company, we find that people with highly constrained networks generate good ideas by following a logic of interrogation, by which they focus their attention on information from a particular contact. Conversely, individuals with less constrained networks produce good ideas by following a logic of recombination, whereby they divide their attention to information coming from across multiple contacts. The results show that in highly constrained networks, interrogation is a more reliable pathway to good ideas than recombination. We discuss the implications of these findings for behavioral strategy, social networks, and innovation. Managerial Summary: People can develop good ideas when they recombine diverse information inputs shared by non-redundant communication partners that span multiple local clusters. But, in an organization, most individuals are embedded in constrained networks of people who know each other and thus typically receive redundant information from work colleagues. This study suggests that they can innovate via a different pathway: through interrogation. We find that people who focus their attention on information coming from a particular person succeed at generating good ideas because they deeply interrogate local knowledge and develop domain-specific insights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0143-2095,1097-0266,,,,APR,2018,39,4,,,,,1188,1215,,10.1002/smj.2755,,,,,,,WOS:000427594100010,,,,,

Emerging research on exposure to diverse informational resources (e.g., ideas and knowledge), however, has painted a more complex picture regarding its effect on individuals' creative performance. This research examines the effects of culturally diverse networks on the flow of ideas and individuals' creativity. Combining social network analysis with experimental methods, two studies using different samples found that a culturally diverse network increases the likelihood of receiving culture-related novel ideas (but not other types of novel ideas) from network contacts, whether or not these contacts share one's own culture of origin. Additionally, the creativity effect of network diversity depends on the type of tasks. Networks' degree of cultural diversity increases creativity on tasks that draw on varied cultural-knowledge resources but not on other types of tasks. These findings highlight that network diversity provides access to specific forms of knowledge and has a domain-specific effect on creativity.

This research brings together the opposite ends of the tie-strength continuum: the weak ties, which are instrumental in tapping into novel ideas and emerging technologies, and the strong ties, which promote joint resource investments and capability development. By doing so, we bring salience to the existence of intermediate ties (i.e., the ties of moderate strength) and their implications for value creation. Even though the intermediate ties are likely most common in the buyer-supplier context, they have been given short shrift in the literature. We predict a U-shaped relation, where weak ties and strong ties are more effective than intermediate ties in value creation. Furthermore, we explore the moderating role of dependence asymmetry. Our hypotheses are tested using survey data from a major global automaker and its North American suppliers. The results demonstrate that both the weak and strong buyer-supplier ties lead to higher value creation, whereas intermediate ties do not increase value creation.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how aspiring entrepreneurs in a Danish rural area setting manage to get embedded into relevant business networks. Before the literature background on social capital and regional development, the authors use the embeddedness approach in explaining whether weak or strong ties are most beneficial to get the business started and how lacking strong ties can be compensated. Design/methodology/approach - This paper takes an economic sociology perspective on social capital and is empirically based on a case study. The sample consists of a group of young aspiring entrepreneurs, living in the rural area of Southern Jutland, who are all committed to an organization which supports regional start-ups. Findings - The authors found that aspiring entrepreneurs have different needs depending on their development status and type of innovation. Founders, who are developing or have developed new product innovations, seem to have an increased need for ""strong ties"" with consultants and those with knowledge about building up a professional network. Founders, who are developing or have developed a significantly improved service, have strong ties with former fellow students and researchers at the university. Originality/value - This study illustrates that aspiring entrepreneurs connected to a regional entrepreneurship center gained access to a wider relevant network. Depending on their level of embeddedness, they could build new strong relationships and exploit information stemming from new ""weak ties"" and as such harness more benefits. The study shows that less privileged start-ups can substitute strong ties, especially through the support of professional managers of startup-supporting organizations.

The purpose of this paper is to examine these two opposing psychological mechanisms to reconcile the conflicting findings. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted three experiments. Study 1 tests the base model. Studies 2 and 3 add moderators to test whether each mediating variable operates exclusively on its intended relationship. Findings Incentive size enhanced the attractiveness of an incentive, but reduced the metaperception favorability of the recommendation. These two opposing mechanisms operated in parallel, independently and fully mediated the effects of incentive size to likelihood of making a recommendation. Thus, the net impact of incentives on recommendation behavior depended on the relative strengths of these two opposing forces.

Design/methodology/approach Based on a sample of 605 respondents from China, data were analyzed by structural equation modeling. Findings The results show that although Chinese animosity toward Taiwan is moderate, it is significantly driven by ethnocentrism, which has a significant and negative effect on willingness to buy, but not on the perception of Taiwanese brand quality. The Chinese animosity toward Taiwan, however, has negative and significant effects on their perception of Taiwanese brand quality and their intention of purchasing Taiwanese brands.

The taxonomy highlights the mechanisms through which African women can overcome the obstacles faced when setting up businesses. Design/methodology/approach The paper discusses the role of weak ties networks in entrepreneurial activities and integrates the concept with the key parameters of the P-A paradigm. The aim is to develop a taxonomy (or scorecard) for mitigating the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs in Africa from a P-A perspective. Six P-A parameters are analysed, namely, attitudes towards risk; behaviour-based vs targets-based contracts; asymmetric information; risk-sharing; transaction costs; and verification and monitoring costs. Findings With the aid of the taxonomy developed in the paper, the authors analyse the channels through which SWT networks may impact in mitigating the problems arising from the P-A paradigm. Some implications for women entrepreneurs in Africa are highlighted. Research limitations/implications The current conceptual study suggests that the SWT concept can be used by African women entrepreneurs to mitigate P-A problems. The authors argue that the original P-A taxonomy developed in the paper fills a conceptual research gap in the existing literature. Embedding the SWT concept within a P-A framework will facilitate further research not only to understand African women entrepreneurs' attitudes (and responses) towards risk and uncertainty, but this will also facilitate greater understanding of the importance women attach to the role of incentives within their businesses.

We posit that the effectiveness of specific structural feature of sales intrafirm networks (i.e., the number and strength of salesperson intrafirm ties) depends on whether cross-functional collaboration occurs with marketing or customer service. These differences exist because each function has distinct goals and competencies. Using network data from salespeople working for a chemical manufacturer, we found that having few sales-marketing total ties increase salesperson performance, while having many ties with customer service results in better sales results. We also found that strong ties with marketing colleagues lead to high sales growth while sales-customer service collaboration benefits more when ties are weak. Moderating effects show that the combination of few strong ties with marketing and of many weak ties with customer service boosts salesperson performance. While we found that total ties with marketing have a U-shaped effect on salesperson performance, there is an inverted U-shaped effect for sales-customer service collaborations and thus an optimal number of ties. This study advances our understanding of cross-functional collaboration in sales intrafirm network research. From a managerial perspective, our findings suggest that salespeople benefit from network steering capabilities when managing cross-functional contacts.

The study analyzes how firms can acquire valuable knowledge from their networks, filling the gap in the literature on how this process occurs inside and outside clusters.

Using social network methodologies and theory of social learning, this study explores the outcomes of such networks and herding behavior on investors' performance. In particular, this study examines how different types of social learningdirect and indirect impact investment performance. The results show that the network structure of a user's network (indirect social learning) has an impact on performance; in particular, following people with structural holes contributes to improved investment performance. This study also analyzes two different modes of herding (direct social learning), and finds that while information-based herding leads to improved performance, reputation-based herding negatively affects performance. This study extends the theoretical implications regarding the role of different types of social learning in the investment realm. Platform providers should thus consider the various types of information provided to investors in the marketplace to facilitate social learning behavior that improves investment outcomes.

This study overcomes this view investigating how professional service organizations can enable users' knowledge search while controlling for the risks of inappropriateness. Combining a qualitative research on 5 innovation processes in healthcare organizations with quantitative research on 110 service users, our findings highlight that professional providers, such as senior clinicians, shaped their tactics according to the 'threats' of laggards, i.e. users searching knowledge outside of professional logics of appropriateness; more than to the opportunities of lead user communities. Professional providers sought to ""activate"" users' engagement with knowledge search by investing on their literacy, i.e. showing the basics of the logic of appropriateness informing their decision; and on trust relationships, i.e. becoming transparent on the criteria of knowledge selection during the innovation processes.

Empirical results from our study of 260 Chinese firms show that all three types of informal ties positively affect inbound innovation openness, whereas only business ties facilitate outbound innovation openness.

Competing hypotheses are developed for the nature of strategic networks in the discovery and creation opportunity contexts. The results from our two studies (using PSED II dataset and data collected from women entrepreneurs in India) show that entrepreneurial strategic networks differ based on whether entrepreneurs are pursuing discovery or creation opportunities, i.e., entrepreneurs operating in 'discovery' contexts tend to use networks ties with individuals who are relatively similar to themselves, while entrepreneurs in 'creation' contexts tend to use network ties with individuals who are relatively different from themselves. Further, the results also show that the diversity in strategic networks is not unidirectional in discovery and/or creation contexts but varies depending on the specific matters for which the entrepreneur seeks advice.

Building on these insights, we develop an integrative framework, defining the conditions under which each of the four processes is likely to transpire, and showing how the stock of social capital held by the scouting unit allows it to perform increasingly high value-added activities over time. Implications for the MNC, external knowledge sourcing, and boundary-spanning literatures are discussed. Managerial summary: Over the years, many multinational corporations (MNCs) have created overseas ""scouting"" units to tap into new ideas and opportunities in leading-edge markets, but with mixed outcomes.

From both the theoretical and empirical points of view, this increased attention has generated many inconsistencies. In this article we propose that a conceptualization of the idea journey encompassing phases that the literature has so far overlooked can help solve existing tensions. We conceptualize four phases of the journey of an idea, from conception to completion: idea generation, idea elaboration, idea championing, and idea implementation. We propose that a creator has distinct primary needs in each phase: cognitive flexibility, support, influence, and shared vision, respectively. Individual creators successfully move through a phase when the relational and structural elements of their networks match the distinct needs of the phase. The relational and structural elements that are beneficial for one phase, however, are detrimental for another. We propose that in order to solve this seeming contradiction and the associated paradoxes, individual creators have to change interpretations and frames throughout the different phases. This, in turn, allows them to activate different network characteristics at the appropriate moment and successfully complete the idea journey from novel concept to a tangible outcome that changes the field.",,,,"Mannucci, Pier Vittorio/Y-1748-2019","Mannucci, Pier Vittorio/0000-0002-9391-6696",,,,,,,,,,,,0363-7425,1930-3807,,,,JAN,2017,42,1,,,,,53,79,,10.5465/amr.2014.0462,,,,,,,WOS:000390618800004,,,,,

Effects of network centrality, structural holes, and knowledge tacitness",ASIAN JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION,,,,,,,,,,,,"Accessing external knowledge is an important factor in successful innovation. Knowledge search is an issue of concern for Chinese firms because many firms generally have relatively weak research and development (R&D) and innovation capabilities that cannot support innovative development through mere internal innovations. This study examines the interactive effects of network centrality, structural holes, and knowledge tacitness when formal knowledge search depth (FKSD) affects innovation performance from the perspective of formal/informal knowledge search. A survey of 161 firms in China suggests that FKSD positively affects innovation performance, and the effect is positively moderated by network centrality. Given high knowledge tacitness, FKSD is more effective in fostering innovation performance when firms' network centrality is higher. Furthermore, high knowledge tacitness results in rich structural holes negatively moderating the effect of FKSD on innovation performance, whereas low tacitness generates a positive moderating role. This indicates that Chinese firms may consider using more formal search channels to increase external knowledge search depth and to dynamically adjust the depth of such a formal search or the mode of network structural embeddedness according to the degree of knowledge tacitness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1976-1597,2158-6721,,,,,2017,25,1,,,SI,,79,97,,10.1080/19761597.2017.1302546,,,,,,,WOS:000404615200006,,,,,

In particular, the authors aim to answer the following research questions: how do dyadic and network relationships contribute to inter-organizational creation and transfer of knowledge? More specifically, which joint activities between organizations facilitate inter-organizational learning within a knowledge network? That is, the authors are interested in the relationship processes for inter-organisational learning, aiming to identify and understand the joint activities through which organizations within an institutional network generate and transfer knowledge. Design/methodology/approach - Aiming at studying how six institutional actors generate and transfer knowledge, the existing dyadic relationships between a focal actor (a technological center of the textile and clothing industry - CITEVE) and each one of the other five institutional actors were studied. In the study of this knowledge network the authors analyzed several documental sources and carried out 19 interviews. Findings - This study shows how dyadic and network relationships contribute to inter-organisational creation and transfer of knowledge. It assesses several joint activities through which organizations in the studied network learn with each other and compares the five dyadic relationships in terms of their distinctive features. Through the cooperative effort based on joint activities between actors, the studied network generates complementary and multidisciplinary knowledge aiming to promote network learning of the studied organizations. Management implications and suggestions for further research on network learning are discussed. Originality/value - This paper adds to the literature on network learning and management by empirically illustrating how a network of organizations in a given industry contributes to knowledge generation. It is an original contribution because, first, it allows a better understanding of how organizations of a knowledge network interact and contribute for network learning. In particular, the paper identifies a large number of joint activities for inter-organizational learning in the context of a traditional industry. Second, the research shows empirically how such interaction and learning occur in practice within a network context that comprises only institutional actors.",,,,"Eiriz, Vasco/F-1840-2010","Eiriz, Vasco/0000-0001-8122-7060",,,,,,,,,,,,1460-1060,1758-7115,,,,,2017,20,2,,,,,230,249,,10.1108/EJIM-11-2015-0117,,,,,,,WOS:000401005600003,,,,,

Based on the assumption that entrepreneurs learn from networks, the purpose of this paper is to examine which types of difficulties encourage entrepreneurs to use networks to facilitate learning, whether entrepreneurs change networks to deal with such difficulties, and which network characteristics facilitate learning. Design/methodology/approach - Networks are considered a potential source of learning, namely, the cognitive process of acquiring and structuring knowledge, creating meaning from experience and generating new solutions from existing knowledge. Through networks, entrepreneur share information and discuss opportunities and problems. Using an innovative approach combining story telling and network mapping, this study analyses how entrepreneurs use networks in learning. The data collected from six entrepreneurs working in knowledge-intensive sectors enables examining the learning process ensuing from the interactions between entrepreneurs and their contacts. Findings - The findings show that entrepreneurs construct different types of networks in response to their difficulties, not in relation to products or technologies, but to learn to overcome self-crises, external threats, management and organisational issues. The findings reveal that entrepreneurs develop networks dominated by strong ties for exploitative learning and networks dominated by weak ties for explorative learning.

Prior research often treats KT processes as a firm-level capability, assuming knowledge flows uniformly within a firm. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether such a view is too simplistic because it ignores potential differences between inter-group and intra-group KT processes within a firm. Design/methodology/approach - The authors surveyed 137 software development professionals in a large Japanese electronics firm regarding co-workers who acted as critical sources of useful knowledge and the factors that affected KT within and across internal organizational boundaries. Using regression analysis, the authors test the extent to which factors such as the characteristics of the knowledge, the characteristics of the tie, and the characteristics of the network differentially affect KT within internal organizational boundaries vs across them. Findings - The authors find that factors such as the accessibility of the knowledge source, network density, and collective teaching all help in transferring knowledge, while knowledge tacitness inhibit such transfers, but that the effect of these properties varies significantly depending on whether KT occurs across group boundaries. Originality/value - Existing research on KT within firms tends to treat all such transfers as uniform, with little difference between the dynamics of within-group transfer and between-group transfer.

J,"Hautz, J",,,,"Hautz, Julia",,,Opening up the strategy process - a network perspective,MANAGEMENT DECISION,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose - While strategy was traditionally perceived as exclusive, and limited to small groups within organizations, recently a shift toward greater openness through inclusion of a larger number and variety of actors is emerging. The purpose of this paper is to adopt a social network perspective to develop a theoretical framework on how this increased openness has a varying impact in the different phases of the strategy process. Design/methodology/approach - The author suggests that the strategy process is shaped through social interactions between individuals. Specifically the author conceptualizes how introducing openness affects individuals' structural and relational characteristics, which impact generating new strategic ideas (variation), and selecting (selection), and integrating them into the existing set of routines (retention). Findings - The framework shows that benefits and costs of increased openness balance differently. While substantial benefits may be realized in the idea generation phase, costs may outweigh the benefits in the selection and retention phase. Practical implications - Based on the framework, implications can be drawn on how openness should be introduced in the different phases of the strategy process. Specifically the author discusses appropriate open strategy tools based on social technologies, which organizations can use to benefit from openness in the different stages. Originality/value - Open strategy is a newly emerging phenomenon, which seems to fundamentally change the strategist's work.

The research evaluates time savings based on the strength of connection, the network distance between the seeker and provider and the provider's centrality in the network. To conduct this study, the research team analysed a data-set of 10,849 knowledge sharing dyads reported through a survey administered in one department in a large construction and engineering organization. Data were analysed using social network analysis and multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure. Results showed that stronger connections were assessed as more beneficial for time savings, especially when the connections were with central actors who had higher closeness centrality scores. Knowledge seekers also had a higher assessment of time savings when they were closer (in terms of network distance) to the knowledge provider.

Design/methodology/approach - A 2 x 2 x 2 mixed design is used. Temporal distance (near vs distant) and message concreteness (text vs picture) are between-subjects factors; sharing intentions (close friends vs general public) is a within-subjects factor. Findings - Findings indicate that consumers are more likely to share promotional messages with their strong rather than weak ties. If they perceive that purchases will occur soon, concrete promotional messages will more strongly motivate them to share the message with their friends. However, if they perceive that purchases will occur in the distant future, abstract messages are more motivating. The difference occurs because construal-level theory is more effective among strong E-WOM ties.

This paper aims to contribute to the literature interested in identifying and analyzing important antecedents of entrepreneurs' choices regarding social relations. The study shows how the venture stage, innovativeness and internationalization of the firm potentially influence entrepreneurial choices regarding their social sources of advice. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is based on cross-sectional survey data for the years 2009 and 2010, involving 13 Middle East and North African (MENA) countries. Respondents include future prospective entrepreneurs, start-ups and owner-managers of operating businesses, a total of 13,251 respondents across all countries for the entire period. Findings - Entrepreneurs with innovative ventures draw more on advice sources that are able to give information useful for the commercialization of innovative products, and entrepreneurs of internationally exposed ventures rely on a broad base of advice sources that can connect them with a foreign market. However, the outcomes regarding the impact of ""different venture stages"" point to social interaction patterns that are strongly influenced by local culture and that do not support the assumption of universal entrepreneurship behavior. This study shows that social interactions decline in quantity the more as the venture progresses in age. However, the type of social interaction (e.g. private or professional sources) that entrepreneurs engage throughout the different venture stages remains essentially the same and does not change across different entrepreneurial phases. In the MENA sample, private relations remain the most important source of advice throughout all phases, and they are not replaced by other contacts. Research limitations/implications - Limitations of this paper refer to the use of a large-scale database that cannot address certain issues without more direct observation, such as the quality of different social relations. Future research could address this issue by offering more fine-grained items for the different advice sources.

The entrepreneurs that coordinate their relations in innovation networks are faced with a continuous tension of making the independent competitive business decisions and building trust-based relations in their social and economic networks. These tensions call for an adequate integration of individual and collective perspectives in social behaviour of business organizations.

This paper integrates insights from two separate yet complementary parts of research. In the first part, we discuss the main patterns of entrepreneurial decision making, based on S. Sarasvathy's theory of effectuation, and present the findings of empirical research on entrepreneurial decision making in complex business environments (survey of expert entrepreneurs in USA and Lithuania). The survey has shown that even though respondents operate in environments of similar uncertainty, their entrepreneurial predispositions are quite different. Despite these differences, they regard partnerships and networks as the single most important instrument for managing the environmental risk and uncertainty. In the second part, we present the theoretical insights and 3-stage model of trust emergence in entrepreneurial networks and findings of empirical research that covered 109 network facilitators from 37 countries from Europe and Americas. The development of trust in network of organizations contains at least three different stages that are characterised by different level / type of trust, and respective risks calling for the managerial intervention for promoting trust on the network level. The survey has revealed the personal factors as being of key importance throughout the process of inter-organizational trust development, while social and institutional factors becoming important in the later stages of the process.

Two subprocesses of organizational learning, information acquisition and distribution, were measured using social network analysis in a decade-old consultancy firm in India. Results reveal who shares information with whom, who goes to whom for information, who is bypassed, who hoards, how groups interact, and how much information is shared at the organizational level.

Relevant knowledge and resources can often be found outside an entrepreneur's immediate competencies and expertise. For this reason, entrepreneurs use social relations to get access to these resources. This paper analyzes the role of such social relations when it comes to entrepreneurial performance; it also explores how entrepreneurial choices regarding social networks depend on the quality of the institutions for whom they work. Low-quality institutions create environmental uncertainties that have significant effects on an entrepreneur's strategic choices and the usage and usefulness of their social networks. This paper uses cross-sectional survey data from entrepreneurial firms in the Middle East and North Africa to show that institutional context directly influences various characteristics of entrepreneurial network choices and that it also affects the relevance of strong and weak ties with significant impact on entrepreneurial performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1321-5906,1175-0979,,,,AUG,2016,23,2,,,,,151,171,,10.1080/13215906.2016.1221361,,,,,,,WOS:000387143700004,,,,,

Drawing on organizational learning theory and analyzing survey data obtained from 392 department heads and project leaders of new product development teams, we demonstrate that cross-functional coopetition has a significant positive effect on exploratory innovation. Moreover, we find support for the moderating influence of social cohesion on the relationship between coopetition and exploitative innovation.

In an attempt to address this, this research examines the simultaneous influence of individual and regional social capital on the discovery and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities using individual-level data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor linked with regional-level data on social capital. The results show that individuals from regions with higher social capital are more likely to discover and to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities.

Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on semi-structured interviews with rural innovative entrepreneurs and regional key informants. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to identify configuration of relationships, and content analysis to understand the nature of the knowledge relationships. Findings - Higher innovation levels are related to proactive and strong relationships with extra-local actors, usually from the international level, mainly from the Baltic Sea region. The actors, who have a greater role in innovation, are special customers, scientific organisations and non-human actors (e.g. trade fairs). Greater variety in proactive relationships helps achieve higher-level innovations. Reactive and weaker relationships tend to be related to lower innovation levels. Originality/value - This study contributes to the development of rural innovation research practice through the development of a framework for analysing the configuration of knowledge networks and the nature (activity and strength) of relations between actors. Thus, two different dimensions not used together previously are combined and advanced.

The purpose of this study is to examine how a firm can manage and govern supply ties to access new knowledge, from the perspective of social network. We examine the role of interorganizational interactions and network structure in enhancing knowledge flow in inbound open innovation with suppliers. Design/methodology/approach - First, A systematic literature review methodology was adopted. The research design, given that the study of open innovation is still at a nascent stage, consists of an exploratory case study to provide an in- depth analysis. We adopt semi- structured interviews to examine the role of social network in knowledge flow in supply network. Findings - The findings of this paper add to the understanding of the role of inter- organizational interaction and network structure in enhancing knowledge transfer in open innovation practices. We propose that the implementation of open innovation with suppliers requires specific supply networks based on the interactions between buyer and suppliers. Building from the SLR, we extend the idea of tie strength by Granovetter (1973), and introduce two forms of strong ties; "" vital strong ties"" and "" overembedded strong ties"", and two forms of weak ties; "" potential weak ties"" and "" infant weak ties"". We propose how overembeddedness and future interaction influence governance modes. Research limitations/implications - Although the main contribution of this paper is in extending the body of literature in open innovation research by looking at social network theories, the current propositions have to be validated by empirical analysis. A qualitative case study is currently in progress. Therefore, we cannot go forward until the results of this case study allow a general contribution to be made and increase the validity of results. Practical implications - First, the paper suggests how social network theory can enhance inflow of knowledge from suppliers in open innovation projects. Second, we extend inter- organizational relationships by adding vital strong and potential weak ties. This classification allows us to examine effective governance modes even at the early stage of innovation. We propose that the expectation of future business with weak ties constrains opportunistic behavior of suppliers and affects knowledge flow positively in open innovation. As for potential strong ties, they should not be excluded from open innovation projects since they can provide valuable knowledge to speed up the innovation process. Our argument also encourages practitioners to actively and dynamically make and maintain networks with suppliers in order to gain access to new knowledge. Originality/value - This study marks one of the first attempts to explain the role of structural and relational dimensions of social network in different inbound open innovation approaches with suppliers. Additionally, this study is also the first to extend the literature on strong and weak ties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-910810-87-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,325,334,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391680700039,,,,,

It is therefore imperative to understand how different contexts enable entrepreneurs to create opportunities. In this paper, we focus on the spatial context of rural entrepreneurs and explore how the rural context impacts on their opportunity creation. Based on a multiple case study, we find that rural entrepreneurs mix what we refer to as placial embeddedness - an intimate knowledge of and concern for the place - with strategically built non-local networks, i.e. the best of two worlds. Notably, the entrepreneurs seek to exhaust the localized resource base before seeking out non-local resources. Our findings thus contribute to our understanding of entrepreneurship in context and challenge future research to explore how different forms of contexts are bridged in different settings to create varieties of entrepreneurial activities.",,,,,"Korsgaard, Steffen/0000-0001-7396-0975",,,,,,,,,,,,0898-5626,1464-5114,,,,20-Oct,2015,27,10-Sep,,,,,574,598,,10.1080/08985626.2015.1085100,,,,,,,WOS:000367806800003,,,,,
J,"Karayanni, DA",,,,"Karayanni, Despina A.",,,"A Model of Interorganizational Networking Antecedents, Consequences and Business Performance",JOURNAL OF BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKETING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose: This quantitative study intended to examine the communication interactions that develop within a business network among various actors (i.e., customers, providers, cooperators, etc.), together with their effects upon business networking and performance. To these ends, we developed a conceptual model of dyadic marketing-oriented and network-oriented communication exchanges (i.e., interorganizational antecedents), interorganizational networking consequences, and business performance. Specifically, interorganizational networking consequences were examined in terms of tactical and strategic cooperation, whereas business performance was examined in terms of adaptability, productivity and efficiency.Methodology/approach: To set the hypotheses of the study we delved into the wide stream of marketing literature pertaining to interorganizational networks and business-to-business relationships, and specifically to the marketing orientation theory, the social network theory, and the IMP approach. These research hypotheses were tested using advanced statistical analysis and causal modeling. The research sample comprised 1,000 business-to-business international companies, which were mostly U.S., and European and were randomly selected from the yahoo.com business-to-business companies' subdirectory. The data collection involved a two-wave e-mail survey, in which the quantitative research instrument was emailed to the respective marketing directors' personal accounts. Totally 249 high ranking marketing executives responded, thus yielding a 24.9% response rate. The selected data were, then, subjected to rigorous advanced statistical analysis of structural equation modeling, using the AMOS21 statistical package, to test reliability and stability of selected measures and validity of the research model, as a whole.Findings: Overall, the research findings provided sufficient evidence that the proposed model was robust. Moreover, the findings supported that communication exchanges that deploy within a wide array of participants (i.e., within a network of organizational members, customers, partners, and other interacting partners within a market), may have stronger explanatory powers upon a company's networking effects and business performance, than communication exchanges that evolve merely at a dyadic company-customer level.Originality/value/contribution: This research is original; that is, it deals with empirical, quantitative data and makes an attempt to combine marketing concepts mainly from 3 marketing streams studying the long-term business-to-business relationships. Our approach is based on existing marketing literature, suggesting that networks, apart from being embedded in previous relationships and interactions, they may also be based on more loosely coupling between organizations. Thus, we use the IMP approach to formulate the measures of our study; however, we don't discriminate between strong and weak ties in relationship bonding. In this research we focus on specific communication behaviors that may nurture interorganizational networking and look for effects upon cooperation and business performance. The research findings imply that marketing executives would worthwhile expand their communication exchanges beyond their narrow customers', or providers' network, to the wider array of trustworthy business circle, as such a behavior may largely favor their companies' adaptability to environmental changes, flourish innovation, and lead to synergies in efficiency and productivity gains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-712X,1547-0628,,,,2-Oct,2015,22,4,,,,,293,312,,10.1080/1051712X.2015.1115702,,,,,,,WOS:000366746200003,,,,,

Interestingly, resource needs rapidly change during early venture development, which may necessitate a change in entrepreneurs' networks. This study examines how the size of an early-stage entrepreneur's network affects the subsequent structural (e.g., size) and content (e.g., knowledge diversity) character of their network. Additionally, how the strength of an early-stage entrepreneur's network ties affects the subsequent structural (e.g., size and tie strength) and content (e.g., knowledge diversity) character of their network is explored. Data from the PSED-I were used to analyze the relationships. Results suggest the relationship between network size at time one and network size at time two is positive. Results further suggest a negative relationship between the number of weak ties at time one and the number of strong ties at time two.

Viewing online knowledge sharing as a matching process between knowledge providers and problems, we examine attention allocation in the context of an online community within which knowledge providers respond to problems posted by other organization members. We argue that knowledge providers are more likely to allocate attention to solving problems that more closely match their expertise, but that decisions to allocate attention are also influenced by problem characteristics such as length, breadth, and novelty, as well as by problem crowding. Analyzing 1,251 realized matches and 12,510 nonrealized matches among knowledge providers and problems posted over a 32-month period on an online discussion forum within a global engineering firm, we find evidence to support our claim that attention allocation is driven by the features of a particular provider-problem match, thereby shifting the discourse from knowledge provider-seeker relationships to knowledge provider-problem matches.

Findings show that not only do host-and home-country embeddedness increase knowledge transfer success, but they also interact positively. At the organizational level, however, the presence of other returnees in a home-country workplace decreases the positive effect of a returnee's host-country embeddedness, whereas the similarity of a returnee's industry background to the home-country industry increases it. At the country level, high xenophobia in a given home country diminishes the positive effect of host-country embeddedness but increases the positive effect of home-country embeddedness.

SNSs have grown in both popularity and use. They allow individuals to articulate their social networks by developing a list of other members on the site with whom they share a connection. These platforms also allow companies to create profiles to promote their brands. However, many firms have jumped into SNSs by creating a ""brand page"" without fully understanding how to spread it successfully. Design/methodology/approach - Two experiments were developed. In the first one, the authors manipulated how the individual comes to know about brand pages. Participants discovered a brand page through a friend with whom they have either a strong tie or a weak tie. In the second experiment (2 x 2), the authors manipulated tie strength (strong vs weak) and the type of recommendation (active vs passive). Findings - Results of the first study show that as the individual has more experience in Facebook (measured in this paper through satisfaction, past behavior of following brands and Facebook intensity), the effect of tie strength on the intention to join a brand page dilutes. The second study confirms Study 1 and shows that strong ties exert more influence than weak ties when the brand page is actively recommended by Facebook friends. Practical implications - This paper shows that the influence of strong ties is particularly important for individuals with low levels of experience in Facebook. As experience in SNSs is expected to continue growing, managers should not forget the role of weak ties as a source of information for their networked friends. Strong ties only remain more influential than weak ties when the information about the brand page is received through an invitation. Originality/value - This paper explores the interpersonal influences in Facebook, asserting that the influence of tie strength depends on the level of experience in the SNS, and on the way, information about the brand page is received.",,,,"SICILIA, MARIA/R-4667-2019","SICILIA, MARIA/0000-0002-1731-4570",,,,,,,,,,,,1061-0421,2054-1643,,,,,2015,24,6,,,,,580,595,,10.1108/JPBM-08-2014-0696,,,,,,,WOS:000371051200003,,,,,

The research presented here examines nine case studies of Canadian NHP firms and reveals that they utilised all network-related internationalisation processes simultaneously to internationalise including Johanson and Mattsson's (1988, 1994) network theory, Johanson and Vahlne's (2003) updated the Uppsala Model and the resource-based perspective on network theory (Ruzzier et al., 2006). They networked with and extensively utilised third parties, including government bodies, trade associations, government advisors, consultants and other domestic networks with international ties, in Canada and internationally to gain technical, market and internationalisation knowledge, and direct and indirect experiential knowledge which contributed to the internationalisation process confirming the study by Fletcher and Harris (2012). In a departure from the literature, this study found that weak ties (Granovetter, 1973) developed with third parties who were new to the networks allowed the NHP firms to develop competitive advantages necessary for them to overcome the liability of outsidership in entering new international markets. The type of technical, market and internationalisation knowledge gained, its content and the direct and indirect sources of knowledge from third parties were all shown to contribute to the internationalisation process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1876-0228,,978-1-78560-032-6; 978-1-78560-033-3,,,,2015,11,,,,,,29,53,,,,,,,,,WOS:000358646500003,,,,,

It focuses on a strategic alliance's first new product development (NPD) project, which is characterized by a lack of prior experience and insufficient trust between partners and explores how the interaction between (1) interorganizational learning (the degree [amount of knowledge shared] and type [tacit or explicit nature of the knowledge]); (2) the required communication (frequency level and degree of media-richness) to transfer and exchange knowledge; and (3) economic transaction considerations (reducing cost and avoiding opportunism), in highly uncertain and dynamic environments, and, in the absence of an assumption of trust, will determine the future strength of the ties between partners. We argue that the degree and type of interorganizational learning that are required to efficiently develop an alliance's first NPD project determine the strength of the ties between the partners. Each degree and type of learning has a different impact on the frequency and media richness of the partners' communication, and consequently each leads to a different level of social tie strength between the partners. This relationship is moderated by the partners' market overlap. We suggest that the required degree and type of interorganizational learning is contingent on the project characteristics (degree of innovation; radical versus incremental, and the mode of development; modular versus integrated). This relationship, however, is moderated by the partners' technical skills (complementary versus similar).",,,,"Badir, Yuosre F./G-7717-2013","Badir, Yuosre F./0000-0001-6267-2257",,,,,,,,,,,,0737-6782,1540-5885,,,,JAN,2015,32,1,,,,,154,169,,10.1111/jpim.12222,,,,,,,WOS:000345756000012,,,,,

This study explores the role of social ties in venture creation by REs. Based on twenty case studies in India, the findings show that (1) local ties are indispensable for venture creation, and (2) the heterogeneity in the way REs leverage social ties across the host and home countries is contingent on the location of their intention to start up and generation of idea for their venture.

We advance this perspective by exploring the extent to which individual actions are needed to mobilize information and influence accessed through social networks, and whether such information and influence would mutually reinforce to enhance managerial innovativeness.

In three studies, we analyze the influence of social sharing of consumption-related emotions on the sharer's satisfaction with the consumption experience and related outcomes. Study 1 demonstrates that the sharing of negative emotions amplifies the sharer's dissatisfaction. Study 2 shows that the specific nature of the negative emotion (anger vs. regret) and that of the recipient (friend vs. stranger) moderate this negative effect. Study 3 finds that the effects of sharing further depend on whether the recipient is viewed as a prospective customer or not. From a theoretical perspective, the findings contradict the claim that cathartic venting contributes to a person's relief and well-being. In addition, the assertion that strong ties are better than weak ties does not always hold. The benefits of sharing depend on the specific emotion involved and the recipient's interests. From a managerial perspective, the findings should help companies devise programs to compensate the negative consequences of service failures. For example, by offering customers the opportunity to express anger to strangers through their corporate websites or social media communities, managers may be able to reduce customer dissatisfaction and thus maintain the relationship. In addition, such opportunities may help the firm identify dissatisfied consumers and, in turn, apply service recovery strategies to retain them.",,,,"de Maya, Salvador Ruiz/D-4840-2009","de Maya, Salvador Ruiz/0000-0001-7487-8308",,,,,,,,,,,,1094-6705,1552-7379,,,,NOV,2014,17,4,,,,,475,488,,10.1177/1094670514538835,,,,,,,WOS:000343836200008,,,,,

The exact overlap between formal as well as informal contacts between individuals, forming multiplex or what we call rich ties because of their contribution, especially drives the transfer of new, innovative knowledge in a firm. Studying two cases in very different settings suggests these rich ties have a particularly strong effect on knowledge transfer in an organization, even when controlling for the strength of ties.

Organizational networking refers to firm behaviors, i.e. the activities/routines/practices, which enable an organization to make sense of and capitalize on their networks of direct and indirect business relationships. We conceptualize the measurement model as a second-order formative construct with four first-order reflective constructs based on a four-dimensional view of organizational networking comprising information acquisition, opportunity enabling, strong-tie resource mobilization and weak-tie resource mobilization. The scale validation was undertaken at the first- and second-order levels. The result confirms the four distinct first-order measurement models. At the second-order level, a MIMIC (multiple indicators and multiple causes) model was employed to assess the validity of the formative measurement model. The results suggest that all four components significantly contribute to the overarching construct of organizational networking, with strong-tie resource mobilization being the most important contributor. Thus, our operationalization confirms the uniqueness of the different dimensions of organizational networking that should be configured as a strategy of sensing and seizing opportunities in the network. The organizational networking scale will provide future research with a basis to explore different strategic patterns of networking behaviors in varying contexts, and its role in relation to other organizational behaviors and outcome variables, such as firm performance.

Results are consistent with the resource dependency approach, indicating an adverse effect of capital constraints on firm performance: firms suffering capital constraints perform substantially better, suggesting that they need more capital simply to finance newly recognized profit opportunities. Human capital plays a vital role in relaxing capital constraints and improves the entrepreneurial performance, whereas the effect of social capital stemming from strong ties and weak ties is limited: strong ties bring emotional support and weak ties give nonfinancial benefits from regular and useful business contacts.

Three dimensions of social capital are applied in a case study of a regional strategic network - the socio-economic, the structural and the actor-oriented dimensions - while focusing on the last one. Data were collected at two points in time, at the start of the regional strategic network in 2004 and at the end of the project in 2010.

Using a teacher-student lens, this study examines the combined impact of specific structural mechanisms and motivational processes by MNC parents on the ability of 216 subsidiaries to absorb parent-initiated marketing strategies. The findings reveal that MNC parents can indeed cultivate subsidiaries' ability to appropriate marketing knowledge through a combination of adopting specific social structures and investing in particular efforts. However, the effect of social structure on subsidiary absorptive capacity is indirect, and accounted for by the parents' intensity of effort. A number of theoretical implications emerge from the findings for research on absorptive capacity in relation to the role of the knowledge source, the need to examine organizational influences in relation to one another, and validating the original absorptive capacity dimensions.

In this context, knowledge and knowledge transfer are considered an important source of innovation and competitive advantage. Social capital theory offers a theoretical approach to explain how individuals, groups, and organizations manage relationships and access knowledge resources. The structural dimension of social capital has stimulated debate regarding optimal network configuration to achieve innovation. The extant literature suggests network structures evolve from a bridging configuration to a bonding configuration without examining the details of how the evolution occurs within the network and its stage-by-stage impact on knowledge transfer. This study explores this relationship by analyzing the evolution of a successful Irish pharmaceutical network involving organizations from industry and academia. This research setting encompasses a rare network configuration in an industry known for its lack of collaboration among competing firms., Findings show that structural holes provide access to a set of complementary and heterogeneous knowledge. However, for such knowledge to be exploited, the network configuration has to evolve from a sparse network (small in size and characterized by weak ties across multiple organizational networks), to a large and cohesive network configuration characterized by high levels of commitment, trust, fine-grained information exchange, and joint problem solving. Mechanisms crucial to this evolution include consistently-scheduled meetings, training to communicate tacit knowledge, wide diffusion of knowledge through an on online portal, and relationship specific investments designed to safeguard intellectual property. Surprisingly, industry members appear to transition to a cohesive network faster than do academic members. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This idea builds upon the observation that creative ideas are ""often the result of the assemblage of different perspectives and approaches people are exposed to via social interactions."" (Baer, 2010, p 592) When the suspicions and doubts inherent in these different perspectives are prematurely pruned, known facts and low-risk understanding replace innovation and breakthrough KM activity. This is a problem that plagues Japan today. An aversion to interactions with people outside of a small in-group impedes knowledge sharing in Japan, and now manifests itself through ""KM anxieties"" as an obstacle to innovation, economic competitiveness, and understanding of the outside world. KM anxieties are not unique to the Japanese, but they are perhaps more prevalent due to Japanese reluctance to establish or explore what Granovetter (1973) called ""weak ties."" This situation largely exists due to confidence issues involved in dealing with strangers and unverified knowledge, and could be rectified if software agents were used to establish acceptable trust situations with previously unknown actors and information. With these ideas in mind, this paper considers three main themes. The first theme, addressed in section two of this paper, explores the importance of weak ties for knowledge sharing. In section three we examine the reasons for the pervasive condition of limited trust situations in Japanese society. We then probe the need and role for software agents in mitigating the trust problem in section four. It is expected that these discussions will contribute to the extant literature on and our understanding of the importance of weak ties in KM, the future role of software agents in facilitating communications and interaction between strangers, and the means by which Japan may once again engage the world in KM activities and regain its innovative edge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2048-8963,,978-1-910309-35-3,,,,2014,,,,,,,868,873,,,,,,,,,WOS:000351503500104,,,,,

More companies in recent years have reduced their advertising expenditures on traditional media. Instead, they focus more on word-of-mouth marketing to reach their potential customers. Design/methodology/approach - A2 (high/low utilitarian message context) x 2 (high/low hedonic message context) x 2 (message source: strong/weak tie strength) x 2 (channel: e-mail/blog) between-subjects experiment was conducted. A total of 363 completed questionnaires were collected in Taiwan. Findings - The findings are fourfold. First, the greater the tie strength between the sender and the receiver, the more actively they share information. Second, an audience is more willing to share a message with others when the message contains higher degrees of utilitarian or hedonic values. Third, those who are highly involved with the products are more willing to share information than those who are less involved. Fourth, those who access the information via blogs are more willing to share information with others. Research limitations/implications - The first limitation pertains to the issue of external validity. Also, to maximize internal validity, hypothetical scenarios and experimental designs were used rather than actual e-mail/blog experiences as stimuli. The results of this study provide some key strategic implications for companies that are seeking to enhance a successful viral marketing campaign.

Interpartner trust develops through the mechanisms of trust transfer and trust conversion, and managing both is an important management issue. The research question to be answered in this chapter is, How to manage trust-building processes and methods in public-private strategic alliances? The five processes of connection, communication, direction, temporary groups, and resource-sharing are found to build trust in interpartner contexts. Moreover, the processes of connection, communication, and temporary groups are found to contribute to the mechanism of trust transfer, while the process of direction appears to contribute to the mechanism of trust conversion. Although the process of resource-sharing is found to contribute mostly to the mechanism of trust transfer, when the managers get their employees to share resources with their alliance partners, this process may also contribute to trust conversion. Moreover, managing these processes consciously constitutes top-down processes that contribute to trust conversion. This chapter discusses in depth these five trust-building processes both theoretically and practically, and develops an outline of how the processes might be managed in practice. Furthermore, several methods or tools that entail one or more of the trust-building processes are presented; and four cases from public private settings further illustrate how the processes and methods can be used, or not used, in practice. The findings show that applying and managing the trust-building processes and methods has a positive influence on trust-building in public private alliances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-62396-487-0; 978-1-62396-488-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,127,150,,,,,,,,,WOS:000335808300004,,,,,

This trend, however, has left a disconnect between the literatures on formal organization and informal social structure such that crucial questions and problems at the intersection of the two streams of research have been neglected. In this essay, we make the case for rediscovering the inherent interplay between formal organization and informal social structure given their common basis of interactions in organizations. We argue that by bridging the gap between formal organization and informal social structure scholarship we can advance our understanding of both the origins and evolution of social networks and the design and effective functioning of organizations. As a first step towards achieving greater integration of research on formal organization and informal social structure we: consolidate existing scholarly understanding in this area, profile the few studies that have begun to bridge the disconnect between formal and informal elements, identify conceptual logics for linking formal and informal elements, and propose an agenda for future research.",,,,,"TORTORIELLO, Marco/0000-0001-6486-5255",,,,,,,,,,,,1941-6520,1941-6067,,,,,2014,8,1,,,,,299,345,,10.1080/19416520.2014.885252,,,,,,,WOS:000342288900006,,,,,

To resolve seemingly conflicting results, we conducted a meta-analysis of the link between entrepreneurs' personal networks and small firm performance and identify new moderators affecting this relationship. Analyses of 61 independent samples indicated that the social capital-performance link was positive and significant (r(c)=.211). Effect sizes of weak ties were smaller than those of structural holes, while network diversity had the largest positive effect on performance. Results also showed that the social capital-performance link depends on the age of small firms, the industry and institutional contexts in which they operate, and on the specific network or performance measures used. Based on these findings, we develop recommendations for future research on the contingent value of social capital for small firms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Extant research has paid extremely attention to the effect of both geographic cluster and industrial network on firms' performance; however, little studies have delineated the relationship between geographic cluster, industrial network, and competitive advantage. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that firms within the same cluster that have established idiosyncratic network resources have stronger competitive advantages than firms that have not. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical study of two prominent geographic clusters from Taiwan is analyzed by structural equation modeling. Findings - The results indicate that the degree of networking does play a mediating role between geographic cluster and competitive advantage, which may help resolve the conflicting results obtained by researchers on the influence of clusters on competitive advantage. The results also find that both degree of networking and betweenness position are conducive to the pursuit of competitive advantage. Practical implications - The research shows that firms merely locate themselves in the right cluster does not guarantee they can outperform their rivals. Rather, developing of network relationship with other firms proximate to the same cluster will strengthen a firm's competitive advantages. Originality/value - In the theoretical perspective, this paper attempts to fill the gap in the links between clusters, networks, and competitive advantage by providing that the networking as a mechanism for firms in a cluster to improve their competitive advantage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-1747,1758-6070,,,,,2014,52,5,,,,,852,871,,10.1108/MD-08-2013-0426,,,,,,,WOS:000340765500003,,,,,

Elaborating on this argument, we contend that there exist two distinct types of recombinant capabilities. First, firms may innovate through recombinant creation, i.e., by creating technological combinations new to the firm. Second, they may innovate through recombinant reuse; i.e., by reconfiguring combinations already known to the firm. We study what drives each type of capability by examining two factors: the degree of integration of a firm's intraorganizational network and the diversity of its knowledge base. We test our theoretical predictions using data on 126 semiconductor firms between 1984 and 2003. Our analyses indicate that factors that favor recombinant creation generally hinder recombinant reuse and vice versa; however, combining an integrated collaboration network and a diverse knowledge base may concurrently enhance both recombinant capabilities.

However, some have critiqued the public sphere on grounds of equal access and portrayed civil society as a guise for first-world imperialism. These critiques have implications for the role of public relations in the public sphere and civil society. This article suggests the normative role of public relations in democracy is best perceived as creating the social capital that facilitates access to spheres of public discussion and in maintaining relationships among those organizations that check state power. To that end, the paper argues that social capital does much to advance public relations theory and prescribe the role of public relations in democracy. Several implications for public relations from a social capital perspective are offered, including the creation of generalized societal trust, the building of cross-cutting or ""weak"" ties, the engagement of media on behalf of subaltern counterpublics, and the (re)creation of community or a fully functioning society.

This research effort contributes to a growing stream of research in social network theory suggesting that the contradictory theories of the strength of weak ties and weak network structures on the one hand and the theory of strong ties and closed network structures on the other have a mutually reinforcing effect on innovation outcomes if combined rather than considered separately. An in-depth exploratory single case study approach within an innovatively organized national R&D collaboration allowed giving further evidence for such a superior innovation performance and for this research to contribute to theory by demonstrating why and how such a combination may lead to higher innovation output and how this effect can be actively reinforced. It is suggested that the combination of strong and weak ties should occur at the individual rather than at the project or firm level. The authors distinguish between the additive effects of the respective innovation benefits of strong and weak ties, a positive interaction effect in the portfolio of dyadic ties of an individual and a second multilevel interaction effect of weak ties embedded in the ambidextrous network structure. Referring to previous empirical findings, intellectual property regulation and structural interdependency between network members showed a higher impact than trust with regard to leveraging weak ties and are important sources for achieving the multilevel interaction effect. Managerial implications of this research are that a large network will outperform several smaller, independent networks given that the right structure and processes are in place.

To address this challenge, we discuss the notion of 'higher-level intermediary' as a managerial role that provides coordination across functional and geographical boundaries by making knowledge sources available, connecting the parties to the transfer, and generating opportunities for knowledge exchange.

Rather, overseas knowledge is preferable when novel and accessible: that is, when new-to-the-industry knowledge is needed, when there is already a strong tie, and when the knowledge does not involve a long discussion. Conversely, local knowledge is preferable when new-to-the-industry knowledge is not needed, when the interpersonal tie is a weak tie, and when a longer discussion is warranted.

Studying three cases of solution providers which involve external service partners for solution delivery, we find that solution customer centricity - the degree to which the focal firm focuses on solution customers in the joint delivery of solutions - moderates the relationship between partner networks and open business model performance. For open business models with low solution customer centricity, a network configuration characterized by many weak ties to service partners leads to superior performance. Conversely, for open business models with high solution customer centricity, few but strong ties to partners lead to superior performance. Based on these findings, three ideal configurations of networks for open business models are derived: the controlled, the Joint, and the supported model. The findings of this paper are especially relevant for managers of product-focused firms who seek guidance in evolving their business models into solution providers.

A university spinoff, a type of entrepreneurial firm, also lacks internal capital such as financial capital and human capital.

We focus on nonredundancy in their networks and on the influence of the strength of ties to nonredundant contacts in both business and private aspects.

We highlight six factors: shared organizational foci, shared traits and interests, tie advantages from popularity, tie reinforcement from third parties, tie strength and multiplexity, and the instrumental returns from the products of ties. Findings suggest that ties form when unfamiliar people identify desirable and matching traits in potential partners. By contrast, ties persist when familiar people reflect on the quality of their relationship and shared experiences. The former calls for shallow, short-term strategies for assessing a broad array of potential ties; the latter calls for long-term strategies and substantive assessments of a relationship's worth so as to draw extended rewards from the association.

The emergence of public social software platforms (SSP), such as the online social network Facebook, is now enabling airport organizations to enter into a dialogue with the passenger and gain a deeper understanding of passenger needs while leveraging social capital. The research paper examines, if airports are able to increase their operational efficiency when entering into a collaborative communication with their customers on SSP. Design/methodology/approach. Based on a social capital / network approach to organizational work, the paper discusses the convergence of social and technological networks and the underlying motives of customers and organizations for joining social software platforms. Findings. The paper proposes a theoretical model to describe how a mutually beneficial relationship between organizations and customers on Facebook can help airports to reach economic goals. As a next step, the theoretical model will be operationalized and empirically tested in 2012 using qualitative and quantitative research. Originality/value. Social capital research as well as the adoption of SSP by organizations is still mainly scoped within organizational boundaries. The paper broadens the research focus to the focal actors organization and customer. From a practitioners' point of view, airport managers might find it useful to learn what organizational challenges arise when engaging with customers on social software platforms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-9984-45-715-4,,,,2013,,,,,,,614,622,,,,,,,,,WOS:000343755100058,,,,,

We hold that the phenomenon of managerial entrenchment should be observed through social capital theory lens, looking into the type and nature of the relationship between the manager and the entity holding corporate. We identified mechanisms that influence the creation and mobilization of managers' social capital with regard to the specific context of the Croatian transition economy and the large stake of state-owned companies present in the Croatian business sector. The primary cause why managers dominantly entrench themselves through their social ties is the fact that Croatian economy is characterized with concentrated ownership and, thus, they have an easier time to create relationships with the shareholders. Secondly, because of the strong bond between the manager and the owner(s), managers strongly identify themselves with the company. We argue that, in the context of Croatian economy, managers don't necessarily work towards entrenching themselves as a strategic and conscious entrenchment act.

As knowledge becomes more and more specialized, intensive communication between researchers from various disciplines is required. Communication is a key factor for process coordination and organisational creativity. Although new channels of communication are now available, personal face-to-face meetings remain essential. Physical movement during work has been neglected in research and management: Physical movement not only influences cognitive performance, learning ability and individual creativity, it also affects the attitude to a task, work habits and the mood. It is a communication medium in and of itself. Triggered by the environment, it affects the characteristics of chance encounters, which in turn influences communication. This study is based on a single-case case study of a research team (n=27) of a multinational pharmaceutical company. It examines the communication patterns and the physical movement behaviour during communication of natural scientists before and after moving from a traditional cell space research and work environment into a modern multi-space building. This radically new work environment offers a wide range of open and closed workspaces as well as individual and communal work areas. The findings show that in an open multi-space work environment, the conversation lengths are immediately adjusted to the new environment, whereas the movement behaviour during conversation is adapted only after some time. Sitting during conversations has increased regarding the number of events whereas physical movement during conversations has decreased. In the multi-space work environment the lengths of communication events - distinguished by different behavioural patterns during communication - are timewise shorter than before the move. The duration of conversation while sitting has declined, it is now less than half as long as before the move. Previously they were by far the longest conversations. The impact on R&D productivity seems to be mixed. Negative aspects may be overcome by managing overarching events and concentration of specific equipment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-909507-05-0,,,,2013,,,,,,,26,36,,,,,,,,,WOS:000321491800004,,,,,

During the mentoring periods accelerator management is actively involved with the portfolio firms and provides extensive networking support. The 2012 publication U.S. Seed Accelerator Rankings identified 71 U.S. accelerators and noted that their numbers are growing rapidly. In the U.S. alone it is estimated that more than 1,400 start-up companies are mentored annually by such firms. Accelerators are also growing rapidly and have become critical nodes in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Understanding relative accelerator performance and the characteristics driving superior performance can have a multiplier effect on overall start-up success. To that end, we consider two research questions in this paper: Do top-ranked accelerator portfolio firms display similar survival rates? And, what accelerator characteristics correlate with variations in portfolio firm survival? Network theory informs the hypotheses investigated in this study. In this study we compare the survival performance of accelerator portfolio firms in Silicon Valley and Ireland to those of other leading geographically dispersed accelerators. An analysis of the node characteristics in these ecosystems suggests that Silicon Valley portfolio firms will experience higher failure rates and Irish accelerator portfolio firms will experience lower failure rates then other regions. In contrast, network theory also suggests that hubs, such as accelerators, can help embed nodes, such as start-ups, in preferred networks and that such networking can enhance firm outcomes, such as survival. Network theory also suggests that establishing network ties comes at a cost, and that accelerator and start-up resources must be adequate to enable useful network connections. Smaller cohort sizes and larger capital investments are evaluated to determine if the additional resources resulting from these practices benefit firm survival. The resulting hypotheses are evaluated via t-tests and regression analyses on data from the portfolio firms of 18 top-ranked accelerators. Our results suggest that Irish accelerator portfolio firms experience lower failure rates than portfolio firms from other regions. Interestingly these results demonstrated only modest absolute differences in regional outcomes despite significant differences in the outcome objectives of the regional funding sources in Silicon Valley and Ireland which were considered in detail. Variation in accelerator practice on funding levels and cohort size were not found to significantly impact firm outcomes although accelerator experience was found to be significant to portfolio firm survival.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2049-1050,,978-1-909507-61-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,425,433,,,,,,,,,WOS:000362358400001,,,,,

From a managerial point of view, the Resource-Based Theory considers that the founder's access to resources is an important mean for entrepreneurial performance (Bordieu 1983; Alvarez and Busenitz, 2001). Build under the Resource-Based Theory, the social capital of the entrepreneur studies how the individual's social network may provide external resources (such as knowledge, skills, capital, information...) to enhance its venture performance (Bordieu 1983; Aldrich and Zimmers 1986; Coleman 1990; Lee and Jones 2010). Concretely, strong ties (such as family or friends) are good for accessing finance and other resources (Lowik et al 2012); whereas weak ties are good for accessing information about structural holes and generating creative ideas (Burt 1992, 2004; Shane and Venkataraman 2000). It then seems clear that when increasing the entrepreneur's social capital, its performance should increase. Contrarily, some researchers identified that entrepreneurs working in a networked social environment - where they have more opportunities to develop and maintain ties through new IT - are having difficulties to identify structural holes (Teece 2009). Moreover, studies found that entrepreneurs may be fortifying the embeddedness of their social network rather than building on their weak ties (Newbert and Tornikoski 2012). In this sense, we hypothesize that the new ways of communicating are driving entrepreneurs to build embeddedness within their strong ties; leaving unattended the importance of developing weak ties to identify structural holes. This research work aims to approach this existing gap through identifying how the entrepreneur's strong and weak ties have been affected by this networked social environment, and what's the specific effect on entrepreneurial performance. Therefore, the contribution of this research may be for both academics and practitioners; through providing an accurate perspective of the entrepreneur's social capital on entrepreneurial performance.",,,,"Riverola, Carla/A-9442-2015","Riverola, Carla/0000-0002-3605-206X",,,,,,,,,,,,2049-1050,,978-1-909507-61-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,773,781,,,,,,,,,WOS:000362358400040,,,,,

Most of prior studies adopt patent citation data to indicate the traces of knowledge flows. However, patent citation is a noisy indicator in reflecting technology diffusion and has limitation in identifying knowledge flows induced by personal contacts. In this paper. we propose a method for the construction of international knowledge spillover networks by incorporating patent citations with co-inventors information so as to detect the change of network structure induced by social ties of co-inventors and reflect both explicit and tacit knowledge diffusions across national frontiers. We apply the proposed method to a sample of power system related patents granted to Chinese assignees by USPTO during 2000-2007. Our results confirm that patent citation is not an adequate indicator of knowledge flows since it reflects very few knowledge exchanging channel. However, co-invented relationships which provide trace of tacit knowledge flows can complement the patent citation data to produce a fuller picture of international knowledge spillover. The incorporation of co-inventors data helps produce a Sino-American spillover network with a structure changed from extremely loose to loosely-tied in whole but cohesive locally. The cohesive subgroups contribute much to knowledge spillover from U.S. to China and dissipate internally among Chinese firms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We contribute to the literature by showing that in the MNC context, cultural and functional similarity can become more powerful sources of bias than more commonly assumed demographic characteristics such as gender or seniority. This may be driven by the salience of such boundaries in the MNC: while demographic characteristics are more broadly distributed, cultural and functional barriers create more defined and observable faultlines, often coinciding with unit boundaries. We further argue that it may not be similarity as such that matters but rather its positive impact on different dimensions of social capital, which mediate the relationship between similarity and knowledge sharing.

In response, we observe experimentation with new organization designs that are fundamentally different from existing forms of organizing. We propose that these new designs are based on an actor-oriented architectural scheme composed of three main elements: (1) actors who have the capabilities and values to self-organize; (2) commons where the actors accumulate and share resources; and (3) protocols, processes, and infrastructures that enable multi-actor collaboration. We demonstrate the usefulness of the actor-oriented scheme by applying it to organizations drawn from four different sectors: global professional services, open source software development, computer equipment, and national defense.

The total number of ""friends"" was just over 200 - fairly close to Dunbar's 'offline' 150, which questions the validity of McAfee's assertion about the significantly better pronounced use of weak ties in Web 2.0: it appears that there is little difference between online social networks and those from the physical world. As far as demographic determinants are concerned, there was a statistically significant negative correlation between the total number of connections and age. As for the gender, there was a high degree of uniformity. In order to check if there was any observable influence by the level of collectivism, the means of high (predominantly Anglo-Saxon) and low (mostly Russia) individualism countries were calculated and compared. Same as above, the statistical significance was not high enough for the results to be deemed conclusive. Overall, although most of the trends shown were not pronounced well enough for a definitive conclusion to be drawn, I would believe this study is a first step in the right direction. With sample numbers increased and the instrumental error improved, some further insights into the determinants of the strength of ties on social networking sites can be gained, which would have practical consequences for KM 2.0.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-908272-64-5,,,,2012,,,,,,,93,99,,,,,,,,,WOS:000321973400011,,,,,

For speedy and economic access to knowledge, modern knowledge workers develop and maintain knowledge sharing ties with colleagues who work in similar professions and knowledge domains. The ties between knowledge workers develop through work associations and/or personal interactions. Such ties are formed irrespective of the organizational boundaries and formal structures and known as ego-centered networks of professionals. Ego-centered knowledge networks have not been recognised as efficient means of acquiring work-specific knowledge in the knowledge management literature. Research is needed to understand how ego-centric knowledge networks provide ready access to work-specific knowledge that can help professionals to solve complex problems and improve performance at work. Using theories of social capital and social exchange, we try to answer questions what role ego-centered networks play in coordinating work-specific knowledge and how do professionals collaborate to share knowledge in the absence of organisational control mechanisms. Data is collected through a questionnaire survey from 342 individuals working in a variety of professions and industry sectors in New Zealand. Questions were asked to find the existence of ego-centred knowledge networks around professionals and the use of this network to acquire work-specific knowledge. Our results provide evidence that professionals share work-specific knowledge in their ego-centered knowledge networks as they believe this would help them improving their problem solving capability and performance at work. Professionals believe that norm of reciprocity is important in fostering informal knowledge collaboration with peers.

The level of specialization has increased in many branches, necessitating an emphasis on integrating the knowledge of many people with diverse backgrounds. Communication is key for both creative tasks and the coordination of processes. Despite the introduction of a variety of different IT-mediated communication systems in the last decades, the critical importance of face-to-face communication has remained untouched. Direct encounters enable people to gain trust in one another and to transfer more than just the spoken language. An encounter between people who were not planning to meet may be especially fruitful. Such coincidental meetings, so-called chance encounters, lead to the creation of weak ties, i.e. loose relationships. These facilitate access to new knowledge while keeping the diversity of opinions high. Encounters also catalyze the transformation of loose relationships into strong ties. Strong ties are especially important for efficient coordination. Workspace design may help to coordinate work, reveal conflicting opinions to a greater or lesser degree, help management steer knowledge creation and support company-wide projects. Chance encounters especially are vital for knowledge sharing, knowledge creation and the development of new and innovative ideas. Based on two case studies in the pharmaceutical industry and in academia, this paper presents a framework that illustrates the impact of workspace design on encounters and communication. A holistic view of the design of the working environment, including its influence on the interactions between the employees and the barriers to and enablers of the flow of information, is presented. The findings show that the architecture of a building and the design of a workplace are important factors in increasing the number of face-to-face chance encounters. Another important, yet subordinate, factor which influences the number of chance encounters is the physical proximity to other researchers and companies. However, IT is the sphere of interaction in which most of the chance encounters take place. The findings of this study can help innovation managers and architects to shape innovative activities consciously. The framework and the figures which are presented in this paper finally help us to understand where chance encounters take place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-908272-67-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,190,197,,,,,,,,,WOS:000321565500023,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach - In this study, samples were selected from the legislative election of 2008 conducted in Taiwan, and focused on the candidates' competition strategies in the five major cities with the highest population density in Taiwan. Findings - The findings in this study indicate that the relationship among the three main external networks supports the curvilinear effect for gathering fundraising activities/contributions for the election. However, the impact of the number of votes obtained only reveals positive statistical significance on the part of individuals, not of firms and groups, despite the indication of a positive relationship. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study is that only the election of members for the Legislative Yuan in Taiwan is used. The study could be further extended to look into other types of elections, such as the election of representatives and councilors for the counties and also the presidential election. A comparative analysis for different types of elections could also be performed to find out whether there are any other different implications for the election strategies. Practical implications - It is realized only through members' levels of collective goal orientation and shared trust, which create value by facilitating successful collective action. Originality/value - There are very few discussions of the multidimensional treatments of social relationships when applying to competition strategies.

An original viewpoint is presented in this chapter - the thinking is novel to integration literature and thought, and to social networks - that advances both research and practice of PMI. Since the network-view may be a new topic to many PMI researchers, the central discussion is preceded by a brief introduction to the concepts and techniques of social network analysis. The author offers that the organizational members' pre-existing social network can become disrupted by integration processes, which creates pressures on the individuals' previously stable social network. The individual members will therefore strive for a restabilization of their localized social network towards a specific pattern that is somewhat unique to each individual. During this social realignment there is an opportunity for integration managers to embrace this ""social reconciliation."" By recognizing the individuals' imminent stabilization point of this natural process, integration managers can proactively guide the social network toward an optimal, or productive, resting space that provides organizational benefit. This chapter puts forward the particulars of this phenomenon and offers exploratory suggestions for how a practitioner might influence the re-establishment of the organizational social network in a manner consistent with individuals' preferences and simultaneously beneficial to the organization overall.

Firms would be proactively asking for the complementarity between the activities of internal knowledge creation and the assimilation of external knowledge from different sources, forming strategic alliances between them. Specifically, innovation can be regarded as resulting from research opportunities focused on how knowledge creation and diffusion processes would benefit from localized knowledge spillovers between firms colocated within industrial clusters, defined as a network of personnel, or an interorganizational and institutional network. However, the literature has not yet well understood how these processes benefit from both these localized knowledge spillovers and networks within the cluster or whether their effects are consistently positive. This chapter, grounded in the resource-based view, the Scandinavian Approach to the industrial district, and the social capital perspective, and with a multilevel analysis, presents a synthesis of the existing theory on the knowledge creation and transfer processes within industrial districts, and proposes a theoretical framework by studying in depth the relationships between district-level and firm-specific capacities, as well as the effects of the in tracluster networks on both the firm's knowledge-generative and absorptive capacities, and its skill in facing both incremental and radical technological innovation. This understanding of the topic allows the proposition of firm-specific strategies for value creation and value appropriation in intracluster networks and alliances by increasing the company's exploration and knowledge-absorption capacities.",,,,"CAMISON, CESAR/F-4582-2016","CAMISON, CESAR/0000-0001-8568-8825",,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-61735-692-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,237,277,,,,,,,,,WOS:000299397100011,,,,,

Also, Wilkinson's (1991) interactional field theory is presented as a way to understand how not only network ties, but the content that flows over those ties in the form of a common community purpose, can equally structure behavior around entrepreneurship. Hypotheses are generated from these social theories and tested empirically using a six-community case study involving both entrepreneurs and institutional actors/representatives in both high- and low-entrepreneurship communities. Interaction and purpose are examined to understand how these may differ across communities with different levels of entrepreneurship.

For example, SNS (social network service) companies now sell customers digital decorative products for the adornment of online avatars. Not only do individual customers consume these digital products, but they also exchange them as gifts in their local neighborhoods. While previous studies on customer valuation (e.g. CLTV, RFM, etc.) focus on some important issues for identifying valuable customers, the literature does not resolve issues related to the effects on customer value of products purchased as gifts for another person. This study attempts to verify empirically the effects of two representative social network properties (tie strength and the number of ties) on customer monetary value. This study selects 2615 customers from a South Korean SNS website who enrolled on the site on the same day. Data include diverse purchase-related information, social network properties in terms of gift-giving for six months, and demographic information. The primary results of this study are as follows. First, the proposed model, which includes social network properties, has a great deal more explanatory power than the baseline model - the RFM-based customer value model. Second, tie strength and the number of ties in a gift-giving network increase customer value. Third, tie strength has a more profound impact on customer value than does the number of ties. The results of this study theoretically expand the domain of customer valuation studies due to the inclusion of social network properties, and suggest important practical implications for some online SNS companies in their efforts to find valuable customers and improve customer value.

Strong ties, however, have also shown to prevent innovation, suggesting that firms should also develop weak ties to other customer groups. This paper focuses on the potential for strong ties to facilitate, rather than prohibit, innovation. It is based in a 7-year longitudinal research project with Adidas, a global sporting goods company. From the case, we find that the paradox of tie strength results from an overly simplified view of the nature of company-customer relationships. Contrary to the established literature, we find that strong ties in the Adidas case supported significant innovation. In fact, the involvement resulted in the development of a new product with a radically different product architecture and led to one of the most successful product launches in the company's history. To explain these findings, we introduce the nature of customer participation in a firm's value creation processes as a new dimension of the constitution of firm-customer ties and discuss how such a kind of relationship can develop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0033-6807,,,,,NOV,2011,41,5,,,,,470,484,,10.1111/j.1467-9310.2011.00659.x,,,,,,,WOS:000296362500004,,,,,

We conceptualized social capital along three dimensions (structural, relational and contextual) and examined the relationships between social capital along these dimensions and two types of performance (managerial and innovative), using data collected from the strategic product development departments of six large Korean manufacturing firms. As expected, we found a significant relationship between the centrality of a network and individual performance. When network centrality was decomposed into three types (advice centrality, influence centrality and idea centrality), however, the relative strength of each type changed significantly based on performance type. We also found that the number of weak ties had a significant positive effect both on innovative and managerial performance. When considered together with network centrality and absorptive capacity, however, weak ties turned out to be nonsignificant as predictors of managerial performance, but the strongest predictors of innovative performance. In contrast, absorptive capacity had a positive effect on both types of individual performance, while its strength as a determinant of individual performance was weaker than that of network centrality and weak ties.

However, less attention has been paid to the factors that entice actors to shape social networks during the process of the development of new ideas. This research was conducted in an R&D facility of a semi-conductor company. We analysed the generation of five creative projects and their development over a four-year period. We used a longitudinal approach and collected data through interviews and observations to identify the creative contributions and the actors who were involved at different time periods for each project. We mapped the relationships between actors who contributed to the development of each idea through creative thinking and/or helped it to become accepted both internally and externally over three-year windows. This method generated data on network evolution. We also carried out a qualitative analysis and identified four main factors explaining why actors turn to others during the idea-development process: (1) to gain access to information; (2) to enhance credibility; (3) to exercise one's influence; and (4) to gain access to knowledge through people or objects. We demonstrate that different types of ties or network structures are relied upon to reap different kinds of benefits.

Yet, many executives eschew or ignore this form of media because they don't understand what it is, the various forms it can take, and how to engage with it and learn. In response, we present a framework that defines social media by using seven functional building blocks: identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. As different social media activities are defined by the extent to which they focus on some or all of these blocks, we explain the implications that each block can have for how firms should engage with social media. To conclude, we present a number of recommendations regarding how firms should develop strategies for monitoring, understanding, and responding to different social media activities.

An organizational embeddedness perspective,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES,,,,,,,,,,,,"We apply an organizational embeddedness perspective to examine international assignees' retention with the organization. Specifically, we hypothesize that assignees' social ties within and their perceived fit with the host unit positively relate to two sacrifices on leaving the organization: their firm-specific learning during the assignment, and their perceived career prospects in the organization. Perceived career prospects are expected to predict subsequent retention, moderated by firm-specific learning. These hypotheses are tested using a sample of 143 inpatriates in 10 German multinationals, with retention measured 2 and 4 years later. We show that inpatriates' trusting ties with HQ staff and their fit with the HQ positively relate to their firm-specific learning and their perceived career prospects, and that the latter predicts their retention 2 and 4 years later. Perceived career prospects mediate the direct relationship between inpatriates' fit with the HQ and inpatriate retention, and the indirect relationship between inpatriates' trusting ties with HQ staff and their retention. Furthermore, inpatriates' firm-specific learning mitigates the effect of perceived career prospects on retention decisions 2 years later. We contribute to the organizational embeddedness, careers, and international business literatures by explaining when and how facets of organizational embeddedness relate to assignee retention.

This theoretical framework originates from Fiske's (1991, 1992) Relational Models Theory (RMT). The RMT distinguishes four relational models: communal sharing, authority ranking, equality matching and market pricing. We conducted two case studies and investigated how people use different relational models for their knowledge sharing activities. Based on case studies of a governmental organization and an industrial research group, we describe how the relational context guides knowledge sharing behavior. We show that the willingness to share knowledge is rooted in different relational models and that people only share knowledge when they share similar relational models. Furthermore, effective knowledge sharing takes place when incentive systems and knowledge management systems are appropriated to the relational model in use. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

By drawing on a novel approach that explores dual embeddedness and its impacts on differences across a set of subsidiaries in terms of innovative performance over time, this paper extends our understanding of embeddedness as part of strategic asset-seeking strategies.

Network range facilitates access to a broad set of knowledge and resources; however these resources may be activated only in the presence of strong ties. Alternatively, a network heavy in strong ties provides reliable connections, but a lack of range can lead to network closure. Using a sample of 452 TE ventures, we find that tie strength enhances venture performance, but network range does not have a significant effect. Furthermore, taken together, tie strength and network range significantly enhance TE venture performance. Supermodularity and linear restriction tests indicate asymmetric complementarity between network range and tie strength.

The first objective of the study relates to providing new insights into the international market development activities through the application of a network perspective. The chapter reviews the international business literature to ascertain the development of thought, the research gaps, and the shortcomings. This review shows that the network perspective is a useful and popular theoretical domain that researchers can use to understand international activities, particularly of small, high technology, resource-constrained firms. The second research objective is to gain a deeper understanding of network capability. This chapter presents a model for the impact of network capability on international performance by building on the emerging literature on the dynamic capabilities view of the firm. The model conceptualizes network capability in terms of network characteristics, network operation, and network resources. Network characteristics comprise strong and weak ties (operationalized as foreign-market entry modes), relational capability, and the level of trust between partners. Network operation focuses on network initiation, network coordination, and network learning capabilities. Network resources comprise network human-capital resources, synergy-sensitive resources (resource combinations within the network), and information sharing within the network. The third research objective is to determine the impact of networking capability on the international performance of SMEs. The study analyzes 11 hypotheses through structural equations modeling using LISREL. The hypotheses relate to strong and weak ties, the relative strength of strong ties over weak ties, and each of the eight remaining constructs of networking capability in the study. The research conducts a cross-sectional study by using a sample of SMEs drawn from the telecommunications industry in Ireland. The study supports the hypothesis that strong ties are more influential on international performance than weak ties. Similarly, network coordination and human-capital resources have a positive and significant association with international performance. Strong ties, weak ties, trust, network initiation, synergy-sensitive resources, relational capability, network learning, and information sharing do not have a significant association with international performance. The results of this study are strong (R-2 = 0.63 for performance as the outcome) and provide a number of interesting insights into the relations between collaboration or networking capability and performance. This study provides managers and policy makers with an improved understanding of the contingent effects of networks to highlight situations where networks might have limited, zero, or even negative effects on business outcomes. The study cautions against the tendency to interpret networks as universally beneficial to business development and performance outcomes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1069-0964,,978-1-78052-024-7,,,,2011,17,,,,,,199,376,,10.1108/S1069-0964(2011)0000017006,,,,,,,WOS:000301876500003,,,,,

Since the inception of web 2.0 the popularity of social networks (SNS) has continued to increase. Some SNS are based on six degreess of separation (6SNS), and these have emerged as the most frequently visited WWW sites. Design/methodology/approach - Using a randomized control group pre-test-post-test experimental design, responses to a questionaire to test the differences among 6SNS users and non-users on 12 issues of benefit were analyzed. Findings - The tests show, first, that, compared with traditional virtual communities, SNS evoke higher ratings for ""trust in website,"" ""trust in other members,"" and ""quality of friends."" Second, SNS can provide users with entertainment and greater social involvement. People who use these sites express postive attitudes about them. Third, no significant differences were found between SNS and traditional internet media on ""meeting new friends,"" ""maintaining relationships,"" ""searching for friends,"" ""searching for information,"" and ""understanding and learning."" These results can be attributed to language differences. Originality/value - The value of 6SNS is recognized by the business world.

Specifically, how does the density of informal networks affect an actor's ability to access and integrate diverse information and consequently that actor's innovation performance? The arguments are developed using the setting of 79 senior partners in a global management consulting firm and tested on a dataset of 1,449 informal relationships. I distinguish between internal, external, local, and global relations and find that this separation permits a more nuanced understanding of the effect of network structure on innovation performance. Specifically, I argue that the most effective network strategy is contingent upon the context in which the partners operate. The findings show that partners operating in homogeneous contexts, where the primary challenge is to access diverse information, benefit from low-density networks. In contrast, when crossing both firm and geographic boundaries, partners with dense networks have higher innovation performance. I argue that in such heterogeneous contexts, dense network interactions facilitate partners' ability to integrate the diverse information to which they are exposed.

However, inadequate efforts have been made to synthesize the way in which different components of social capital dynamically influence innovation. This paper reviews existing empirical studies on the relationship between social capital and innovation of the individual, team, organization, city and nation. Analyses were carried out to identify consensus, discordances and gaps in the social capital-innovation connection. The findings suggested that the structural components of social capital, including ego network size, structural holes, tie strength and centrality have a significant impact on innovation. Their impact, however, tends to be moderated by contextual and intellectual factors, such as the nature and type of innovation, internal vs external ties, costs of maintaining the ties and existing intellectual capital. The relational components of social capital, trust and cognitive norms, demonstrated a consistently positive relationship with innovation across contexts. The cognitive components of social capital have not sufficiently established their contribution to innovation apart from the other two dimensions. Several insights regarding the general literature on social capital and innovation were identified, including the conceptualization of social capital, measurement of innovation, and the causal relationship between social capital and innovation.

This research proposes three social network characteristics (tie strength, density and centrality) and examines their influence on the subjective norm construct.

The focal unit of adoption has mainly been individuals and organizations, however, research at the group or social network levels as well as the interorganizational level has recently gained increased interest from information systems (IS) researchers. This recent focus views the world as being the sum of all relations. Various social network theories exist that seek to emphasize different proficiencies of social networks and explain theoretical mechanisms for behavior in social networks. The core idea of these theories is that social networks are valuable, and the relations among actors affect the behavior of individuals, groups, organizations, industries, and societies. IS researchers have also found that social network theory can help explain technology adoption. Some researchers, in addition, acknowledge that most adoption situations involve phenomena occurring at multiple levels, yet most technology adoption research applies a single level of analysis. Multilevel research can address the levels of theory, measurement, and analysis required to fully examining research questions.

Methodology/approach - We briefly review previous international management literature and show that the conception of MNC embeddedness in external networks is often simplistic. We develop the concept of the HQ-subsidiary dyad being externally embedded and derive propositions on how this more holistic concept of MNC embeddedness influences subsidiary contribution. Findings - We argue that subsidiary contribution depends not only on the relational embeddedness dimension of the subsidiary but that there is a complex interplay between several embeddedness dimensions on multiple levels. We suggest that the much emphasized effect of subsidiary relational embeddedness might be contingent on the HQ's own relationships, and the structure of the overall network. We also develop propositions which show that subsidiary relational embeddedness mediates the relationship between overall network structure and subsidiary contribution. Research limitations - For the sake of theoretical stringency, we keep other influencing factors such as MNC strategy and specific subsidiary mandates as constant. Originality/value of the chapter - Subsidiaries are an important source of firm-level competitive advantage. Subsidiary resources have also been shown to develop to a large extent in relationships with external actors.

Thirdly, cognitive social capital refers to the meaningful contexts of communication among and between actors, and includes the shared language, codes and narratives used to create understanding. However, the rich linkages between structural, relational and cognitive social capital across equivalent/hierarchical social space and geographical boundaries are neglected. A further research focus identified is that the role of face-to-face and the increasingly routine tool of electronic mediated communication may produce different characteristics and levels of social capital. The paper also discusses the ways in which critical realism and mixed methodology may enhance understanding of the process-based linkages between structural, relational and cognitive social capital.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1460-8545,,,,,SEP,2009,11,3,,,,,247,273,,10.1111/j.1468-2370.2008.00244.x,,,,,,,WOS:000268703500001,,,,,

Yet, social interactions also often occur in larger settings, and group-based research has shown group sizes to affect its member behavior. To this end, we set out to examine WOM transmission in a larger context by introducing a WOM responder, whose role is to provide a second opinion to the WOM recipient. In Experiment 1, we find that social relations in the triad play a key role in WOM transmission. For strong ties, the WOM responder showed little difference in willingness to offer a second opinion irrespective of its congruency with the first opinion. Incongruency with the first opinion, however, reduced the valence of the second opinion. For weak ties, the presence (vs. absence) of first opinion-irrespective of its congruency-increased the likelihood of offering a second opinion and also its valence. We demonstrate that the effects could be attributable to different accessibility of needs for assimilation and differentiation as well as of motivational orientations toward other parties of WOM. Experiment 2 takes a closer look at the conflicting motivations of social influence (normative vs. informational) associated with strong ties, and finds both in operation but to a differing degree. Finally, a follow-up study addresses the current findings in the context of satisfied/dissatisfied consumers. (C) 2009 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Using data on informal exchanges among investment bankers in the equities division of a large financial services firm operating in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, and the Americas in 2001, we find that network closure in relationships in which the banker acts as an acquirer of information increases his or her performance, whereas closure in relationships in which the banker acts as a provider of information decreases it. We also find that these effects are moderated by the bankers' ability to employ alternative means (such as formal authority) to induce the cooperation of exchange partners in their acquirer role, as well as by the extent to which the bankers can benefit from being free from the control of exchange partners in their provider role. Our findings highlight the two sides of the normative control associated with network closure: control benefits people when they need to induce exchange partners to behave according to their preferences, but it hurts them when it forces them to behave according to the preferences of those partners.",,,,"ERTUG, Gokhan/D-2222-2010; Gargiulo, Martin/B-3684-2010",,,,,,,,,,,,,0001-8392,1930-3815,,,,JUN,2009,54,2,,,,,299,333,,10.2189/asqu.2009.54.2.299,,,,,,,WOS:000268585600004,,,,,

Specifically, we probe how both intraunit relational capital (within a unit) and interunit relational capital (across units) enable units to build knowledge combination capabilities and how such capabilities affect their performance. Data collected from senior managers in 122 knowledge units indicate that: (1) both intra- and interunit relational capital are positively related to knowledge combination capability; (2) knowledge combination capability is positively associated with enhanced unit performance; (3) knowledge combination capability fully mediates the relationship between interunit relational capital and unit performance; and (4) intraunit relational capital impacts both directly and indirectly (through knowledge combination capability) on unit performance. The findings suggest that interunit relational capital entails greater variation in knowledge stocks and thus may lead to more radical innovation than intra-relational capital that entails more similar knowledge bases and, thus, produces more incremental innovations.

Ubiquitous proximity e-service highlights the collective effort focused on collecting the user group's power as the reference for ubiquitous trust decisions. Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides some theoretical utility support for ubiquitous proximity e-service. The ""homophily"" describes the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others. By highlighting the ""homophily"" of e-service participants, these isolated individuals can be treated as a group with proximity. The main value of ubiquitous proximity e-service utilizes the network effect from the collective effort of interpersonal social network. Findings - In order to leap the trust barrier for users to embrace these ubiquitous e-services, ubiquitous proximity e-service makes it possible for users to collaborate with their nearby user groups to establish a reliable and trustworthy interaction environment. The simulation outcomes for trust decision quality enhancement show a significant improvement in a variety of environment settings. Practical implications - A significant value of ubiquitous proximity e-service lies in the increased possibility of establishing innovative social network relationships. From the interpersonal perspective, unfamiliar strangers can make connections with individuals who are proximal and homoplastic to them. The strength of proximity gives people better chances to make interpersonal connections, including both weak ties and strong ties. By combining those interpersonal tie relationships, ubiquitous proximity e-service can easily cause information diffusion and effectively encourage collective wisdom.

This paper introduces two dimensions that influence such a transfer: ""ease of transfer"" and ""motivation to transfer."" The varying degree to which these dimensions exist in the source and recipient bring in asymmetries. This contributes to knowledge as most studies have assumed symmetric behaviours between source and recipient in tacit knowledge transfer. It is critical to identify these asymmetries in managing tacit knowledge transfer as intervention strategies differ. Appropriately applied intervention strategies not only enable transfer, but also facilitate learning and growth.

Even if coded knowledge is easier to diffuse, the role of tacit knowledge is often essential for being able to use coded knowledge. Coded knowledge can even be unusable without the augmentation of tacit knowledge. The role of organizational culture is highly relevant for tacit knowledge sharing, which is social activity, face-to-face interaction and therefore can be influenced only through culture. This paper represents a theoretical research about how the types of organizational culture according to the Competitive Values Framework model are supportive for tacit knowledge sharing. The Competing Values Framework consists of four culture types: clan, adhocracy, market and hierarchy. Clan culture is found to support tacit knowledge sharing all, factors described refer to clan culture values and description. Adhocracy culture is the second culture type most supporting tacit knowledge sharing. Market and hierarchy hardly do so, and organizations willing to increase tacit knowledge sharing will have to increase the presence in their culture of clan and adhocracy types. These findings provide with insights, which put us closer to better understanding what factors to use to change organization in the direction of ""high"" tacit knowledge sharing. The article does not claim the final truthfulness of these conclusions, but more calls for further practical research to validate or disclaim them as well as provide with the extent of validity of these conclusions, which the author will carry out.

We theorize that negative interpersonal affect renders task competence virtually irrelevant in a person's choice of a partner for task interactions but that positive interpersonal affect increases a person's reliance on competence as a criterion for choosing task partners, facilitating access to organizational resources relevant to the task. Using social psychological models of interpersonal perception and hierarchical Bayesian models, we find support for this theory in social network data from employees in three organizations: an entrepreneurial computer technology company, staff personnel at an academic institution, and employees in a large information technology corporation. The results suggest that competence may be irrelevant not just when outright dislike colors a relationship.

Specifically, very central and very peripheral positions of team leaders within the work-flow and awareness network hamper team creativity, whereas peripheral situated team leaders within the information network propel the creativity. In addition, team leaders stimulate creativity when they stay central in the external information network.

Six research questions are formulated with the aim to establish if and how functional membership and informal patterns of communication within an organization influence whether and why employees are willing to engage in product design modifications. We selected as a field site for our study an industrial company that had an internal research and product development operations and where the employees were located on the same site. A three-step approach within the manufacturing case company was designed: (1) In-depth interviews were carried out with managers and employees; (2) a survey questionnaire was sent out to all employees involved with a specific product that is subject to potential design modifications; and (3) a post hoc group feedback session was organized to further discuss our findings with the management. First, analysis of the nine in-depth interviews establishes a taxonomy of product design decisions involving four types of criteria; product-related, service-related, market-related, and feasibility-related criteria explain why employees would engage or not in product design modifications. Second, it is demonstrated that functional membership has a significant influence on the concern for these decision-making criteria as well as on the decision to proceed or not with product design modifications. In other words, functional membership influences whether and why employees are more or less willing to make product design modifications. In this manufacturing company, a global industrial player, the differences in concern appear especially for service- and market-related criteria and pertain particularly to the research and development (R&D) and service function. Overall, even though the perceived performance of the specific product under study did not differ significantly among the different departments, it is observed that R&D employees were significantly less in favor of proceeding with product design modifications than other employees were. Third, using UCINET VI software, we provide some explanations for this finding. It is shown that informal patterns of communication (i.e., employee degree centrality) operate a situational opportunity to make modifications to an existing product and a cognitive opportunity influencing the decision to modify product design following an inverted U-shaped function. Ultimately, we derive practical guidelines for an ideal product-team composition to reduce product design decision-making bias.",,,,"Lindgreen, Adam/D-4103-2019","Lindgreen, Adam/0000-0001-7881-7350",,,,,,,,,,,,0737-6782,1540-5885,,,,NOV,2008,25,6,,,,,528,545,,10.1111/j.1540-5885.2008.00320.x,,,,,,,WOS:000259087300002,,,,,

This trade-off derives from the opposing implications of having redundant (i.e., directly or indirectly linked) contacts. Insofar as egos alters are nonredundant, ego can be expected to become more knowledgeable more quickly. And such nonredundancy can also be the basis for great power as ego monopolizes the flow of resources (including information) between egos alters. However, the very same mechanism that is behind egos power as a provider of resources - i.e., the possession of nonsubstituitable resources on the part of disconnected contacts also implies that that egos alters will themselves be monopolists, thus weakening ego as an acquirer of resources. Furthermore, while the surplus earned from providing resources on monopoly terms is potentially much greater than the surplus earned from acquiring resources on competitive terms, the former strategy carries the risk that socially distant actors will not value one anothers resources. Beyond elucidating the trade-off in the social structural foundation of knowledge and power, our framework also shows how the opposing implications of redundancy are the basis for a broad family of well known trade-offs (cosmopolitanism versus localism; exploration versus exploitation; insider versus stranger; robust versus simple identities) whose relationships with one another and with power and knowledge have not been appreciated. For all such trade-offs, the greater potential returns afforded by nonredundancy are balanced by the surer returns available from redundancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-6491,1464-3650,,,,OCT,2008,17,5,,,,,903,944,,10.1093/icc/dtn036,,,,,,,WOS:000259327600001,,,,,

Drawing on knowledge-based, resource dependence, and relational theories, the authors argue that the impact of a firm's customers on new product development depends on the size and relational embeddedness of the customer portfolio and the extent to which the firm is dependent on one or a few dominant customers for a majority of its revenues. The authors test the research model using longitudinal data on young firms operating in business-to-business markets in six technology-based industries. The results indicate that customer portfolio size has an inverse U-shaped relationship to the number of new products developed and that the more relationally embedded the customer set, the more new products the firm develops. Dependence stemming from revenue concentration has a negative impact on new product output. Furthermore, the authors find that relational embeddedness can compensate for too small of a customer portfolio and can help offset the negative effects of a highly concentrated portfolio. These results make important theoretical and empirical contributions to the new product development literature, helping uncover some of the antecedents of innovative productivity particularly relevant for young, technology-based firms.

Human capital has certainly had its importance, but how to coordinate human capital in order to push productivity in research and development without compromising individual initiative is still not well understood. In this paper, we provide results showing that geometry of workspace has indeed an impact on communication patterns and may thus be used as a means to drive both innovation and efficient research. In order to be creative, new knowledge has to be created. Communication facilitates knowledge creation. We try to close the bridge between areas of creation of tacit knowledge and transfer of knowledge highlighted by authors like Nonaka, Takeuchi, Konno, von Krogh and von Hippel with the area of communication patterns pioneered by Allen, Hatch, and Stryker, by considering face-to-face (FTF) communication as a first step for socialization, socialization as a means for knowledge creation. In this article, we compare two different office environments within the same site, same activity, same hierarchical level and same company: a traditional cell office area and a new multi-space office, used by people who used to work in cell offices. We observed FTF communication patterns during 120 h in two areas and measured over 2,000 communication events. We found that people communicate three times more often in a multi-space area than in a cell-space area. We also found that the mean duration of communication events decreased from 9 to 3 min when transferring collaborators from a cell-space to a multi-space. Finally time spent without communication increased from 5% to 29% when going from cell-offices to multi-space areas - leaving more time for people to work and think on their own.

In an empirical analysis of our thesis in the formation of syndicate relations between U.

The strategic navigation from creative exploration to global exploitation through the use of so-called transformation networks is particularly highlighted. The creativity phase requires a creator with visionary leadership. The commercialisation phase, on the other hand, requires technology integration and global marketing excellence. Realising that this requires more than a bright inventor, the creator of Anoto brought in the right complementary assets at distinct phases of the commercialisation process. Our case illustrates how integrator and marketeer profiles were brought into a networked act of entrepreneurship for joint navigation across an ocean of relationships that gave birth to a global standard for digital writing. By combining theories on open innovation and networking, a theoretical framework is developed to analyse the different nature of the networks (or the value creation structure) in which complementary assets can be accessed, transferred and transformed into commercialised innovation. The analysis suggests that the value of complementary assets are embedded in and unlocked by three distinct types of networks: creativity networks, transformation networks and process networks. It also suggests that the ideal approach to accessing complementary assets shifts over the research and development management process, and happens through these three different types and levels of networks, requiring fundamentally different approaches to leadership and relationship management.

The question is ""how do firms face the challenge of acquiring resources and developing capabilities during their day-to-day activities in order to face competition?"" Case study research involving day-to-day activities of a project-firm in a B2B context suggests that social capital - the sum of structural, relational and cognitive resources - built in networks increases the ability to face the challenge of resource acquisition and capability development even during daily activities. A communication network study clearly maps this influence of social capital. More precisely, dominant or powerful employees should be avoided. Next to organizational structures characterized by hierarchy, high and low communications are also not desirable. Moreover, too much trust can harm firms' abilities to develop capabilities when performing day-to-day activities. Even a complete shared vision hinders firms' capability development during their day-to-day activities. This study supports the negative impact of overembeddedness; shows the value of articles discussing the downside of social capital and confirms the paradox of embeddedness: overembeddedness as well as underembeddedness has negative implications for a firm's performance. Moreover, from the research results important managerial lessons can be deducted, such as (1) the basis for performance differences can be formed during day-to-day activities and (2) social capital management is a critical success factor in outperforming competitors. Therefore, managers should be aware of the potential value embedded in their day-to-day activities and relationships based on economic transactions. They can leverage their day-to-day activities and relationships based on economic transactions and consider them as sources for resources and capabilities that can be deployed in their search for a competitive position.

It posits that individual differences in a personality variable called need for cognition capture differences in actors' cognitive motivation to realize the potential information benefits that exist in their social networks.

As a consequence of this shift in the economy, an increasing number of industries are moving from the closed innovation model to the open innovation model that created porous boundaries between the innovative company and its surrounding environment, changing the inter- and intra-organizational modes of coordination. In an environment where knowledge is the key economic resource and the open innovation model is applied in more and more industries, we are experiencing the increasing importance of the New Technology-Based Firm (NTBF). NTBFs face a number of difficulties mainly associated with a lack of resources and entrepreneurial skills and in order overcome the difficulties NTBFs strive towards flexibility while accelerating the development and commercialization processes by creating and/or entering business networks. By adopting a knowledge-based view for NTBFs and consequently placing knowledge in the centre of a systemic innovation model, knowledge networks constitute an asset for NTBFs. As this new form of cooperation takes multiple and often unpredictable forms it is thus essential to develop strategy formulation tools and processes that can help NTBFs to face their challenges. Until now little attention has been given to the development of strategy tools and processes tailored for the requirements of NTBFs. The present paper presents a concept to cope with NTBFs' by developing a generic process for strategy formulation. In this respect, an action research project was initiated. The proposed concept was initially designed, although not exclusively, for a Greek NTBF, Astrofos Ltd. The author, who is coordinator of the incubator where Astrofos is sited, is acting as-a strategy consultant for the firm and has taken part in all its major decisions since summer 2007. In order to build the strategy formulation process, this paper proposes a mapping technique that attempts to depict a NTBF's tangible and intangible transactions as well as the strength of ties between the focal NTBF and its partners and the complexity of the knowledge. In developing the mapping technique, we have used a combination of the concept of weak ties, derived from social network analysis, with the notion of complex knowledge, as this combination was initially proposed by Hansen (1999). Additionally, a set of questions is proposed that have to be answered in order to pass from knowledge identification to knowledge transfer, from a strategic point of view. In this regard, the presented methodology constitutes an effort, on the one hand, to study the emergent patterns in what is considered to be a chaotic or disordered system and, on the other, to stimulate the creation of new patterns in the system that would be consistent with the NTBF's strategy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-906638-16-0,,,,2008,,,,,,,279,287,,,,,,,,,WOS:000260973300032,,,,,

This paper will first explain how came that we faced this question in the research department of our university, then tell the story of how we are answering it by means of a new kind of knowledge network called ""CoRe"" and finally reflect on lessons we are learning about weak ties cooperation. The Swiss Distance University of Applied Sciences is organized in a radically decentralized way combined with traditional hierarchical structures and functional divisions. This has led to an insufficient level of interactions between geographically distributed university members (academic staff, students) so that weak ties have become the norm. In research one major consequence was that research activities were too much isolated in the departments, human resources were dispersed and research knowledge did not flow enough. Projects were small and less recognised, know how got easily lost and research tools' development was too slow. How to meet the challenge of improving research performances under conditions of weak ties like these? Our approach consisted in a collaborative knowledge strategy: to create and cultivate CoRe, an intra-organizational knowledge network of researchers (academic staff, students) organized as a community of practice connecting its members around the common task of stewarding research knowledge. This paper provides first an overview of how we are designing, implementing and cultivating the CoRe knowledge network and then reflections on the new subject of weak ties cooperation as realized in CoRe. In the first part, after introducing the background of the CoRe project as well as our approach to knowledge cooperation we will present the development process and focus on the evolution of the network requirements by comparing the initial and a revised version. In both cases these requirements were collaboratively developed by the network members in two large events: a) the network launch, a future search event (June 2006) and b) the 1(st) Annual CoRe Conference (June 2007). Based on an analysis of the evolution between these two versions, in the second part our paper will provide reflections and key lessons learned about how to design and implement a collaborative knowledge strategy which is able to foster knowledge cooperation under conditions of weak ties. Here we will sketch the essential principles of our solution which consists in transferring to knowledge management lessons learned from bioteams thus building a bridge between Nature and Culture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-906638-10-8,,,,2008,,,,,,,59,66,,,,,,,,,WOS:000259556500008,,,,,

This paper finds that how matters become subjects of decision-making is at least as important part of municipal decision-making as how they are formally decided on. Both the progression of the process and the actual content of the decisions are largely resolved in preparation. The complex and rapidly changing operational environment is imposing special requirements, which are driving the municipal sector implementing new kinds of patterns. The paper deems it important that, alongside effective issues, municipal administration also strives to transcend conventional truths, search for new ideas from various non-interrelated sources, and create new possibilities from them. The paper engages with the knowledge management research tradition because the success of municipality is considered to be dependent on how efficiently the municipality can balance knowledge exploitation with knowledge exploration. Rather than focusing on administrative structures, the paper concentrates on the official and unofficial interaction processes within the preparation system, and between the preparation system and its environment, The paper finds that the interaction processes have hidden potential, which can be translated into a resource for balancing effectiveness and innovativeness. The resulting complexity-based framework, which can be seen as the main contribution of this paper, shows that paying attention to the interrelationships between the various actors and invisible dynamics of the preparation system provides a new perspective on the challenges facing municipal preparatory work. The complexity-based framework can be seen as an 'enabling structure' that facilitates the running of the preparation system and simultaneously ensures the co-evolution between the preparation system and the surrounding environment. This framework consists of five dimensions, which are: (i) interaction and feedback, (ii) trust, (iii) internal mechanisms, (iv) diversity, and (v) sense of timing and coevolution. The complexity-based framework helps to understand how municipal communities can benefit from their internal and external knowledge reserves and adapt to changes in the operating environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-906638-10-8,,,,2008,,,,,,,333,340,,,,,,,,,WOS:000259556500038,,,,,

Moreover, Japanese manufacturers have efficient knowledge sharing practices. Therefore, we can state that Japanese manufacturers possess competitive strength from a knowledge-based view (KBM). In order to investigate the origin of this competitive strength pertaining to knowledge, which is evident in Japanese manufacturers, this paper sheds light on the rotation of personnel with regard to the research and development of forefront technology. We procured the rotation data of all the engineers (N = 1350) assigned to the central research institutes of a Japanese manufacturer. The central research institutes consisted of the material, mechatronics, e-component, and multimedia research institutes. In addition to utilizing this quantitative data, we interviewed the R&D director of the company who was familiar with all of its R&D activities. First, we analysed each research institute in 1998 based on the following criteria, and subsequently analysed each engineer's rotation term: (1) the number of engineers who had worked in the planning departments, (2) the number of engineers who had worked in the basic research institute, and (3) the number of engineers who had worked in the product development departments. Furthermore, based on the data obtained from the interviews, we were able to infer as follows. First, engineers from the planning departments play an important role in accessing the expertise of other organizations. Second, engineers from the basic research institute play a significant role in evaluating external expertise by utilizing the professional networks to which they belonged in the basic research institute. Finally, engineers from the product development departments play a crucial role in adapting the research in forefront technology to the market needs. The rotation of personnel facilitates knowledge transfer. This is because the rotated personnel bring with them new values, ideas, knowledge, and networks. In this paper, we discuss an adequate rotation policy by analysing two successful and unsuccessful research institutes. Our research subject was a large Japanese manufacturer. We revealed that the successful research institutes conducted adequate knowledge transfer through adequate rotation. Japanese manufacturers are well known as high-performance knowledge-sharing companies with strong networks. In addition to network, we revealed the aspects of an effective rotation policy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-906638-10-8,,,,2008,,,,,,,525,533,,,,,,,,,WOS:000259556500058,,,,,

However, explanations of unrelated diversification have been less than clear. A conceptual model of unrelated diversification is thus proposed. In drawing on Penrose's (1959) resource based approach, unrelated diversification is explained by an organization's 'three pillars, which consist of its strength of dynamic capabilities, absorptive capacity, and weak ties. The role of the three pillars is to discover new resource applications or uses in conditions of market failure that are characterized by 'incomplete' markets. A novel feature of this model is that an organization can diversify more broadly than predicted by Penrose (1959) and other modern resource-based approaches (Teece et al., 1997). Furthermore, unrelated diversification can be beneficial. This study also offers suggestions to measure the three pillars; its contributions and implications are discussed as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-2380,1467-6486,,,,DEC,2007,44,8,,,,,1481,1502,,10.1111/j.1467-6486.2007.00719.x,,,,,,,WOS:000251416000008,,,,,

HOW SOCIAL NETWORKS AFFECT ENTREPRENEURIAL TEAM FORMATION AND SEARCH",STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP JOURNAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"The social network perspective has become an important analytical lens for understanding strategic actions among entrepreneurs. Social theorists offer two competing visions of networks' configurations: one of infinite opportunities for individuals to develop heterogeneous circles of affiliations and the other of constrained opportunities privileging only certain individuals. We draw on this tension to describe three models of network formation - random, small world, and truncated scale free - and apply them to entrepreneurial team formation and resource mobilization strategies undertaken by entrepreneurs. We compare and contrast two models of team formation - a rational process model and an interpersonal relations model - and identify the network contexts under which each is most applicable. Mundane entrepreneurial teams arise within localized clusters and appear unlikely to take advantage of what network theorists have called small world networks, which depend upon bridging ties between clusters. Nonetheless, there are entrepreneurial strategies through which new ventures might achieve the advantages of small world networks. To the extent that new ventures emerge in truncated scale free networks, their founders must work within a highly centralized structure, with its institutionalized standards making team formation and entrepreneurial search more instrumental than within small worlds.

In contrast, sharing personal advice improved work quality and signaled competence, but did not save time. Beyond the content of the knowledge, process costs in the form of document rework and lack of advisor effort negatively affected task outcomes.

This paper considers the development of business relationships in terms of the continuing co-evolution of trust and information exchange and the issues associated with researching these processes. The interconnections of trust and information exchange are examined in a survey of business relationships involving information exchange (n=355). Analysis of variance shows few, if any, of the aspects of the standard conceptualizations of information exchange are associalted with increased levels of trust. It is information exchange norms that have the greatest (positive) association with the level of trust. These norms emerge as part of the long term co-production of the relationship itself. This has important managerial implications. We conclude there are few managerial actions involving managing communication that can ""manufacture"" trust and improve or develop relationships in the short term.

We then test interaction hypotheses on the marginal benefits of cohesion, when collaborators have independent ties between themselves that do not include the individual. We identify the moderators of brokerage and argue for contingent benefits, based on the interaction of structure with the attributes, career experiences, and extended networks of individuals and their collaborators. Using a social definition of creative success, we also trace the development of creative ideas from their generation through future use by others. We test the hypothesis that brokered ideas are less likely to be used in future creative efforts.

In this paper, we argue that interpersonal similarity is one key driver behind knowledge sharing within the MNC context. We focus on the similarity of the national-cultural background, shared language, and similarity of organizational status as factors generating homophily. We suggest that such similarity leads to a higher tendency for interaction, increasing the sharing of business knowledge, and driving an aggregate effect of clustering. Based on a synthesis of the literature and a multiple case study of three multinationals, we argue that knowledge flows better within clusters driven by hornophily than between them, creating a paradox of homophily.

Frequently, ideas and information are dispersed over globally distributed organizations or team members. As a result, the exchange of knowledge has become not only very important for innovation but also highly complex. To facilitate this knowledge exchange, electronically mediated interactions are growing rapidly, replacing traditional face-to-face communications. However, literature provides contradicting results regarding the effectiveness of computer-mediated communication (CMC) versus face-to-face communication. This study attempts to reconcile differences in the literature on the benefits of CMC technologies and co-location. Focusing on knowledge dissemination in technology development processes in high-technology firms, the study investigates the relative impact of CMC technologies and co-location of research and development (R&D) staff, as well as the mutual interaction between them. The present article hypothesizes that CMC technologies and co-location of R&D staff have a positive impact on knowledge dissemination. Further, it is hypothesized that it is more favorable to co-locate R&D staff than to invest in CMC technologies and that the effects of co-location and CMC interact negatively. These hypotheses are tested using empirical data collected from 277 high-technology firms in the United States, and the results are generalized by conducting the same test on data from 125 high-technology firms in the Netherlands. Tests are conducted in a real-world setting, differing from previous comparative studies that mainly used laboratory experiments. Empirical results support the main effects of CMC technologies and co-location of R&D staff on knowledge dissemination. Other empirical results contradict conventional wisdom. Investing in CMC technologies is found to be favorable over co-locating R&D staff for knowledge dissemination. Moreover, the two communication channels strengthen each other. The discussion section presents the contours of a firm-level theory on communication infrastructures and knowledge dissemination, focusing on the scope and the heterogeneity of knowledge dissemination, which may explain these initially surprising results. From the arguments it follows that the choice for investment in eo-location or CMC technologies depends on the scope of knowledge dissemination that has to be facilitated. Furthermore, the conclusion is made that effective knowledge dissemination requires a balanced investment in co-location and information technologies to be able to deal with the heterogeneous but interdependent types of knowledge dissemination.",,,,,"Berends, Hans/0000-0002-3334-2926",,,,,,,,,,,,0737-6782,,,,,JAN,2007,24,1,,,,,52,68,,10.1111/j.1540-5885.2006.00232.x,,,,,,,WOS:000242835400005,,,,,

J,"Tiwana, A; Bush, AA",,,,"Tiwana, A; Bush, AA",,,Continuance in expertise-sharing networks: A social perspective,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"As engineering firms, R&D groups, and technical organizations recognize the centrality of their engineers' expertise to their performance, they are widely investing in knowledge management (KM) initiatives. Contemporary KM initiatives increasingly include expertise-sharing networks that help answer questions about who knows what. These systems allow organizations to locate and leverage the specialized engineering and technical expertise that is held in the minds of dispersed individuals. However, stories of such expertise-sharing networks that languish from under-use and abandonment abound and the issue of continuance has received very little attention in prior research. In this paper, we explore this understudied issue. We develop a model of expertise-sharing network system continuance through a four-year observational study of 418 users of two such systems and then empirically test it using multiperiod data collected from 122 users of four such systems. The concept of irretrievable investments was used to guide theoretical development in the initial observational phase of the study. The study makes several unique theoretical contributions. First, it develops a model that illustrates how irretrievable postadoption investments (sunk costs) by individual users of expertise-network systems increase continuance. We empirically show that the model explains approximately half of the total variance in continuance intention. This model advances continuance beyond the traditional expectation-satisfaction model of initial adoption to more advanced postadoption stages of use and theoretically incorporates the network-specificity aspect of postadoption investments in explaining continuance. Specifically, we show that individual users': 1) reputation among peer users of a system increases continuance; 2) system-mediated relationships with other users of the system increase continuance; and 3) investments in personalization of a system initially diminish continuance. Another notable contribution is the development and validation of several new measures for expertise-sharing network constructs.",,,,"Wang, Charles/B-5565-2011","Wang, Charles/0000-0001-9331-8437",,,,,,,,,,,,0018-9391,,,,,FEB,2005,52,1,,,,,85,101,,10.1109/TEM.2004.839956,,,,,,,WOS:000226570500007,,,,,

Using social network theory, the authors investigate buyers' preferences for specific patterns of relationships among buyers, intermediary vendors, and suppliers of complex products. Using a conjoint experiment with actual and prospective buyers of integrated computer networks and services, the authors find that beyond their dyadic interaction with a vendor, buyers take into account the buyer-vendor-supplier triad. Specifically, buyers value sequences of selective strong ties as well as sequences of more numerous weak ties. This is consistent with theoretical propositions that strong ties facilitate the mobilization of support and the transfer of complex knowledge, whereas nonoverlapping weak ties facilitate the gathering of intelligence and the monitoring of new developments. The authors find only mixed evidence that buyers value direct access to suppliers when strong ties exist between the vendor and suppliers, as predicted by the third-party sanctioning argument in social network theory. In addition, they find that interaction intensity and valence do not always have the same effects, thus providing criterion validation to the bidimensional nature of tie strength that has been documented in previous research.",,,,"Wuyts, Stefan/K-6490-2012; Franses, Philip Hans/D-4398-2009; Van den Bulte, Christophe/P-4046-2014","Van den Bulte, Christophe/0000-0001-9708-1596",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-2437,1547-7193,,,,NOV,2004,41,4,,,,,479,487,,10.1509/jmkr.41.4.479.47015,,,,,,,WOS:000225346900013,,,,,

Based on case study research, we identify that Firms are using relations for a variety of purposes and that every firm has an individual relational mix. This relational mix changes with the development of the firms. While the relative importance of social and reputational networks decrease with the firms' development, co-opetition networks increase over time. Knowledge and innovation networks are a function of reputation and management capacity while the development of marketing networks depends on the firm's culture and management style. Both weak ties and strong tics are important for the growth of the firm since they fulfil different functions. Firm growth is determined by path-dependent relational capability that eventually reaches its limits and leads to the reconfiguration of a rather stable network.

Moreover as marketers are getting more interested in harnessing the power of w-o-m, for e-business and other not related activities, the effects of the different communications types on macro level marketing is becoming critical. In particular we are interested in the breakdown of the personal communication between closer and stronger communications that are within an individual's own personal group (strong tics) and weaker and less personal communications that an individual makes with a wide set of other acquaintances and colleagues (weak ties). We use a technique borrowed from Complex Systems Analysis called stochastic cellular automata in order to generate data and analyze the results so that answers to our main research issues could be ascertained. The following summarizes the impact of strong and weak ties on the speed of acceptance of a new product: The influence of weak tics is at least as strong as the influence of strong ties. Despite the relative inferiority of the weak tic parameter in the model's assumptions, their effect approximates or exceeds that of strong ties, in all stages of the product life cycle. External marketing efforts (e.g., advertising) are effective. However, beyond a relatively early stage of the growth cycle of the new product, their efficacy quickly diminishes and strong and weak ties become the main forces propelling growth, The results clearly indicate that information dissemination is dominated by both weak and strong w-o-m, rather than by advertising. The effect of strong ties diminishes as personal network size decreases. Market attributes were also found to mediate the effects of weak and strong ties. When personal networks are small, weak ties were found to have a stronger impact on information dissemination than strong ties.",,,,"Muller, Eitan/A-9310-2008","Muller, Eitan/0000-0002-8180-7484",,,,,,,,,,,,0923-0645,,,,,AUG,2001,12,3,,,,,211,223,,10.1023/A:1011122126881,,,,,,,WOS:000172764800001,,,,,

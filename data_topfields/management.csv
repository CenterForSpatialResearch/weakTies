In particular, using original data from the corporate R&D laboratory of a global pharmaceutical company, we evaluate how a specific structural arrangement (i.e., belonging to a clique) affects inventors' innovative productivity. Our results show that both instrumental/knowledge-sharing cliques and affective/friendship cliques correlate positively with inventors' innovative productivity. However, we also observe that when inventors straddle knowledge-sharing and friendship cliques, their innovative productivity declines. Managerial Summary Firms competing in knowledge-intensive industries rely on the productivity of their inventors to develop innovations. Within these firms, inventors' innovative productivity is influenced by the people they interact with and by the benefits and costs associated with maintaining these relationships. We find that inventors' innovative productivity is enhanced by having strong and embedded relationships with their colleagues, regardless of these relationships being based on knowledge-sharing ties or friendship ties.

This paper aims to concentrate on the role of tacit knowledge sharing in fostering innovation capability of an organization. Specifically, the study considers social capital (relational, cognitive and structural) as an important precursors to tacit knowledge sharing, which in turn, influences innovation capability of an organization. The study further discusses the role that knowledge reciprocation plays in successful tacit knowledge sharing. The relation between knowledge quality and innovation capability is also discussed in the paper. Design/methodology/approach The investigation started with a review of extant literature in the field of knowledge sharing and innovation to derive a set of constructs. A set of hypotheses was developed based on the identified constructs, which was subsequently validated through a primary survey based on a structured questionnaire on a sample size of 190 respondents from the Indian industrial domain. The survey responses were subsequently analysed using the statistical technique of structural equation modeling and conclusions were drawn from the findings. Additionally, careful attention was paid in eliminating the common method bias, which is often associated with a primary survey. Findings A set of six hypotheses were derived based on the identified constructs and were subsequently validated. While validating the hypotheses, it was observed that while knowledge reciprocity, relational social capital and cognitive social capital was positive associated with tacit knowledge sharing, structural social capital did not have a significant effect on the same. Additionally, it was also observed that both tacit knowledge sharing and the quality of knowledge were positively associated with innovation capability. Originality/value Although there is a growing body of literature concerning the role of knowledge management in innovation, there still a dearth in discussing the role of tacit knowledge sharing in exploiting the innovation capability of an organization.

This article addresses the trade-off between knowledge diversity, that is, approaching the most relevant individual to maximize the likelihood that he/she possesses diverse knowledge and the ability to access, that is, recognize and assimilate this knowledge. We examine this trade-off in relation to managers in subsidiaries of multinational corporations (MNCs) and two types of diverse knowledge-novel knowledge and specialist expertise. We use a network mobilization perspective and arguments on network range within and across organizational boundaries, testing our hypotheses on a dataset of 838 ties from 120 managers leading problem-solving projects. Our study offers implications for the knowledge-based view of the MNC as well as the problem-solving perspective in strategy. Managerial Summary: We examine where managers in subsidiaries of multinational corporations (MNCs) access diverse knowledge to solve nonroutine problems. This is underpinned by a trade-off. To increase chances that the other person holds diverse knowledge, they may reach far in terms of approaching an individual in a different work context; but such far reach diminishes their ability to integrate this knowledge. We resolve this trade-off. We find that approaching individuals from an MNC unit in another country location but from the same function increases the likelihood of accessing novel knowledge; whereas accessing specialist expertise is more likely achieved by approaching an MNC colleague from another function located in another country and someone working for an external organization.

To approach this phenomenon, the theoretical frame of reference is based on the industrial network approach to industrial markets separating developing, producing and using settings. The business network settings are combined with networking behaviours consisting of both strong and weak ties. Importantly, for a start-up to become embedded through networking, resources of the start-up need to be combined with resources in the three business network settings. The paper relies on a case study methodology focusing on a start-up, founded at a technical university in Sweden, and its networking behaviours. The paper concludes that networking behaviours relying on strong ties are crucial to resource combining.

While prior research has advanced the understanding of how factors around tie strength, resource mobilization, and environmental characteristics relate to new product development, it has yet to offer a more holistic understanding of the interconnected structures and the interplay among these factors. Furthermore, limited insights exist about how firms could utilize resource mobilization approaches in different environmental contexts to enhance new product success. Building on resource dependence theory, this paper contributes to prior work by adopting configuration theoretical considerations and performing an empirical investigation to identify necessary and sufficient conditions for new product success. Based on data from a survey of 354 managers from manufacturing and services firms in the United Kingdom, the study conducts a configurational comparative study based on fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to examine configurations of strong-tie and weak-tie resource mobilization approaches within particular environmental contexts for new product success. The findings reveal alternative, equifinal configurations for new product success, and add to the existing body of work by connecting the notions of network ties, resource mobilization, and context dependence, as well as by developing an integrative framework to explain the interplay of remote and proximate conditions for new product success.

Design/methodology/approach This longitudinal qualitative study deployed semi-structured interviews with nine owner-managers, each being interviewed three or four times. Analytical procedures were used with an established framework, which conceptualised four key personal resources for resilience, as follows: adaptability, confidence, social support and purposefulness. Findings There were four key findings, as follows: owner-manager adaptability can appear in extremes including a sense of helplessness or optimism where disruptive circumstances are not sensed as problematic; owner-manager confidence levels often echo their own mindset of adaptability, that is, from helplessness to positive ambition; owner-managers can use discursive tactics with strong/weak ties for a range of affective and technical resources for resilience; and purposefulness tended to be framed in terms of a necessity for a longer term future state related to own or family lifestyle rather than profit. It is also noted that the owner-manager and the firm are closely interrelated, and therefore, enhancement of personal resilience resources is likely to positively influence their resilience, and therefore, the resilience of the organisation and strategic capability of the firm.

Several studies have shown that heterogeneous groups are superior to homogeneous groups when novel or creative solutions need to be developed to deal with tasks characterized by high task uncertainty. For boundary spanners in engineering project groups, it is proposed that cross-departmental technical advice links are another source of the information needed to deal with task uncertainty.

In this study, I propose that in markets where competitors are a set of key stakeholders, knowledge sharing is a strategic response to high levels of buy-in uncertainty related to a potential opportunity, namely, the likelihood that stakeholders will come to realize the value of a potential opportunity in a timely fashion. Using a unique data set of knowledge sharing among investment professionals on a digital platform, this study leverages variation in the platform's knowledge-sharing structure to test this theory.

It investigates the impact of online referral reward programs on receivers' responses from the perspectives of social norms and market norms. We identify the moderating conditions that are expected to affect when and how a reward leads the receiver to infer social norms, thereby increasing the referral's effectiveness. In study 1, because receivers with different tie may have relationships based on market norms or social norms (Wentzel et al. in J Serv Res 17(2):119-133, 2014), we examine the effect of tie strength and reward allocation on receivers' responses in online referral reward programs.

In study 2, we introduced brand relationships to analyze the effect of tie strength and reward allocation on receivers' responses. In study 3, we studied the effects of reward type and tie strength on receivers' responses in online referral reward programs. To capture the underlying process, we also examined the participants' perceptions of social cost in three studies. Finally, we conclude by discussing the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings. People with strong ties tended to accept a referral more often than those with weak ties, because people with strong ties gave their friends' benefits more consideration. However, in strong brand relationships, receivers with strong ties in No Reward conditions tend to respond to referrals more than those with strong ties in the Reward Recommender conditions, because rewarding recommenders makes social norms transfer into market norms.

Thus, the number of online connections-especially weak-has increased significantly. In this paper, we first examine whether an individual's social network plays a role in driving job search behavior, taking into account online social networking sites (e.g., Linkedln) and other job search modes. Second, we examine how ties in online social networks (both weak and strong) affect job search outcomes (modeled sequentially as job leads, interviews, and offers), and we compare the findings to job outcomes from traditional job search modes (e.g., career fairs, newspaper, Internet postings, and friends and family). To do so, we first construct an economic model of search behavior incorporating cost and benefit functions; we then estimate the model to recover structural parameters using the survey data of 424 users. Our findings show that users are spending more time searching for jobs on social networking sites.

We argue that 3 complementary conditions influence dyadic expertise use in teams: A focal team member is more likely to use a peer's expertise in a specific domain when the peer is perceived to have valuable expertise (opportunity), when the member is psychologically empowered (motivation), and when the member shares a strong tie with the peer (ability).

Using survey data on communication networks at a software company, we find that people with highly constrained networks generate good ideas by following a logic of interrogation, by which they focus their attention on information from a particular contact. Conversely, individuals with less constrained networks produce good ideas by following a logic of recombination, whereby they divide their attention to information coming from across multiple contacts. The results show that in highly constrained networks, interrogation is a more reliable pathway to good ideas than recombination. We discuss the implications of these findings for behavioral strategy, social networks, and innovation. Managerial Summary: People can develop good ideas when they recombine diverse information inputs shared by non-redundant communication partners that span multiple local clusters. But, in an organization, most individuals are embedded in constrained networks of people who know each other and thus typically receive redundant information from work colleagues.

Moreover, the knowledge based view (KBV) has long suggested that due to stronger cognitive links within firms, internal compared to external service provision creates better conditions for knowledge sharing. Empirical evidence for this claim is however scarce, and the KBV does not explain the mechanisms for more knowledge sharing in internal sourcing in detail. Moreover, there is now some evidence to suggest that firms' relationships with external sourcing partners are becoming more similar to those with captive centres, which represent a less traditional form of insourcing setting. To scrutinize the possible knowledge sharing advantages of internal sourcing in more depth, we turn to social capital (SC) research. There are some theoretical claims that SC and knowledge sharing are stronger within than between firms, and there is ample evidence that SC facilitates knowledge sharing. Our survey results suggest that the extent of knowledge sharing and SC are indeed stronger in a captive than in an external sourcing mode, and that structural (tie strength), cognitive (shared understanding), and relational (trust) aspects of SC mediate the effect of sourcing mode on the extent of knowledge sharing. By contrast, network stability (a structural aspect) mediated knowledge sharing only indirectly, by reinforcing the other SC aspects.

The analysis of full network data (N = 211) collected from a multinational high-tech organization demonstrated that (a) geographical diversity was negatively associated with expertise awareness and knowledge sharing, (b) functional diversity was negatively related to expertise awareness, (c) hierarchical diversity had a positive effect on knowledge acquisition and expertise awareness, and (d) emotionally close ties contributed to expertise awareness and knowledge sharing. The findings indicate that hierarchical diversity and emotional closeness can promote knowledge sharing when members face new demands in the midst of organizational change.",,,,,"Kim, Heewon/0000-0002-1341-8962",,,,,,,,,,,,0893-3189,1552-6798,,,,FEB,2018,32,1,,,,,5,30,,10.1177/0893318917728340,,,,,,,WOS:000419043700001,,,,,B,"Gausdal, AH",,"Das, TK",,"Gausdal, Anne H.",,,MANAGING TRUST -BUILDING IN PUBLIC-PRIVATE STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,MANAGING TRUST IN STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,Research in Strategic Alliances,,,,,,,,,,,"Building interpartner trust in strategic alliances is one of the key challenges in managing such alliances in general and, because of different goals, governance systems, logics and language, in public-private alliances in particular. Interpartner trust develops through the mechanisms of trust transfer and trust conversion, and managing both is an important management issue. The research question to be answered in this chapter is, How to manage trust building processes and methods in public-private strategic alliances? The five processes of connection, communication, direction, temporary groups, and resource-sharing are found to build trust in interpartner contexts. Moreover, the processes of connection, communication, and temporary groups are found to contribute to the mechanism of mist transfer, while the process of direction appears to contribute to the mechanism of trust conversion. Although the process of resource-sharing is found to contribute mostly to the mechanism of trust transfer, when the managers get their employees to share resources with their alliance partners, this process may also contribute to trust conversion. Moreover, managing these processes consciously constitutes top down processes that contribute to trust conversion. This chapter discusses in depth these five trust-building processes both theoretically and practically, and develops an outline of how the processes might be managed in practice. Furthermore, several methods or tools that entail one or more of the trust building processes are presented; and four cases from public private settings further illustrate how the processes and methods can be used, or not used, in practice. The findings show that applying and managing the trust-building processes and methods has a positive influence on trust-building in public private alliances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-64113-530-6; 978-1-64113-531-3,,,,2018,,,,,,,273,296,,,,,,,,,WOS:000479283400010,,,,,J,"Parnell, D; Widdop, P; Groom, R; Bond, A",,,,"Parnell, Daniel; Widdop, Paul; Groom, Ryan; Bond, Alex",,,The emergence of the sporting director role in football and the potential of social network theory in future research,MANAGING SPORT AND LEISURE,,,,,,,,,,,,"The commodified and highly competitive nature of professional football (soccer) has increased the professionalisation of organisational structures and management practices within clubs that enhance their competitive advantages within the labour market. This is a direct result of the financial rewards for success, and the potential cost of failure is significant. The utilisation of the Sporting Director position represents one strategy for organisations to improve both on and off-field performance success through maintaining organisational influence and control. Yet, the role is accompanied by a range of conceptual and operational misunderstandings. This commentary aims to examine the emergence of the Sporting Director and to offer some guidance on potential avenues for future research. Specifically, we consider, how social network theory might provide a theoretical framework to understand the role of the Sporting Director in practice better. To achieve this, this commentary is structured into five sections. First, we outline the role of corporate governance, senior executives and board membership, within organisational studies and the applicability of this for professional football. Second, we offer a contextual analysis of the business of professional football in Europe, and in particular its move towards globalisation and commodification. Third, we provide a current review of the Sporting Director role in professional football. Fourth, we explain the value of thinking relationally, using a social network approach, to better understanding the role of the Sporting Director within the global context.

Thus, this study aims to characterize the academic production about the subject interorganizational networks available in national journals with Concept ""A"" (Qualis Capes), in the period between 2006 and 2016. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses national journals with Concept ""A"" of the Qualis classification (2016) for journal selection. In total, 12 ""A"" concept journals were identified. However, it was decided to analyze ten of them. The procedures suggested by Crossan and Apaydin (2010) for conducting bibliometric studies were adopted. It has been identified that 77 articles were published in eight journals. The R 3.3.2 and R Studio 1.0.136 software were used. The IGRAPH 0.5.5-2 extension (package) was used to analyze graphs and co-authorship networks (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006). This extension is able to manipulate networks with millions of vertices and edges and provides a series of functions to analyze the properties of social networks, such as subnetworks, intermediation, centrality, among other characteristics (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006). Correspondence analysis (CA) was also performed. CA is a multivariate exploratory technique that converts a data matrix into a graphical representation, so that rows and columns are represented by points in a graph (Greenacre and Hastie, 1987). This extension is dedicated to the multivariate analysis of data and allows the manipulation of different types of variables (quantitative or categorical). In the present research, multiple CA (MCA) was applied - indicated when the elements are described as categorical variables (Le et al., 2008). The characteristics considered for carrying out MCA were the ""main term"", ""research approach"", ""type of research"", ""constructs"" and ""research strategies"". By using the FactoMineR 1.34 extension, the hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC) function was used (Husson et al., 2007; Le et al., 2008). This function allows creating clusters from the characteristics of the articles analyzed and highlights the justifications for the groupings created. The function allows forming as many clusters the researcher wishes, being of its attribution to analyze a division that best represents the characteristics of the data (Husson, Josse, and Pages, 2010). Husson et al. (2010) suggest that an analysis should be performed from the hierarchical tree, thus the number of clusters can be defined considering the overall appearance (or shape) of the tree formed. At last, a word cloud was created using the Wordcloud 2.5 extension (Fellows, 2013). The noticed advantage of using this extension is that it does not separate the terms that form a keyword when generating the cloud. It has been used for the keywords of the 77 articles analyzed; however, it has been decided to keep those that presented frequency greater than or equal to two. By avoiding occasional terms, a more intelligible cloud was obtained. Findings - The present study was not able to verify if the journals analyzed by Andrighi et al. (2011) have influenced others to publish on the subject, as suggested by the Bradford's Law. The standard ""success breeds success"", suggested by the Bradford's Law, was not confirmed. The so-called nuclear zone (Brookes, 1969; Novaretti et al., 2015) is composed of the journals Brazilian Administration Review (BAR), Revista de Administracao Contemporanea (RAC), Revista de Administracao Publica (RAP) and Revista Brasileira de Gestao de Negocios (RBGN). The journal RAC stands out for having been the one that has increased its annual average of publication in relation to the theme, when compared with the findings of Andrighi et al. (2011). The journals BAR and RBGN stand out because they are in the nuclear zone, even though they were not considered in the work of Andrighi et al. (2011). It should be noted that all the analyzed journals have in common the fact of addressing the themes of management and administration and, more specifically, making room for the ""competitiveness"" and ""cooperation"" constructs. These constructs are related to the theme of networks and were the most recurrent in the articles analyzed. ""Cooperation"" (29), ""competitiveness"" (27), ""knowledge"" (12), ""learning"" (6) and ""trust"" (3) were the ""constructs"" used to compose the 77 articles analyzed. In turn, ""network"" (49), ""alliance"" (18) and ""cluster"" (9) were the ""main term"" most used in the articles. This implies that the topic of cooperation is more linked to a vision of strategy. As occurred in the research of Andrighi et al. (2011), the term ""network"" is the most recurrent; in addition, the growth of space obtained by the term ""alliance"" stands out. The terms ""network"" and ""alliance"" were the most used by the articles, being predominant in 87 per cent of the research. In the present research, the predominance of the term ""network"" may have occurred because its concept is broader and it is used in the literature in different ways, even in contradictory ways (Andrighi et al., 2011; Schommer, 2001). In turn, the term ""alliance"" may have been recurrent because it has a wide dispersion of published issues, such as governance structure, cooperation, knowledge transfer and trust (Lima and Campos Filho, 2009). By using the HCPC function of the FactoMineR extension, the articles were grouped according to their characteristics, and then three clusters were formed. By analyzing the generated results, it is assumed that the division into three clusters was the one that best represented the data. Cluster 1 is characterized by descriptive, quantitative, half documentary and half survey research studies, being ""cluster"" the main term. Cluster 2 is characterized by exploratory case studies with qualitative-quantitative analyzes. Cluster 3 is characterized by theoretical tests. The Zipf's law points out that a small group of words occurs many times; however, when considering the most recurrent words Networks (9), Strategic Alliances (8), Cooperation (8), Interorganizational Networks (8) and Alliances (6) show that they were present in only about 10 per cent of the works. Lotka's Law, which states that few authors publish much and many authors publish little, was not confirmed. The authors who presented the highest number of publications, T. Diana L. v. A. de Macedo-Soares (6); Jorge Renato Verschoore (6); Alsones Balestrin (5); Douglas Wegner (4); Humberto Elias Garcia Lopes (4), participated in less than 10 per cent of the works. Thus, the authorship was characterized by many researchers publishing few works, what can be an effect of the behavior of these authors, who prefer to publish in network. The centrality of the relations between the authors was analyzed and, in addition, the intermediation points of the network were identified. The present study also analyzed all the references used by the 77 articles that compose the study. The main author of each of the references used was identified. Among the 30 identified authors, Yin and Hair Jr. stand out for books related to fundamentals and research methodologies. Borgatti and Eisenhardt developed research on the topic of interorganizational networks and also created works for methodological foundations. Powell was the most frequently mentioned author (28) and had more different works referenced (9). Powell stands out for the production of articles published in periodicals, not books. Porter's situation is the opposite. Most of the quotations made to the author come from his books, especially the work ""Competitive strategy"" (Porter, 1980). All authors identified are foreigners, with the exception of Balestrin. Marshall, Polanyi, Granovetter and Williamson are authors of works considered seminal, being them, respectively, ""Principles of economics"" (Marshall, 1890), ""Personal knowledge: towards a post critical philosophy"" (Polanyi, 1958) and ""The strength of weak ties"" (Granovetter, 1973) and ""Markets and hierarchies, analysis and antitrust implications"" (Williamson, 1975). Research limitations/implications - Like all research, it has limitations. The first one derives from the selection criteria of the periodicals to be analyzed. The cut referring to the journals of greater impact excludes most of the national articles. These studies may contain important contributions to the knowledge of the national publication profile. In addition, the choice to analyze the journals disregards other types of work, such as books, scientific events, dissertations and thesis and reports. The choice of articles published in journals is based on the fact that these are a ""certified knowledge"", as the studies are peer-reviewed, and in the case of the Qualis ""A"" stratum, a review of exogenous quality is supposed on this production. Despite its flaws, this system can be considered reliable to evaluate scientific knowledge (Bedeian, 2004; Shugan, 2007). The analysis of the most recent articles may have been hampered by a temporal issue. In addition, the choice of keywords, a necessary step, leaves out other studies. Another limitation refers to the fact that the articles have been analyzed and classified by the authors, which presupposes the use of their value judgments, at least to some extent. Other limitations refer to the bibliometric techniques employed. The main authors referenced in the studies were demonstrated, that is, those authors who have been used as a theoretical reference for studies of interorganizational networks. However, the circumstances under which these citations occurred were not analyzed. For example, an author may be quoted to use the contribution of his/her study, to be criticized or just to be another reference in the text. The lack of this analysis can be considered a fragility of the study. Practical implications - This text was started talking about the dispersion of the studies on networks in the country. Previous work has been used, theoretically and empirically demonstrating this fact. Zipf's Law applied to bibliometrics, as described by Guedes and Borschiver (2005), Novaretti et al. (2015) and Pao (1978), was not confirmed in this study, which seems to be an indicative fact that the research on this theme in Brazil presents fragmentation as an intrinsic characteristic. That is, it must remain fragmented, as this would be its own way to evolve. This is evident especially when comparing the study of Andrighi et al. (2011) and its results. With several but continuous temporal cut-outs, and the same keywords, the maintenance of this dispersion is evident. This is also a contribution of this study. Social implications - The study contributed to updating the research profile, mainly after the triennium 2013-2015 of Qualis Capes' evaluations. It also added to the mapping of recent Brazilian academic production related to interorganizational networks, completing studies by Alves et al. (2013), Andrighi et al. (2011), Balestrin et al. (2010), Cunha and Carrieri (2003) and Mascena et al. (2013). Thus, it is believed that the research reached the proposed objectives, despite its limitations. Originality/value - The present research is also justified by helping to understand the subject being useful for researchers, educators and students, in general, in the task of demonstrating gaps and opportunities of future researches and collaborating with the elaboration of a research agenda (Baumgartner and Pieters, 2003). The work has updated bibliometrics on the subject and allows comparisons with previous bibliometric studies (Alves et al., 2013; Andrighi et al., 2011; Balestrin et al., 2010; Cunha and Carrieri, 2003; Ferreira et al., 2014; Lima and Campos Filho, 2009; Mascena et al., 2013). It is believed that the present study differs from the others because of the analysis performed, the way the data were treated, with techniques that are rarely used simultaneously, going beyond the descriptive statistics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2515-8961,,,,,,2018,15,1,,,,,92,115,,10.1108/INMR-02-2018-006,,,,,,,WOS:000452150900006,,,,,J,"Ma, RK; Liu, FC; Sun, YT",,,,"Ma, Rongkang; Liu, Fengchao; Sun, Yutao",,,"Collaboration partner portfolio along the growth of Chinese firms' innovation capability: configuration, evolution and pattern",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper examines R& D collaboration of Chinese firms along the growth of innovation capability from the portfolio perspective.

They also need to know how the effects of these drivers are moderated by customer characteristics (e.g. gender, age, income, country). The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - To investigate these issues a built a large-scale multi-national database was created that includes attitudinal drivers, customer characteristics, and a full range of WOM behaviors, involving both the sending and receiving of both positive and negative WOM, with both strong and weak ties. The combination of sending-receiving, positive-negative and strong ties-weak ties results in a typology of eight distinct WOM behaviors. The investigation explores the drivers of those behaviors, and their moderators, using a hierarchical Bayes model in which all WOM behaviors are simultaneously modeled. Findings - Among the many important findings uncovered are: the most effective way to drive all positive WOM behaviors is through maximizing affective commitment and positive emotions; minimizing negative emotions and ensuring that customers are satisfied lowers all negative WOM behaviors; all other attitudinal drivers have lower or even mixed effects on the different WOM behaviors; and customer characteristics can have a surprisingly large impact on how attitudes affect different WOM behaviors. Practical implications - These findings have important managerial implications for promotion (which attitudes should be stimulated to produce the desired WOM behavior) and segmentation (how should marketing efforts change, based on segments defined by customer characteristics). Originality/value - This research points to the myriad of factors that enhance positive and reduce negative word-of-mouth, and the importance of accounting for customer heterogeneity in assessing the likely impact of attitudinal drivers on word-of-mouth behaviors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1757-5818,1757-5826,,,,,2018,29,1,,,,,2,38,,10.1108/JOSM-03-2017-0077,,,,,,,WOS:000427788800001,,,,,J,"Kim, YC; Rhee, M",,,,"Kim, Young-Choon; Rhee, Mooweon",,,Professional collaboration in technological innovation: a case of technology licensing of university inventions,TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"Technological innovation, as a collaboration among inventors and complementary knowledge professionals, requires the management of knowledge boundaries and the integration of specialised tasks.

Specifically, it considers social capital (i.e., the result of a firm's inter-organizational relationships) as an essential precursor of knowledge identification capabilities and deliberated knowledge acquisition strategies. This study aims to propose that cognitive and relational dimensions of a firm's inter-organizational social capital are mediating factors of the relationship between structural social capital and knowledge identification capabilities and the relationship between structural social capital and the deliberated acquisition of external knowledge, respectively. The relationship between knowledge identification capability and external knowledge acquisition is also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach This is a cross-sectional quantitative study with a sample of 87 firms from Spanish biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. From an extensive literature review, we developed three hypotheses that were tested using the partial least squares technique and structural equations model. Findings The results only support a mediating effect of cognitive social capital in the relationship between structural social capital and knowledge identification capability and a partial mediation effect of relational social capital in the relationship between structural social capital and knowledge acquisition. In addition, the findings show that firms with more advanced abilities to identify and assess the value of external knowledge will be likely to develop optimal deliberated strategies to acquire effectively such knowledge from its network partners. Research limitations/implications The limitations of this study are small sample size and the cross-sectional nature of the study. The study also focuses on only two specific and innovative industries. Practical implications Managers should understand that good management of inter-organizational social capital allows the firm to develop dynamic capabilities for the identification and acquisition of valuable knowledge. The results of the study show that managers should concentrate on building knowledge identification capabilities and should also be aware of the possibilities that social capital can provide to a firm to formulate and implement effective strategies for external knowledge acquisition. Originality/value To date, there are relatively few studies focussing on knowledge identification capability and its relationships with the dimensions of a company's social capital as enablers of external knowledge acquisition. For managers, the identification of valuable knowledge by using inter-organizational relationships and networks is an essential issue, especially in innovative industries characterized by continuous change. Theoretically, this research highlights that social capital contributes to the development of dynamic capabilities, allowing the firm to sense and seize business opportunities based on external knowledge acquisition to achieve competitive advantages.",,,,"Donate, Mario J./L-5328-2014","Donate, Mario J./0000-0003-4087-2535",,,,,,,,,,,,1367-3270,1758-7484,,,,,2018,22,6,,,,,1332,1357,,10.1108/JKM-04-2017-0131,,,,,,,WOS:000438049900007,,,,,J,"Huang, C; Wang, Y",,,,"Huang, Chun; Wang, Yan",,,"Evolution of network relations, enterprise learning, and cluster innovation networks: the case of the Yuyao plastics industry cluster",TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"Industrial clusters have become a crucial carrier of economic globalisation.

Drawing on a meta-analytical approach, we synthesize the results of 102 empirical studies to test whether network characteristics such as centrality, brokerage, and tie strength similarly influence the job performance of individuals and groups. Results show that while there are no differences in the direction of the network-performance relationship across levels, there are substantial differences in magnitude. Individual performance profits more strongly from a high number of direct connections, whereas groups reap higher benefits from brokerage positions. Additional analyses reveal that the network measurement method, tie content, and performance criteria function as moderators of the network performance relationship, but their influence is consistent neither across network characteristics nor across levels.

As such, given the enormous time and investment required for students to pursue an MBA and the role of electives in forming the student's knowledge base, it is important to consider the decision process of students while selecting elective courses as they pursue their degree. Design/methodology/approach - This study explores the relevance of network characteristics in the elective selection phenomena through questionnaires administered personally to 50 MBA students from a premier b-school in India. Thereby, it seeks to link the implications with MBA efficacy. Findings - In the sample, the authors found that social network connections in terms of homophily and heterophily (similar and dissimilar others) had the strongest association with elective course decisions. Further, the role of tie strength (the level of intensity of the social relationship between two individuals) in governing the phenomena was not confirmed. Practical implications - The authors discuss the linkage of elective selection phenomena with the efficacy of MBA. Specifically, the authors focus on a possible risk where network influences may prompt a student to select electives by surpassing his or her academic interests and thereby may hamper the efficacy. The authors also outline implications from the perspective of students, professors, and administrators.

Competing hypotheses are developed for the nature of strategic networks in the discovery and creation opportunity contexts. The results from our two studies (using PSED II dataset and data collected from women entrepreneurs in India) show that entrepreneurial strategic networks differ based on whether entrepreneurs are pursuing discovery or creation opportunities, i.e., entrepreneurs operating in 'discovery' contexts tend to use networks ties with individuals who are relatively similar to themselves, while entrepreneurs in 'creation' contexts tend to use network ties with individuals who are relatively different from themselves. Further, the results also show that the diversity in strategic networks is not unidirectional in discovery and/or creation contexts but varies depending on the specific matters for which the entrepreneur seeks advice.

We employ the Investment Game, a well-established economic game designed to generate a quantifiable trust measure. We consider the relationship between observed trust and three ""revealed preference"" tie strength measures: (1) the degree of interaction between friends on their walls; (2) embeddedness, a metric related to the number of mutual friends shared; and (3) being tagged together in a photograph, indicative of a physical-world interaction. We identify latent heterogeneity among our subjects, establishing that for users with a large number of Facebook friends, the only measure associated with trust is whether the dyad was tagged in a photo together. In contrast, for users that are more selective and have fewer Facebook friends, all three aforementioned tie strength measures correlate with trust. Our findings are preliminary evidence that traditional measures of dyadic trust like embeddedness which are used widely in physical-world social networks may not always be effective predictors of digital trust, because not all online social ties are created equal.

We conceptualize four phases of the journey of an idea, from conception to completion: idea generation, idea elaboration, idea championing, and idea implementation. We propose that a creator has distinct primary needs in each phase: cognitive flexibility, support, influence, and shared vision, respectively. Individual creators successfully move through a phase when the relational and structural elements of their networks match the distinct needs of the phase. The relational and structural elements that are beneficial for one phase, however, are detrimental for another. We propose that in order to solve this seeming contradiction and the associated paradoxes, individual creators have to change interpretations and frames throughout the different phases.

Much of project knowledge is tacit, residing in social interactions in team relationships, and likely to be disseminated through social networks and processes within organisations. Social capital comprises both the network of strong personal relationships and the knowledge resources that may be mobilised through that network. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of ""networks"" in disseminating project knowledge within the construction organisations in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach - The case study research method was used to investigate the research problem. The principal data collection technique used was semi-structured interviews. Content analysis, tables and cognitive maps were used to analyse data. Findings - The findings revealed that strong network ties created with equal interaction of project and head office (H/O) individuals, frequent connectivity and much closer relationships enhance the flexibility of sharing project knowledge. The available invisible informal social networks within project and H/O individuals play a key role in disseminating project knowledge compared to business networks.

In particular, the authors aim to answer the following research questions: how do dyadic and network relationships contribute to inter-organizational creation and transfer of knowledge? More specifically, which joint activities between organizations facilitate inter-organizational learning within a knowledge network? That is, the authors are interested in the relationship processes for inter-organisational learning, aiming to identify and understand the joint activities through which organizations within an institutional network generate and transfer knowledge. Design/methodology/approach - Aiming at studying how six institutional actors generate and transfer knowledge, the existing dyadic relationships between a focal actor (a technological center of the textile and clothing industry - CITEVE) and each one of the other five institutional actors were studied. In the study of this knowledge network the authors analyzed several documental sources and carried out 19 interviews. Findings - This study shows how dyadic and network relationships contribute to inter-organisational creation and transfer of knowledge. It assesses several joint activities through which organizations in the studied network learn with each other and compares the five dyadic relationships in terms of their distinctive features. Through the cooperative effort based on joint activities between actors, the studied network generates complementary and multidisciplinary knowledge aiming to promote network learning of the studied organizations. Management implications and suggestions for further research on network learning are discussed. Originality/value - This paper adds to the literature on network learning and management by empirically illustrating how a network of organizations in a given industry contributes to knowledge generation. It is an original contribution because, first, it allows a better understanding of how organizations of a knowledge network interact and contribute for network learning.

Design/methodology/approach - Networks are considered a potential source of learning, namely, the cognitive process of acquiring and structuring knowledge, creating meaning from experience and generating new solutions from existing knowledge. Through networks, entrepreneur share information and discuss opportunities and problems. Using an innovative approach combining story telling and network mapping, this study analyses how entrepreneurs use networks in learning. The data collected from six entrepreneurs working in knowledge-intensive sectors enables examining the learning process ensuing from the interactions between entrepreneurs and their contacts. Findings - The findings show that entrepreneurs construct different types of networks in response to their difficulties, not in relation to products or technologies, but to learn to overcome self-crises, external threats, management and organisational issues. The findings reveal that entrepreneurs develop networks dominated by strong ties for exploitative learning and networks dominated by weak ties for explorative learning.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of breadth, depth and partner newness on product innovativeness and product competitive advantage. The authors also seek to examine the contingent effects of the appropriability regime. The authors make suggestions to academics and practitioners based on the findings. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use a structured survey instrument producing an empirical analysis of 205 NPD projects in the manufacturing sector in the UK. The authors use an ordinary least squares regression model to test hypothesised relationships between openness (breadth, depth and partner newness), product innovativeness, product competitive advantage and the appropriability regime. Findings - The authors find that each of the three dimensions of openness, depth, breadth and partner newness, have a significant but differing impact on product innovativeness. Specifically, the study indicates that breadth has a positive effect but only in the presence of a strong appropriability regime, partner newness has a direct positive effect, and depth a direct negative effect. The authors also find that product innovativeness has a positive impact on product competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications - Further research should focus on replicating the findings in other countries, search for further moderating factors, such as the stage of the NPD process, and analyse the longitudinal impact of openness within NPD projects. Practical implications - Organisations are encouraging managers to be more open in their approach to NPD. The authors' findings suggest that managers need to think about the three dimensions of openness, breadth, depth and partner newness. Their engagement with each of these dimensions depends on the desired outcomes of the innovation project and the strength of patents.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors surveyed 137 software development professionals in a large Japanese electronics firm regarding co-workers who acted as critical sources of useful knowledge and the factors that affected KT within and across internal organizational boundaries. Using regression analysis, the authors test the extent to which factors such as the characteristics of the knowledge, the characteristics of the tie, and the characteristics of the network differentially affect KT within internal organizational boundaries vs across them. Findings - The authors find that factors such as the accessibility of the knowledge source, network density, and collective teaching all help in transferring knowledge, while knowledge tacitness inhibit such transfers, but that the effect of these properties varies significantly depending on whether KT occurs across group boundaries. Originality/value - Existing research on KT within firms tends to treat all such transfers as uniform, with little difference between the dynamics of within-group transfer and between-group transfer.

Findings - The framework shows that benefits and costs of increased openness balance differently. While substantial benefits may be realized in the idea generation phase, costs may outweigh the benefits in the selection and retention phase. Practical implications - Based on the framework, implications can be drawn on how openness should be introduced in the different phases of the strategy process. Specifically the author discusses appropriate open strategy tools based on social technologies, which organizations can use to benefit from openness in the different stages.

We find that high levels of agreeableness stimulate self-perceived legitimacy towards patients and peers, whereas openness to experience solely influences physicians' self-perceived legitimacy towards patients. In addition, our results highlight the contingent effect of personality traits by underlining the role of strong ties as a moderator of the relationship between personality traits and self-perceived legitimacy. By identifying these configurations we contribute to the literature on entrepreneurship with a refined perspective of antecedents of self-perceived legitimacy.

The entrepreneurs that coordinate their relations in innovation networks are faced with a continuous tension of making the independent competitive business decisions and building trust-based relations in their social and economic networks. These tensions call for an adequate integration of individual and collective perspectives in social behaviour of business organizations. The aim of this paper - to reveal the entrepreneurial approaches to decision making and trust building/maintaining in the networked business environments. This paper integrates insights from two separate yet complementary parts of research. In the first part, we discuss the main patterns of entrepreneurial decision making, based on S. Sarasvathy's theory of effectuation, and present the findings of empirical research on entrepreneurial decision making in complex business environments (survey of expert entrepreneurs in USA and Lithuania). The survey has shown that even though respondents operate in environments of similar uncertainty, their entrepreneurial predispositions are quite different. Despite these differences, they regard partnerships and networks as the single most important instrument for managing the environmental risk and uncertainty. In the second part, we present the theoretical insights and 3-stage model of trust emergence in entrepreneurial networks and findings of empirical research that covered 109 network facilitators from 37 countries from Europe and Americas. The development of trust in network of organizations contains at least three different stages that are characterised by different level / type of trust, and respective risks calling for the managerial intervention for promoting trust on the network level. The survey has revealed the personal factors as being of key importance throughout the process of inter-organizational trust development, while social and institutional factors becoming important in the later stages of the process. There is also an international diversity with regard to the choice of mechanisms for trust development (reliance on institutions vs. reliance on dominant organizations vs. self-organization).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2049-1050,2049-1069,978-1-911218-54-8; 978-1-911218-55-5,,,,2017,,,,,,,348,355,,,,,,,,,WOS:000454449400042,,,,,J,"Urrea, G; Villa, S; Goncalves, P",,,,"Urrea, Gloria; Villa, Sebastian; Goncalves, Paulo",,,Exploratory analyses of relief and development operations using social networks,SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES,,,,,,,,,,,,"We use social networks to explore how structural factors affect humanitarian organizations' performance in relief and development operations.

Adopting a multilevel perspective, and focusing on closed teams with the presence of a clear leader, we analyze two complementary moderators of this social dilemma that are fundamental to the existence of teams: the task complexity facing the team under consideration, and the individualist versus collectivist shared value orientation of its members.

However, it can be a real challenge to organize architectural innovation, all the more so when success hinges upon close collaboration with other firms that are responsible for different subsystems of the end product. This study examines the impact of product design rules and the degree of organizational coupling among innovation network partners on the performance of architectural innovation, projects. Using data from 2-70 collaborative innovation networks in the United States, we found an inversely U-shaped relationship between the presence of design rules and architectural innovation performance. When a certain turning point is reached, dominant design rules have a pronounced net negative impact on the performance of collaborative architectural innovation projects. At the same time, our findings reveal that lead firms can alleviate this negative effect of strong design rules by selecting loosely coupled innovation partners. Accordingly, our findings suggest that the presence of design rules and the extent of partner coupling should be considered jointly when optimizing network configurations that focus on architectural innovation.

In an attempt to address this, this research examines the simultaneous influence of individual and regional social capital on the discovery and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities using individual-level data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor linked with regional-level data on social capital. The results show that individuals from regions with higher social capital are more likely to discover and to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities. Moreover, individuals having networks with other entrepreneurs are also more likely to identify a business opportunity and to become an entrepreneur.

Given the powerful information dissemination capabilities, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been suggested as interventions to build infant care awareness and to modify healthcare behaviors. We examine how the use of one ICT intervention-specifically, eHealth kiosks disseminating authenticated and accessible medical information-can alleviate the problem of high infant mortality in rural India. We investigate how mothers' social networks affect their use of eHealth kiosks, seeking professional medical care for their infants and, ultimately, infant mortality. Drawing on the social epidemiology and social networks literatures, we focus on advice and hindrance from both strong and weak ties as the conduit of social influence on mothers' health-related behaviors for the care of their infants. Over a period of 7 years, we studied 4,620 infants across 10 villages where the eHealth kiosks were implemented along with support resources for proxy use. The results revealed that (1) eHealth kiosk use promotes seeking professional medical care and reduces infant mortality, (2) mothers are especially vulnerable to hindrance from both strong and weak ties as they choose to maintain the status quo of traditional infant healthcare practices (e.g., reliance on untrained personnel, superstitions, fatalism) in villages, and (3) advice from both strong and weak ties offers the potential to break down misplaced beliefs about infant healthcare practices and to develop literacy on seeking professional medical care. In contrast, in a comparative group of 10 neighboring villages, the reduction in infant mortality was not as pronounced and the effect of professional medical care in reducing infant mortality was lower. Our findings suggest that an ICT intervention can effectively address one of society's most important problems (i.e., infant mortality) even in parts of the world with limited resources and deep suspicion of technology and change.

We also argue that firms located in central positions inside the local firm-network have access to a complementary source of technical knowledge. Empirical evidence gathered from the Madrid Science Park confirms that having long-term relationships with universities, based on both formal and informal interactions, is the most important means of obtaining technical knowledge from them. We also observed a positive relationship between the technological knowledge obtained from universities and the innovation carried out by firms.

In order to pinpoint these drivers, we leverage the models of network structure dynamics elaborated within studies conducted at the intersection between network research and complexity science to propose a multilevel interpretive framework that clarifies the role and scope of intentional agency at different structural levels of interorganizational networks.

Using a panel of 1042 American scientists in five disciplines and fixed effects models, we found an inverted U-shaped relationship between network average tie strength and citation impact, because an increase in tie strength on the one hand facilitates the collaborative knowledge creation process and on the other hand decreases cognitive diversity. In addition, when the network average tie strength is high, a more skewed network performs better because it still has a ""healthy"" mixture of weak and strong ties and a balance between exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, the tie strength skewness moderates the effect of network average tie strength: both the initial positive effect and the later negative effect of an increase in tie strength are smaller in a more skewed network than in a less skewed one.

Previous literature has tended to focus on either strong ties or many weak ties with a largely unstated assumption that some degree of trade-off exists between the two (underlying trust and novel knowledge, respectively) and their relative contribution to innovation. Within the context of R&D in a SA MNC, this research provided evidence that tie breadth and tie strength are complementary in team innovation. The previously-documented tension between novelty and trust however remains present and becomes evident in the location of ties. Both strong and weak ties contribute most to innovation if they are neither too close (i.e., own team) nor too distant (i.e., outside the MNC). Instead, ties inside the greater R&D unit contributed most to innovation. This role of the location of ties suggests that studies of networks cannot remain limited to tie breadth and strength but has to be rooted in the specific context. This is consistent with prior evidence of innovation within mature and process-driven industries where an in-depth understanding of organisation knowledge is required rather than that of novel technologies.

A longitudinal case study of past debates and future directions in knowledge management for development,JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose - This paper aims to analyze how the debate around knowledge management for development has evolved over a 14-year period. Design/methodology/approach - The study was conducted in an inductive manner, seeking to identify key themes discussed on an online community on knowledge management for development. Analysis comprised observation of the online debate, as well as semantic (co-word) network analysis of a ""big data"" set, consisting of 14 years of email exchange. The results were verified with the members of the community in a focus group manner. Findings - In terms of content, the knowledge management for development debate remains strongly engaged with actual development discourse, and it continues to be rather oriented toward tools and methods. In terms of learning, the community appears highly inclusive, and provides fertile ground for in-depth knowledge sharing, but shows less potential for innovative influences. Research limitations/implications - The study contributes to literature on knowledge management in the non-profit sector by showing how heterogeneous communities in the development domain generate knowledge and shape discourse. More specifically, the paper contributes to knowledge management for development literature by providing a comprehensive overview of how the domain has evolved since its emergence. It also advances knowledge management by showing how inclusive networks can contribute to but also limit learning. Practical/implications - The study is of use to knowledge management professionals by showing not only the benefits but also the limitations of inclusive knowledge-sharing networks. Social/implications - The study provides important societal implications by showing which topics are most important to development practitioners, covering the period encompassed by the Millennium Goals.

Moreover, the moderating role of collaborative climate was investigated as protector against leaders' incivility. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed multi-level model was tested by surveying 312 health care providers nested within 42 work units at eight large hospitals in Iran. Multi-level regression analysis was used to analyze the data. Findings - The findings revealed that those team members experiencing incivility from their supervisors are more likely to show reluctance to share knowledge with team members and as a consequence this response further decreases team's creative performance. However, the climate of collaboration inside hospitals can buffer the negative impact of incivility on their readiness to share knowledge. Practical implications In team-based organizations, a supervisor's incivility can stifle the creative performance of his/her team through blocking the knowledge sharing of members. First, human resource department should have some plans to curtail incivility of supervisors. Second, establishing a climate of collaboration and trust among team members can mitigate the insidious effects of supervisors incivility. Originality/value - In prior research studies, the role of incivility on individual outcomes has been highlighted.

Business networks have been found to drive internationalization of SMEs in the Nordic context, but the impact of network-related organizational competencies on them has not been considered. Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply regression analysis on a sample of 298 Finnish SMEs across five industry sectors, gathered via an online survey in 2008, and with the data having been updated for its financial indicators up to 2010. Findings - The authors find that cross-relational network competence is a significant predictor of growth in internationally operating SMEs. This result is robust across measures among the firms. In comparison, the network competence of domestically operating SMEs is not related to their growth, and relationship-specific competence does not influence growth. Research limitations/implications - The study does not account for longitudinal aspect of competence development. Growth is measured by the growth in sales and assets, and there are other ways to measure organizational growth. A single-country context also extends some restrictions on the generalizability of the results, although they could be expected to hold across small, open economies similar to Finland and the Nordic area. Practical implications - The results imply that the strategic aims of SMEs determine their need for network competence, those SMEs seeking internationalization and growth through geographic expansion come to benefit from developing certain types of network competence. Social implications - Policy implications arise where governments in Finland and in the Nordic area may aid SMEs' internationalization efforts by enabling the growth-seeking firms with increased resources for competence development. Originality/value - This is the first study to examine how the organizational competencies to develop and manage business networks, in particular dyadic and network-level competencies, come to determine realized growth outcomes in domestic and international SMEs.

Design/methodology/approach - This study collected data in China, and 219 usable questionnaires were collected. Then, this study used a structure equation model by LISREL for hypotheses testing. Findings - This study finds that positive economic incentives, positive relational incentives and negative relational incentives all increase employees' knowledge-sharing intentions, contributing to firms' improved knowledge-transfer performance. Thus, both positive and negative incentives and both economic and relational incentives exert influences on employees' knowledge-sharing activities. Practical implications - Because employees have both material and emotional needs and always want to approach good things and avoid bad things, firms should take measures to make their incentive systems more comprehensive. Then, employees can be motivated to share their knowledge effectively. Originality/value - Existing studies have mainly explored the effects of positive economic incentives on knowledge transferal.

The purpose of this study is to examine how a firm can manage and govern supply ties to access new knowledge, from the perspective of social network. We examine the role of interorganizational interactions and network structure in enhancing knowledge flow in inbound open innovation with suppliers. Design/methodology/approach - First, A systematic literature review methodology was adopted. The research design, given that the study of open innovation is still at a nascent stage, consists of an exploratory case study to provide an in- depth analysis. We adopt semi- structured interviews to examine the role of social network in knowledge flow in supply network. Findings - The findings of this paper add to the understanding of the role of inter- organizational interaction and network structure in enhancing knowledge transfer in open innovation practices. We propose that the implementation of open innovation with suppliers requires specific supply networks based on the interactions between buyer and suppliers. Building from the SLR, we extend the idea of tie strength by Granovetter (1973), and introduce two forms of strong ties; "" vital strong ties"" and "" overembedded strong ties"", and two forms of weak ties; "" potential weak ties"" and "" infant weak ties"". We propose how overembeddedness and future interaction influence governance modes. Research limitations/implications - Although the main contribution of this paper is in extending the body of literature in open innovation research by looking at social network theories, the current propositions have to be validated by empirical analysis. A qualitative case study is currently in progress. Therefore, we cannot go forward until the results of this case study allow a general contribution to be made and increase the validity of results. Practical implications - First, the paper suggests how social network theory can enhance inflow of knowledge from suppliers in open innovation projects. Second, we extend inter- organizational relationships by adding vital strong and potential weak ties. This classification allows us to examine effective governance modes even at the early stage of innovation. We propose that the expectation of future business with weak ties constrains opportunistic behavior of suppliers and affects knowledge flow positively in open innovation. As for potential strong ties, they should not be excluded from open innovation projects since they can provide valuable knowledge to speed up the innovation process. Our argument also encourages practitioners to actively and dynamically make and maintain networks with suppliers in order to gain access to new knowledge. Originality/value - This study marks one of the first attempts to explain the role of structural and relational dimensions of social network in different inbound open innovation approaches with suppliers.

In Study 2, in a sample of 439 management consultants, we consider whether the effects of de-energizing relationships on performance may be moderated by the extent to which an individual has the psychological resource of thriving at work.

I argue that, when ambiguity increases, people will tend to (1) decrease communication with formal network ties that do not have a significant semiformal component, (2) increase communication with semiformal network ties that do not have a significant formal component, and (3) increase communication with informal network ties. Empirical support for these propositions comes from unique data-including 40 weeks of archived email metadata, the full roster of email distribution lists, personnel records, and qualitative interviews-that span the period before, during, and after an ambiguity-producing restructuring at a large information services firm.

Third parties can be either shared or unshared. Shared third parties signal insider status and have a predictable positive effect on knowledge transfer.

Surprisingly, unshared third parties have been ignored in empirical analysis, and so we do not know if or how much unshared third parties contribute to the process. Using knowledge transfer data from an online technical forum, we illustrate how unshared third parties affect the rate at which individuals initiate and sustain knowledge transfer relationships. Empirical results indicate that unshared third parties undermine knowledge sharing, and they also indicate that the magnitude of the negative unshared-third-party effect declines the more unshared third parties overlap in what they know. Our results provide a more complete view of how third parties contribute to knowledge sharing. The results also advance our understanding of network-based dynamics defined more broadly.

Yet two key research questions remain unanswered: which of a person's many dormant ties provide the most value, and which are advice seekers most inclined to choose as reconnection targets? In the current study, we asked executives to seek advice on an important work project from two dormant ties (their first, most preferred choice plus one selected randomly from their next nine most preferred choices) and to respond to surveys before and after their reconnections. This two-stage design allowed us to make causal inferences about the executives' advice-seeking preferences and the value of reconnecting certain types of dormant ties. Our results show that the most valuable reconnections are to people who provide novelty (by not having spent much time together in the past and having higher status) as well as engagement (by being trustworthy and willing to help). Our executive participants, however, preferred neither novelty nor engagement. Rather, the prospect of reconnecting can make people feel anxious. To avoid this discomfort, executives preferred contacts with whom they had spent a lot of time together in the past, thereby actually reducing novelty. Thus, our findings identify critical biases in executives' reconnection preferences as well as insights into how to make more effective reconnections.

This research explores the perceived impact of the 2011 Rugby World Cup (RWC 2011) on relationships and tie strength between Tourism Auckland (as the focal organisation) and its partner organisations. The research utilises an exploratory, qualitative case study approach. Data were collected using semi-structured pre- and post-event interviews, a formal survey and a documentation review. Emphasis was placed on comparing the intra-regional versus the inter-regional destination environment. The findings demonstrate the significant opportunities of a mega-event to strengthen existing relationships among organisations involved, and to build a valuable portfolio of both strong and weak ties. RWC 2011 positively impacted on intra-regional relationships as opposed to inter-regional relationships. A model is developed illustrating these findings. The findings can help practitioners to strategically leverage relationships, both intra- and inter-regionally. This would not only assist in attracting and delivering successful events in the future but also in creating more competitive destinations.

That is, there can be a closely tied yet adversarial relationship and an arms-length yet cooperative relationship. We theorize the buyer-supplier relationship in two orthogonal aspects(1) relational posture, that is, how two firms regard each other (as cooperative partners or as adversaries) and (2) relational intensity, that is, how much two firms' operations are interlinked (closely tied or arms-length). By considering the two aspects concurrently, this article proposes an expanded typology of buyer-supplier relationships. We label a closely tied and cooperative buyer-supplier type as deep; a closely tied but adversarial type as sticky; an arms-length and adversarial type as transient; and an arms-length but cooperative type as gracious. We then present an analysis that supports the orthogonality of the two relational dimensions.

Yet, surprising in light of the wealth of research on social networks and job attainment, we do not have a unified model of the impact of different kinds of social contacts on job search success. In this paper I show that contacts are differently beneficial for job seekers depending on the stage of the job search process that job seekers are engaged in. Specifically, three stages of the job search process can be distinguished in which social contacts fulfill different roles for the job seekers: deciding the types of jobs for which to apply, submitting job applications, and preparing for interviews. I propose that contacts who are spread across different occupations are conducive to applying to more types of jobs, yet it is contacts who are more focused across occupations that are beneficial for being invited to more interviews-relative to the number of job types applied for-and for converting the interviews into offers. In addition, contacts with lower relationship depth with the job seeker are more helpful for getting invited to interviews, whereas contacts who have more frequent interactions with the job seeker are more helpful for converting interviews into offers. Analyses using a unique longitudinal data set on the job searches of 226 participants in an MBA program offer robust evidence in support of the hypotheses.

The mediating effects of trust and norms were also found to be significant. Trust directly influences knowledge sharing, and plays a mediating role between knowledge sharing and guanxi. This suggests that knowledge sharing is likely to occur when trust exists among employees. The results further indicate that norms mediate the relationship between guanxi and knowledge sharing. Guanxi among members influences knowledge sharing; therefore, organizations require a feasible solution using the relational norms mechanism.

Both colleagues inside organizations and external parties have frequently been proposed as important sources of information and knowledge within this part of the innovation process. Other contributions addressing social networks and innovation bring into focus the potentially negative effects that certain network structures may have on innovation, pointing to inconsistencies in received theory. In order to address these inconsistencies, an empirical study of ideation in a Swedish multinational firm was performed, taking into account two different knowledge creation processes - combination and in-depth analysis - and their inter-relationships with organizational distance between contributing individuals. Data was collected using a survey and was analysed using regression models. It was found that different levels of organizational distance correlate with different knowledge creation processes. In-depth analysis occurred more often with employees' close colleagues, whereas the combination of existing ideas and information was more frequent in interaction with employees' close colleagues and with external parties. Both these interaction patterns were also found to be positive for the generation of patents, whereas no such relationship could be seen when individuals interacted with colleagues in other departments in the same firm. The findings have implications for theory on cognitive distance, and also suggest that management needs to facilitate different types of collaboration and networking when aiming to facilitate and support ideation, taking into consideration the type of innovation aimed for, as well as its supporting knowledge creation processes.",,,,,/0000-0002-6024-7908,,,,,,,,,,,,0963-1690,1467-8691,,,,MAR,2015,24,1,,,,,87,101,,10.1111/caim.12097,,,,,,,WOS:000350278600006,,,,,J,"Ren, H; Gray, B; Harrison, DA",,,,"Ren, Hong; Gray, Barbara; Harrison, David A.",,,Triggering Faultline Effects in Teams: The Importance of Bridging Friendship Ties and Breaching Animosity Ties,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"We examine the complex effects of faultlines and network ties on team performance.

SNSs have grown in both popularity and use. They allow individuals to articulate their social networks by developing a list of other members on the site with whom they share a connection. These platforms also allow companies to create profiles to promote their brands. However, many firms have jumped into SNSs by creating a ""brand page"" without fully understanding how to spread it successfully. Design/methodology/approach - Two experiments were developed. In the first one, the authors manipulated how the individual comes to know about brand pages. Participants discovered a brand page through a friend with whom they have either a strong tie or a weak tie. In the second experiment (2 x 2), the authors manipulated tie strength (strong vs weak) and the type of recommendation (active vs passive). Findings - Results of the first study show that as the individual has more experience in Facebook (measured in this paper through satisfaction, past behavior of following brands and Facebook intensity), the effect of tie strength on the intention to join a brand page dilutes. The second study confirms Study 1 and shows that strong ties exert more influence than weak ties when the brand page is actively recommended by Facebook friends. Practical implications - This paper shows that the influence of strong ties is particularly important for individuals with low levels of experience in Facebook. As experience in SNSs is expected to continue growing, managers should not forget the role of weak ties as a source of information for their networked friends. Strong ties only remain more influential than weak ties when the information about the brand page is received through an invitation.

They networked with and extensively utilised third parties, including government bodies, trade associations, government advisors, consultants and other domestic networks with international ties, in Canada and internationally to gain technical, market and internationalisation knowledge, and direct and indirect experiential knowledge which contributed to the internationalisation process confirming the study by Fletcher and Harris (2012). In a departure from the literature, this study found that weak ties (Granovetter, 1973) developed with third parties who were new to the networks allowed the NHP firms to develop competitive advantages necessary for them to overcome the liability of outsidership in entering new international markets.

In addition, the study was designed to determine the extent to which cosmopolitanism as a top management's characteristic serves as a moderator that allows top management's social capital to influence corporate marketing capabilities. Design/methodology/approach - This study's sample comprised small- and medium-sized companies in Korea and China. After excluding insincere responses, 636 questionnaires ( 329 from Koreans, 307 from Chinese) were used for the analysis. A mediated hierarchical regression analysis was performed to verify the hypothesis. Findings - This study proposed the hypothesis that top management's social capital would have positive effects on corporate marketing capabilities: pricing strategies, product development, distribution strategies and marketing communications. While managerial tie utilization and solidarity were revealed to have positive effects on corporate marketing capabilities, trust did not show statistically significant effects. Research limitations/implications - This study is subject to several limitations. First, it has not fully addressed various foundational concepts or factors that comprise or facilitate the building of social capital. In addition to trust and the sharing of core values and knowledge among organizational members, there may be other factors involved, so systematic studies should be conducted using a model that can review the roles of various explanatory variables that constitute social capital. Practical implications - This study's empirical results contribute valuable data to the literature, as it was based on a survey conducted with actual Korean and Chinese top managers. In addition, the study's findings are likely to suggest a valuable direction for evaluating corporate marketing strategies and business performance. The study identified powerful effects of top management's social capital on corporate marketing strategies. Therefore, greater investments should be made to build the top management's social capital, so that the corporate capacity for marketing strategies will be able to produce maximum effects. Social implications - The results of this study suggest the following additional points. A company with a high level of cosmopolitan orientation may have excellent strategies for competing on overseas markets. Companies targeting global markets should leverage accumulated top management's social capital to discover overseas business opportunities and acquire knowledge of overseas markets. When the corporate executives of companies that attempt to make inroads into overseas markets have such a cosmopolitan orientation and actively seek and seize overseas market opportunities, they are more likely to avoid path dependency, following domestic business activities and become successful in those global markets. Originality/value - The present study segmented social capital into sub-factors, thereby identifying their relationships with the behavioral outputs of corporate executives, such as business practice processes, marketing capabilities and business performance. Based on the findings of this study, top management's social capital should enable companies to consolidate corporate business practice capabilities and, eventually, to be seen as closely associated with business performance and the essential qualities and characteristics of top managers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1750-614X,1750-6158,,,,,2015,9,3,,,SI,,441,466,,10.1108/CMS-04-2015-0071,,,,,,,WOS:000359045900011,,,,,J,"Stensaker, IG; Gooderham, PN",,,,"Stensaker, Inger G.; Gooderham, Paul N.",,,Designing global leadership development programmes that promote social capital and knowledge sharing,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper explores the role of Global Leadership Development (GLD) programmes for developing the social capital of multinational enterprises and ultimately the enhancement of knowledge sharing across corporate divisions and national borders.

Based on Leavitt's (1965) organizational change model, 133 articles published between 2000 and 2012 from 13 journals were reviewed and analyzed. Findings - The total number of articles covering task, structure, technology and people in knowledge sharing was 49, 79, 49 and 97, respectively. Of all references, 97 articles (72 per cent) discussed the important aspects of people, and 79 articles (59 per cent) emphasized the influential role of organizational structure in knowledge sharing. The highest frequency of interactions (48 articles) was the interaction between structure and people (Interaction 5). Research limitations/implications - To capture broader phenomena on knowledge sharing in organizational change, multiple data sources and a variety of journals with a longer timeframe should be collected and a more comprehensive review should be conducted. All perspectives of organizational change were not applied to this study. Theoretically, this study attempted to illuminate how knowledge sharing has been explored through the lens of four elements in organizational change and the interactions between the elements. This study attempted to expand the use of Leavitt's (1965) model by applying interactive relationships among the elements to knowledge sharing. Practical implications - The findings can advance strategic and managerial practice by informing the planning and development of knowledge sharing associated with change in organizations. A key question is how to identify the major component of change which will trigger the other changes in the current architecture of knowledge sharing in their organizations. This study suggests that elements of structure and people, when organization face either planned or unplanned change, are critical for successful knowledge sharing by making the interactive connections with other components of change.

It focuses on a strategic alliance's first new product development (NPD) project, which is characterized by a lack of prior experience and insufficient trust between partners and explores how the interaction between (1) interorganizational learning (the degree [amount of knowledge shared] and type [tacit or explicit nature of the knowledge]); (2) the required communication (frequency level and degree of media-richness) to transfer and exchange knowledge; and (3) economic transaction considerations (reducing cost and avoiding opportunism), in highly uncertain and dynamic environments, and, in the absence of an assumption of trust, will determine the future strength of the ties between partners. We argue that the degree and type of interorganizational learning that are required to efficiently develop an alliance's first NPD project determine the strength of the ties between the partners. Each degree and type of learning has a different impact on the frequency and media richness of the partners' communication, and consequently each leads to a different level of social tie strength between the partners. This relationship is moderated by the partners' market overlap. We suggest that the required degree and type of interorganizational learning is contingent on the project characteristics (degree of innovation; radical versus incremental, and the mode of development; modular versus integrated). This relationship, however, is moderated by the partners' technical skills (complementary versus similar).",,,,"Badir, Yuosre F./G-7717-2013","Badir, Yuosre F./0000-0001-6267-2257",,,,,,,,,,,,0737-6782,1540-5885,,,,JAN,2015,32,1,,,,,154,169,,10.1111/jpim.12222,,,,,,,WOS:000345756000012,,,,,J,"Fang, G; Ma, XY; Ren, LQ; Zhou, Q",,,,"Fang, Gang; Ma, XiangYuan; Ren, Liqin; Zhou, Qing",,,Antecedents of Network Capability and Their Effects on Innovation Performance: An Empirical Test of Hi-tech Firms in China,CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"A firm's competitive advantage can come not only from internal resources but also from inter-firm innovation networks.

Therefore, many organizations invest in enterprise social media (ESM) to establish electronic networks of practice and to foster knowledge exchange among employees. ESM improves interaction transparency and can be regarded as a sociotechnical system that provides a language for communication and symbolic action as well as a better sense of others' social identity. Accordingly, the individual characteristics of knowledge seekers and contributors determine why and how interactions occur. However, existing studies tend to focus only on knowledge contributors' characteristics and to treat knowledge as an object that needs to be transferred. To address this gap, this study conceptualizes and empirically tests a multilevel model of knowledge exchange in electronic networks of practice (ENoP) that includes the characteristics of knowledge seekers and knowledge contributors as well as their dyadic relationship from an activity-centered language/action point of view. A dataset of 15,505 enterprise microblogging messages reveals that knowledge seekers' characteristics and relational factors drive knowledge exchanges in social media-enabled ENoP.

Using longitudinal data on 1385 developers and 190 publishers of video games in the global video game industry between 1972 and 2007, the analyses show that the effect of network ties between developers and publishers on the survival probability of developers is moderated by the level of technological turbulence in the industry. The results show that the effect of network partner failure on firm survival is dependent on the strength of ties. The failure of strongly tied network partners harms developers in stable periods and benefits them in turbulent eras, while no such relation is found for weakly tied network partners. Network partner diversity positively affects firm performance in epochs of technological turbulence, while the effect plays no significant role for firm survival in stable settings. The results indicate that the relation between interfirm network relations and firm survival are moderated by sequences of technological renewal in the video game industry which causes the industry to go through an evolution that deviates from the typical S-shaped trajectory found in industries that are characterized by strong path-dependent processes.

Organizational networking refers to firm behaviors, i.e. the activities/routines/practices, which enable an organization to make sense of and capitalize on their networks of direct and indirect business relationships. We conceptualize the measurement model as a second-order formative construct with four first-order reflective constructs based on a four-dimensional view of organizational networking comprising information acquisition, opportunity enabling, strong-tie resource mobilization and weak-tie resource mobilization. The scale validation was undertaken at the first- and second-order levels. The result confirms the four distinct first-order measurement models. At the second-order level, a MIMIC (multiple indicators and multiple causes) model was employed to assess the validity of the formative measurement model. The results suggest that all four components significantly contribute to the overarching construct of organizational networking, with strong-tie resource mobilization being the most important contributor. Thus, our operationalization confirms the uniqueness of the different dimensions of organizational networking that should be configured as a strategy of sensing and seizing opportunities in the network. The organizational networking scale will provide future research with a basis to explore different strategic patterns of networking behaviors in varying contexts, and its role in relation to other organizational behaviors and outcome variables, such as firm performance.

I investigate 2 types of knowledge content-information (i.e., facts or data) and frames (i.e., interpretations or impressions) and explore whether tie strength influences their effect on creativity. Drawing on creativity theory, I employ an experimental design to provide greater theoretical clarity and to isolate causality. According to the results from 2 studies, distinct frames received from contacts facilitate creativity, but the effect of distinct information is more complex. When individuals receive distinct information from strong ties, it constrains creativity compared to distinct frames. Content from weak ties appears to facilitate creativity across all scenarios. The results of mediated moderation analysis indicate the effect of framing versus information for strong ties is driven by decision-making time, as an indicator of cognitive expansion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-9010,1939-1854,,,,SEP,2014,99,5,,,,,831,846,,10.1037/a0036385,,,,,,,WOS:000341842200004,24684668,,,,J,"Venkataramani, V; Richter, AW; Clarke, R",,,,"Venkataramani, Vijaya; Richter, Andreas W.; Clarke, Ronald",,,Creative Benefits From Well-Connected Leaders: Leader Social Network Ties as Facilitators of Employee Radical Creativity,JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Employee radical creativity critically depends on substantive informational resources from others across the wider organization.

Nonetheless, multipartner alliances do benefit from built-in stabilizing third-party ties that mitigate opportunism and conflict between partner pairs. Previous empirical research on multipartner alliance stability has been inconclusive. We shed some light on these inconsistencies by recognizing that within multipartner alliances, schisms can occur not only between a pair of partners but also between subgroups of partners that are divided by faultlines. We suggest that divisive faultlines can form between subgroups of partners within a multipartner alliance as a function of their prior experience with one another. When a subgroup of alliance partners has relatively strong ties to each other and weak ties to other partners, destabilizing factions can develop that hamper reciprocity among the partners. Using a longitudinal analysis of 59 multipartner alliances, we found that, in general, faultlines (as modeled by the dispersion of tie strength within multipartner alliances) increase the hazard of unplanned dissolutions. We also found that multipartner alliances comprising a mix of centrally and peripherally positioned partners within the industry network were less apt to suffer the effects of divisive faultlines. We suggest that this is due to the greater opportunity costs of dissolution and the presence of relatively high-status partners who can act as peacekeepers and coordinators of their lower-status partners.",,,,"Heidl, Ralph/E-3417-2019; Phelps, Corey/B-8251-2017","Heidl, Ralph/0000-0001-6987-7087; Phelps, Corey/0000-0003-0486-8811",,,,,,,,,,,,1047-7039,,,,,SEP-OCT,2014,25,5,,,,,1351,1371,,10.1287/orsc.2014.0898,,,,,,,WOS:000342281700004,,,,,J,"Perry-Smith, JE; Shalley, CE",,,,"Perry-Smith, Jill E.; Shalley, Christina E.",,,A Social Composition View of Team Creativity: The Role of Member Nationality-Heterogeneous Ties Outside of the Team,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"We sought to understand team member informal social network ties outside of the team as a way to achieve cognitive variation within the team, thereby facilitating creativity.

The findings reveal that MNC parents can indeed cultivate subsidiaries' ability to appropriate marketing knowledge through a combination of adopting specific social structures and investing in particular efforts.

In this context, knowledge and knowledge transfer are considered an important source of innovation and competitive advantage. Social capital theory offers a theoretical approach to explain how individuals, groups, and organizations manage relationships and access knowledge resources. The structural dimension of social capital has stimulated debate regarding optimal network configuration to achieve innovation. The extant literature suggests network structures evolve from a bridging configuration to a bonding configuration without examining the details of how the evolution occurs within the network and its stage-by-stage impact on knowledge transfer. This study explores this relationship by analyzing the evolution of a successful Irish pharmaceutical network involving organizations from industry and academia. This research setting encompasses a rare network configuration in an industry known for its lack of collaboration among competing firms., Findings show that structural holes provide access to a set of complementary and heterogeneous knowledge. However, for such knowledge to be exploited, the network configuration has to evolve from a sparse network (small in size and characterized by weak ties across multiple organizational networks), to a large and cohesive network configuration characterized by high levels of commitment, trust, fine-grained information exchange, and joint problem solving. Mechanisms crucial to this evolution include consistently-scheduled meetings, training to communicate tacit knowledge, wide diffusion of knowledge through an on online portal, and relationship specific investments designed to safeguard intellectual property. Surprisingly, industry members appear to transition to a cohesive network faster than do academic members. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This study proposes that relational ties have a nonlinear effect on specific knowledge acquisition and that this nonlinear relationship is conditional on contract specificity and competitive intensity. Results from a sample of 385 manufacturer-supplier exchanges in China demonstrate that a buyer's relational ties with its major supplier have an inverted U-shaped effect on specific knowledge acquisition from this supplier; this inverted U-shaped relationship is stronger (steeper) when contract specificity is high and competition is more intense.

This article outlines several key differences between traditional offline social networks and online social media networks by juxtaposing an established typology of social network research with a well-regarded definition of social media platforms that articulates four key features. The results show that at four major points of intersection, social media has considerable theoretical implications for SNA.

Drawing upon survey data from 218 inter-organizational projects in the German engineering industry, we propose and find empirically that potential and realized absorptive capacity have partially distinct antecedents. Moreover, we show that the two components of absorptive capacity unfold not only separate but also complementary effects on innovation, implying that the whole of absorptive capacity is greater than its parts.

This idea builds upon the observation that creative ideas are ""often the result of the assemblage of different perspectives and approaches people are exposed to via social interactions."" (Baer, 2010, p 592) When the suspicions and doubts inherent in these different perspectives are prematurely pruned, known facts and low-risk understanding replace innovation and breakthrough KM activity. This is a problem that plagues Japan today. An aversion to interactions with people outside of a small in-group impedes knowledge sharing in Japan, and now manifests itself through ""KM anxieties"" as an obstacle to innovation, economic competitiveness, and understanding of the outside world. KM anxieties are not unique to the Japanese, but they are perhaps more prevalent due to Japanese reluctance to establish or explore what Granovetter (1973) called ""weak ties."" This situation largely exists due to confidence issues involved in dealing with strangers and unverified knowledge, and could be rectified if software agents were used to establish acceptable trust situations with previously unknown actors and information. With these ideas in mind, this paper considers three main themes. The first theme, addressed in section two of this paper, explores the importance of weak ties for knowledge sharing. In section three we examine the reasons for the pervasive condition of limited trust situations in Japanese society. We then probe the need and role for software agents in mitigating the trust problem in section four.

It is reasonable that both social relationships-strong or weak-may have domestic position in employment decisions because different cultural backgrounds may lead to several of behavior patterns. On one hand, strong ties are important for positions which are crucial and scarce, especially when one's personality is not distinctive. On the other hand, for jobs which require general skill and experience, weak ties can provide enough help.

Interpartner trust develops through the mechanisms of trust transfer and trust conversion, and managing both is an important management issue. The research question to be answered in this chapter is, How to manage trust-building processes and methods in public-private strategic alliances? The five processes of connection, communication, direction, temporary groups, and resource-sharing are found to build trust in interpartner contexts. Moreover, the processes of connection, communication, and temporary groups are found to contribute to the mechanism of trust transfer, while the process of direction appears to contribute to the mechanism of trust conversion. Although the process of resource-sharing is found to contribute mostly to the mechanism of trust transfer, when the managers get their employees to share resources with their alliance partners, this process may also contribute to trust conversion. Moreover, managing these processes consciously constitutes top-down processes that contribute to trust conversion. This chapter discusses in depth these five trust-building processes both theoretically and practically, and develops an outline of how the processes might be managed in practice. Furthermore, several methods or tools that entail one or more of the trust-building processes are presented; and four cases from public private settings further illustrate how the processes and methods can be used, or not used, in practice. The findings show that applying and managing the trust-building processes and methods has a positive influence on trust-building in public private alliances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-62396-487-0; 978-1-62396-488-7,,,,2014,,,,,,,127,150,,,,,,,,,WOS:000335808300004,,,,,J,"Chollet, B; Geraudel, M; Mothe, C",,,,"Chollet, Barthelemy; Geraudel, Mickael; Mothe, Caroline",,,Generating Business Referrals for SMEs: The Contingent Value of CEOs' Social Capital*,JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"We examine how small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) chief executive officers' (CEOs) social capital (as measured by strength of ties and structural holes) can help them bring business to their firms through the spread of positive referrals.

Findings - This study provides four major findings which shed a new light on how to comprehend the features of knowledge flow and the role-specific nodes in knowledge networks in organizations: the within-business unit knowledge flows are more dominant over the inter-business units knowledge flow; the downward knowledge flows are dominant over the horizontal and upward knowledge flows in the management levels; distributions of knowledge owners and providers are like L-shape and the gap between knowledge owing and providing expands as the management levels go up; and the top 20 percent people in an organization dominate over a large portion of the knowledge brokerage activities.

Individuals and organisations are becoming increasingly involved in collaboration networks to share knowledge and generate innovation.

Design/methodology/approach - This review covers studies of SC in organisational behaviour, strategy and management over a period of 20 years. Findings - The literature review shows that knowledge types and knowledge transfer processes are the missing links in the relationship between structural SC and innovation. Moreover, the paper demonstrates that seemingly opposite configurations of SC are complementary to each other (structural holes vs dense networks; strong vs weak ties) and that contextual factors should be considered when discussing the effects of SC on knowledge transfer and innovation. In addition, it is the balance of different configurations of SC which enables an individual or a company to explore, access, assimilate and combine different knowledge types, which will lead to improved innovation outcomes.

First, firms may innovate through recombinant creation, i.e., by creating technological combinations new to the firm. Second, they may innovate through recombinant reuse; i.e., by reconfiguring combinations already known to the firm. We study what drives each type of capability by examining two factors: the degree of integration of a firm's intraorganizational network and the diversity of its knowledge base. We test our theoretical predictions using data on 126 semiconductor firms between 1984 and 2003.

This research effort contributes to a growing stream of research in social network theory suggesting that the contradictory theories of the strength of weak ties and weak network structures on the one hand and the theory of strong ties and closed network structures on the other have a mutually reinforcing effect on innovation outcomes if combined rather than considered separately. An in-depth exploratory single case study approach within an innovatively organized national R&D collaboration allowed giving further evidence for such a superior innovation performance and for this research to contribute to theory by demonstrating why and how such a combination may lead to higher innovation output and how this effect can be actively reinforced. It is suggested that the combination of strong and weak ties should occur at the individual rather than at the project or firm level. The authors distinguish between the additive effects of the respective innovation benefits of strong and weak ties, a positive interaction effect in the portfolio of dyadic ties of an individual and a second multilevel interaction effect of weak ties embedded in the ambidextrous network structure. Referring to previous empirical findings, intellectual property regulation and structural interdependency between network members showed a higher impact than trust with regard to leveraging weak ties and are important sources for achieving the multilevel interaction effect. Managerial implications of this research are that a large network will outperform several smaller, independent networks given that the right structure and processes are in place.

To solve this puzzle, we clarify the distinction between having social capital and using contacts as a search method. We present theoretical reasons to suggest that the lack of an association between a job seeker's social capital and whether or not she uses social networks to search for a job should not be taken to imply that job seekers who use social networks to search for jobs do not benefit from using contacts. We exploit a strategic research setting, the school-to-work transition of 291 university graduates who engaged in 3,112 contemporaneous job searches, to show that although a job seeker's social capital may not affect whether or not she uses contacts to search for a job, using contacts as a job-search method does improve her job-search outcomes.

Studying three cases of solution providers which involve external service partners for solution delivery, we find that solution customer centricity - the degree to which the focal firm focuses on solution customers in the joint delivery of solutions - moderates the relationship between partner networks and open business model performance. For open business models with low solution customer centricity, a network configuration characterized by many weak ties to service partners leads to superior performance. Conversely, for open business models with high solution customer centricity, few but strong ties to partners lead to superior performance. Based on these findings, three ideal configurations of networks for open business models are derived: the controlled, the Joint, and the supported model. The findings of this paper are especially relevant for managers of product-focused firms who seek guidance in evolving their business models into solution providers.

Yet, the scope and mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unclear. I propose a general theoretical framework that initially takes the stand-alone favor, rather than reciprocity, as a mode of economic allocation and identifies its institutional support structures. Markets and hierarchies shape favor-doing alongside social networks, often as a byproduct of their other functions. I find empirical evidence for social networks and market pricing as support structures for favors in the Russian post-socialist labor market of the 1990s. The mechanisms behind social networks are prior history and the general norm of reciprocity, while market pricing induces favors by those employers positioned in the middle of the wage distribution and thus exhibiting simultaneously two qualities: a willingness to do favors, because the jobs they have to offer are not sufficiently lucrative to attract the very best talent, and an ability to ask for favors, because nevertheless those jobs remain attractive enough for job seekers at large. Overall, this study shows how labor market institutions, originally set up to support competitive exchanges, affect the likelihood of favors in hiring, in tandem with the traditional support structure, social networks.

Thus, different alternatives will influence the external social networks differently, affecting strategic flexibility and organisational learning, as the literature on external social networks suggests that they can affect strategic flexibility and organisational learning positively. Through a comparative analysis of variance and stepwise regressions, we observed that external social networks affect strategic flexibility and organisational learning positively, primarily based on the greater size of the networks. On the other hand, we found that depending on the kind of QM initiative implemented in the organisation, other effects vary. For example, in organisations without QM, the range of external social networks influences strategic flexibility negatively, whereas in organisations with ISO standards, this negative effect disappears. In organisations with TQM, we found the positive effect of both size and strength of relations on the networks. For organisational learning, a negative relationship was found between organisational capability and network range for the non-QM firm group.

Little empirical research examines how these two types of variables are in fact related: how do extrinsic and intrinsic motivation explain the position that an employee entertains in a knowledge sharing network within an organization? Much is to be gained from a better understanding of how, empirically, psychological variables and an organization's network interrelate (Burt et al., 1998; Kalish and Robins, 2006; Moch, 1980; Teigland and Wasko, 2009). Still, this line of enquiry is not pursued much (Foss et al., 2009). This paper integrates the structural characteristics known to be implicated in knowledge transfer typically focused on in the social network literature on the one hand, with the motivational perspective commonly identified in the organization literature. This study examines how motivation - extrinsic (expected organizational rewards, reciprocal benefits) and intrinsic (knowledge self-efficacy, enjoyment in helping others) - might explain how employees may be better connected in the full knowledge transfer network or might be engaged more in inter-unit knowledge transfer. Connectedness (closeness centrality) and inter-unit ties are well-known to contribute to knowledge transfer. Analyzing data from a survey at two large European organizations, this study, counterintuitively, shows that neither intrinsic nor extrinsic motivation explain an individual's favorable position in a knowledge transfer network.

Findings show that while science productivity and reputation are strongly associated with having either a center or discipline leadership position, they are less strongly associated with administrative leadership. Also, larger and more dense collaboration networks predict having a center leadership position, but the opposite is true for holding an administrative leadership position. Women are more likely to be in discipline leadership positions and less likely to be a leader of a research center or have an administrative university leadership position. Finally, having more women in the network reduces the likelihood of holding discipline or center leadership positions.

We argue that strong ties to potentially influential organization members who are ambivalent about a change (fence-sitters) provide the change agent with an affective basis to coopt them. This cooptation increases the probability that the organization will adopt the change. By contrast, strong ties to potentially influential organization members who disapprove of a change outright (resistors) are an effective means of affective cooptation only when a change diverges little from institutionalized practices. With more divergent changes, the advantages of strong ties to resistors accruing to the change agent are weaker, and may turn into liabilities that reduce the likelihood of change adoption.

This problem is especially salient in IS project teams. Such teams are temporary organizations that may not progress through the necessary team formation cycle, yet are expected to produce intangible outcomes in a limited time. In this paper, we investigate how bonding and bridging social capital influence knowledge sharing and project performance. Bonding could facilitate cohesiveness within a team and lead a team to achieve project goals. Bridging could facilitate access to various beneficial resources beyond the boundary of a project team, increasing creativity and innovation. However, bridging is costly and can obstruct project performance. Our findings suggest that team members with high bonding social capital are more likely to share their knowledge with their team. Bonding and intention to share knowledge also positively affect project performance. Conversely, bridging social capital can contribute to project performance only through the mediating effect of bonding. This research contributes to theory by empirically examining the two types of social capital and their interdependence, as predictors of knowledge sharing and subsequently project performance. Project managers should form teams composed of members with diverse social connections and consider the balance between bonding and bridging within a team to control the potential disadvantageous effects of bridging social capital.

Findings suggest that ties form when unfamiliar people identify desirable and matching traits in potential partners. By contrast, ties persist when familiar people reflect on the quality of their relationship and shared experiences. The former calls for shallow, short-term strategies for assessing a broad array of potential ties; the latter calls for long-term strategies and substantive assessments of a relationship's worth so as to draw extended rewards from the association.

The results show that alternative sources of knowledge are considerably more important than external personal networks. Specifically, the results confirm the hypothesis that the lower the job position, the less important are external personal networks. The most frequent type of knowledge that is uniquely available through personal networks concerns business knowledge of senior managers rather than technological knowledge. Furthermore, the analysis supports the view that external personal networks are most important for exploratory keeping up-to-date than for problem solving. Finally, the paper shows that external personal networks are more important for firms whose competitiveness is primarily driven by being cutting-edge in technology.

We hold that the phenomenon of managerial entrenchment should be observed through social capital theory lens, looking into the type and nature of the relationship between the manager and the entity holding corporate. We identified mechanisms that influence the creation and mobilization of managers' social capital with regard to the specific context of the Croatian transition economy and the large stake of state-owned companies present in the Croatian business sector. The primary cause why managers dominantly entrench themselves through their social ties is the fact that Croatian economy is characterized with concentrated ownership and, thus, they have an easier time to create relationships with the shareholders.

We argue that, in the context of Croatian economy, managers don't necessarily work towards entrenching themselves as a strategic and conscious entrenchment act.

Design/methodology/approach - The semi-structured interview approach is used to gather data from 25 recruitment specialists. Findings - The connector role is identified as a specific attraction mechanism recruiters use to create numerous weak ties, where some are so weak they barely constitute ties at all. The authors then identify branding, transparency and data specificity as three mechanisms recruiters use to strengthen these ties when performing the attracting and screening functions.

As knowledge becomes more and more specialized, intensive communication between researchers from various disciplines is required. Communication is a key factor for process coordination and organisational creativity. Although new channels of communication are now available, personal face-to-face meetings remain essential. Physical movement during work has been neglected in research and management: Physical movement not only influences cognitive performance, learning ability and individual creativity, it also affects the attitude to a task, work habits and the mood. It is a communication medium in and of itself. Triggered by the environment, it affects the characteristics of chance encounters, which in turn influences communication. This study is based on a single-case case study of a research team (n=27) of a multinational pharmaceutical company. It examines the communication patterns and the physical movement behaviour during communication of natural scientists before and after moving from a traditional cell space research and work environment into a modern multi-space building. This radically new work environment offers a wide range of open and closed workspaces as well as individual and communal work areas. The findings show that in an open multi-space work environment, the conversation lengths are immediately adjusted to the new environment, whereas the movement behaviour during conversation is adapted only after some time. Sitting during conversations has increased regarding the number of events whereas physical movement during conversations has decreased. In the multi-space work environment the lengths of communication events - distinguished by different behavioural patterns during communication - are timewise shorter than before the move. The duration of conversation while sitting has declined, it is now less than half as long as before the move. Previously they were by far the longest conversations. The impact on R&D productivity seems to be mixed.

During the mentoring periods accelerator management is actively involved with the portfolio firms and provides extensive networking support. The 2012 publication U.S. Seed Accelerator Rankings identified 71 U.S. accelerators and noted that their numbers are growing rapidly. In the U.S. alone it is estimated that more than 1,400 start-up companies are mentored annually by such firms. Accelerators are also growing rapidly and have become critical nodes in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Understanding relative accelerator performance and the characteristics driving superior performance can have a multiplier effect on overall start-up success. To that end, we consider two research questions in this paper: Do top-ranked accelerator portfolio firms display similar survival rates? And, what accelerator characteristics correlate with variations in portfolio firm survival? Network theory informs the hypotheses investigated in this study. In this study we compare the survival performance of accelerator portfolio firms in Silicon Valley and Ireland to those of other leading geographically dispersed accelerators. An analysis of the node characteristics in these ecosystems suggests that Silicon Valley portfolio firms will experience higher failure rates and Irish accelerator portfolio firms will experience lower failure rates then other regions. In contrast, network theory also suggests that hubs, such as accelerators, can help embed nodes, such as start-ups, in preferred networks and that such networking can enhance firm outcomes, such as survival. Network theory also suggests that establishing network ties comes at a cost, and that accelerator and start-up resources must be adequate to enable useful network connections. Smaller cohort sizes and larger capital investments are evaluated to determine if the additional resources resulting from these practices benefit firm survival. The resulting hypotheses are evaluated via t-tests and regression analyses on data from the portfolio firms of 18 top-ranked accelerators. Our results suggest that Irish accelerator portfolio firms experience lower failure rates than portfolio firms from other regions. Interestingly these results demonstrated only modest absolute differences in regional outcomes despite significant differences in the outcome objectives of the regional funding sources in Silicon Valley and Ireland which were considered in detail. Variation in accelerator practice on funding levels and cohort size were not found to significantly impact firm outcomes although accelerator experience was found to be significant to portfolio firm survival.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2049-1050,,978-1-909507-61-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,425,433,,,,,,,,,WOS:000362358400001,,,,,S,"Riverola, C; Miralles, F",,"Teirlinck, P; Kelchtermans, S; DeBeule, F",,"Riverola, Carla; Miralles, Francesc",,,Understanding Entrepreneurial Performance in a Networked Social Environment,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP, VOL 2",Proceedings of the European Conference on Entrepreneurship and Innovation,,,,8th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship (ECIE),"SEP 19-20, 2013","Hogeschool Univ Brussel, Brussels, BELGIUM",,Hogeschool Univ Brussel,,,"Several theories have been trying to identify the entrepreneur's success factors in order to improve new venture performance (Simpeh 2011). From a managerial point of view, the Resource-Based Theory considers that the founder's access to resources is an important mean for entrepreneurial performance (Bordieu 1983; Alvarez and Busenitz, 2001). Build under the Resource-Based Theory, the social capital of the entrepreneur studies how the individual's social network may provide external resources (such as knowledge, skills, capital, information...) to enhance its venture performance (Bordieu 1983; Aldrich and Zimmers 1986; Coleman 1990; Lee and Jones 2010). Concretely, strong ties (such as family or friends) are good for accessing finance and other resources (Lowik et al 2012); whereas weak ties are good for accessing information about structural holes and generating creative ideas (Burt 1992, 2004; Shane and Venkataraman 2000). It then seems clear that when increasing the entrepreneur's social capital, its performance should increase. Contrarily, some researchers identified that entrepreneurs working in a networked social environment - where they have more opportunities to develop and maintain ties through new IT - are having difficulties to identify structural holes (Teece 2009). Moreover, studies found that entrepreneurs may be fortifying the embeddedness of their social network rather than building on their weak ties (Newbert and Tornikoski 2012). In this sense, we hypothesize that the new ways of communicating are driving entrepreneurs to build embeddedness within their strong ties; leaving unattended the importance of developing weak ties to identify structural holes. This research work aims to approach this existing gap through identifying how the entrepreneur's strong and weak ties have been affected by this networked social environment, and what's the specific effect on entrepreneurial performance. Therefore, the contribution of this research may be for both academics and practitioners; through providing an accurate perspective of the entrepreneur's social capital on entrepreneurial performance.",,,,"Riverola, Carla/A-9442-2015","Riverola, Carla/0000-0002-3605-206X",,,,,,,,,,,,2049-1050,,978-1-909507-61-6,,,,2013,,,,,,,773,781,,,,,,,,,WOS:000362358400040,,,,,J,"Levine, SS; Prietula, MJ",,,,"Levine, Sheen S.; Prietula, Michael J.",,,How Knowledge Transfer Impacts Performance: A Multilevel Model of Benefits and Liabilities,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"When does knowledge transfer benefit performance?

We find that once cost and interpersonal exchange are included in the analysis, the impact of knowledge transfer is highly contingent. Depending on specific characteristics and circumstances, knowledge transfer can better, matter little to, or even harm performance. Three illustrative studies clarify puzzling past results and offer specific boundary conditions: (1) At the individual level, better organizational support for employee learning diminishes the benefit of knowledge transfer for organizational performance. (2) At the organization level, broader access to organizational memory makes global knowledge transfer less beneficial to performance. (3) When the organizational environment becomes more turbulent, the organizational performance benefits of knowledge transfer decrease. The findings imply that organizations may forgo investments in both organizational memory and knowledge exchange, that wide-ranging knowledge exchange may be unimportant or even harmful for performance, and that organizations operating in turbulent environments may find that investment in knowledge exchange undermines performance rather than enhances it.

Pressing challenges include keeping pace with shorter product life cycles, incorporating multiple technologies into the design of new products, cocreating products and services with customers and partners, and leveraging the growth of scientific and technical knowledge in many sectors. In response, we observe experimentation with new organization designs that are fundamentally different from existing forms of organizing. We propose that these new designs are based on an actor-oriented architectural scheme composed of three main elements: (1) actors who have the capabilities and values to self-organize; (2) commons where the actors accumulate and share resources; and (3) protocols, processes, and infrastructures that enable multi-actor collaboration. We demonstrate the usefulness of the actor-oriented scheme by applying it to organizations drawn from four different sectors: global professional services, open source software development, computer equipment, and national defense. We discuss the implications of the actor-oriented architectural scheme for future research on organizational forms as well as for managers who are involved in designing organizations.

The present paper investigates the role played by personal relationships within networks, addressing the following research questions: how do different types of relationships existing in a network of SMEs favour the development of economic activities? And do personal relationships play a role in supporting innovative activities? To answer our research questions, we analyzed qualitative data using content analysis methodology.

Therefore, the interconnectedness of a user within the network has to be considered explicitly to get a reasonable estimate for its economic value. Established standard business valuation models, however, do not account for these aspects sufficiently. Thus, we propose an economic model for the valuation of online social networks, which takes into account the users' interconnectedness within the network.

Although conventional wisdom suggests that horizontal ties between producers are driven solely by their prior interactions, we find that vertical ties drive the formation of horizontal relationships in a multiplex triad. We also find that these triads are affected by the agency of the customers who (a) force producers into horizontal relationships with those producers that have protected the customers' interests in the past and (b) prevent closure in triads containing strong horizontal relationships because of the divergent objectives of these triads' members.

Data is collected through a questionnaire survey from 342 individuals working in a variety of professions and industry sectors in New Zealand. Questions were asked to find the existence of ego-centred knowledge networks around professionals and the use of this network to acquire work-specific knowledge.

Communication is key for both creative tasks and the coordination of processes. Despite the introduction of a variety of different IT-mediated communication systems in the last decades, the critical importance of face-to-face communication has remained untouched. Direct encounters enable people to gain trust in one another and to transfer more than just the spoken language. An encounter between people who were not planning to meet may be especially fruitful. Such coincidental meetings, so-called chance encounters, lead to the creation of weak ties, i.e. loose relationships. These facilitate access to new knowledge while keeping the diversity of opinions high. Encounters also catalyze the transformation of loose relationships into strong ties. Strong ties are especially important for efficient coordination. Workspace design may help to coordinate work, reveal conflicting opinions to a greater or lesser degree, help management steer knowledge creation and support company-wide projects. Chance encounters especially are vital for knowledge sharing, knowledge creation and the development of new and innovative ideas. Based on two case studies in the pharmaceutical industry and in academia, this paper presents a framework that illustrates the impact of workspace design on encounters and communication. A holistic view of the design of the working environment, including its influence on the interactions between the employees and the barriers to and enablers of the flow of information, is presented. The findings show that the architecture of a building and the design of a workplace are important factors in increasing the number of face-to-face chance encounters. Another important, yet subordinate, factor which influences the number of chance encounters is the physical proximity to other researchers and companies. However, IT is the sphere of interaction in which most of the chance encounters take place. The findings of this study can help innovation managers and architects to shape innovative activities consciously. The framework and the figures which are presented in this paper finally help us to understand where chance encounters take place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-908272-67-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,190,197,,,,,,,,,WOS:000321565500023,,,,,B,"Tipuric, D; Sliskovic, T; Hruska, D",,"Schiuma, G; Spender, JC; Yigitcanlar, T",,"Tipuric, Darko; Sliskovic, Tanja; Hruska, Domagoj",,,The Role of Managers' Social Capital in Acquiring New Knowledge with Regard to the Ownership Structure of the Firm,"IFKAD - KCWS 2012: 7TH INTERNATIONAL FORUM ON KNOWLEDGE ASSET DYNAMICS, 5TH KNOWLEDGE CITIES WORLD SUMMIT: KNOWLEDGE, INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY: INTEGRATING MICRO & MACRO PERSPECTIVES",,,,,7th International Forum on Knowledge Asset Dynamics (IFKAD) / 5th Knowledge Cities World Summit (KCWS),"JUN 13-15, 2012","Matera, ITALY","Inst Knowledge Asset Management, Queensland Univ Technol, Univ Basilicata, World Capital Inst",,,,"Purpose - With our qualitative study of managers in private and state owned companies we wanted to see how the ownership structure of the firm influences the manner social capital affecting knowledge transfer within organizations is used and created. We anticipated that different mechanisms and different stakeholders seem to be important when forming the management's social capital. We observed the phenomena with an emphasis on the fact that Croatia is still in the early phase of development of good corporate governance practices and is characterized with a closed system of corporate governance. Also, we wanted to offer some practical implications considering the necessity of changing unconventional corporate governance practices in Croatia. Considering that this type of research has never been undertaken in this region, our study opens up new research horizons to be investigated with regard to idiosyncrasies of (post) transition economies. Design/methodology/approach - Due to the constructivist theoretical framework and the way research questions were set up, we used qualitative research methodology. Research methods used were open interviews (interview guide approach). We researched within 12 major Croatian companies where we interviewed 19 managers, in order to determine important categories and codes that helped us build a model of managerial entrenchment through their social capital. Originality/value - Even though social capital and its effect on knowledge transfer have been researched on numerous occasions, we have determined that the topic hasn't been researched in post-socialist economies. Considering that different cultural practices affect the nature of manager's social capital (Chua, Morris, Ingram, 2009), we saw an opportunity to show that social capital is used in a different manner in the South-east Europe region then in the established free-market economies with regard to ownership structure of the company. First, we expected that in state-owned firms social capital will turn out to be more underdeveloped than is the case in private enterprises. We also determined that no matter what the nature of the business, state-owned companies didn't use its social capital in a most productive manner if society's benefits as a whole are taken into account. As a matter of fact, social capital was used in order for managers to entrench themselves through political connections in all state owned companies we examined. Thus, our research provides a completely new insight on the effect of ownership structure on manager's social capital. Practical implications - As our research results show positive effects of social capital in terms of transferring and acquiring knowledge needed for problem solving, policy recommendations should be brought in Croatia in order for boards to support collaboration inside and outside organizations. Also, the negative consequences of social capital used in state owned companies regarding managerial entrenchment should be avoided for the benefit of making companies' business practices more transparent and accountable. The issue of state owning a large part of Croatian companies (over one third) carries many problems within the development of Croatian corporate governance. Knowing that state owned companies in transition countries have many obstacles that prevent them from doing business effectively, our research explicitly warns about one of the treats to obtaining lucrative business results within state owned companies. We suggest that future research in this track should determine how the phenomenon of different ownership structures affects the way social capital is nurtured.",,,,"Tipuric, Darko/H-8301-2018; Sliskovic, Tanja/H-8367-2018","Tipuric, Darko/0000-0001-8785-0179; Sliskovic, Tanja/0000-0003-2729-8364",,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-88-96687-08-6,,,,2012,,,,,,,2024,2045,,,,,,,,,WOS:000313556000106,,,,,J,"Guo, J; Liu, CH",,,,"Guo, Jeffrey; Liu, Chih-Hsing",,,The perspective of relationships: election strategies and sources of political capital,MANAGEMENT DECISION,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the multi-dimensions of social capital and to explore the relationships among individuals, social groups, and firms, establishing the perspective of relations for competition strategies and implementation.

An original viewpoint is presented in this chapter - the thinking is novel to integration literature and thought, and to social networks - that advances both research and practice of PMI. Since the network-view may be a new topic to many PMI researchers, the central discussion is preceded by a brief introduction to the concepts and techniques of social network analysis. The author offers that the organizational members' pre-existing social network can become disrupted by integration processes, which creates pressures on the individuals' previously stable social network. The individual members will therefore strive for a restabilization of their localized social network towards a specific pattern that is somewhat unique to each individual. During this social realignment there is an opportunity for integration managers to embrace this ""social reconciliation."" By recognizing the individuals' imminent stabilization point of this natural process, integration managers can proactively guide the social network toward an optimal, or productive, resting space that provides organizational benefit.

As expected, we found a significant relationship between the centrality of a network and individual performance. When network centrality was decomposed into three types (advice centrality, influence centrality and idea centrality), however, the relative strength of each type changed significantly based on performance type. We also found that the number of weak ties had a significant positive effect both on innovative and managerial performance. When considered together with network centrality and absorptive capacity, however, weak ties turned out to be nonsignificant as predictors of managerial performance, but the strongest predictors of innovative performance. In contrast, absorptive capacity had a positive effect on both types of individual performance, while its strength as a determinant of individual performance was weaker than that of network centrality and weak ties.

However, less attention has been paid to the factors that entice actors to shape social networks during the process of the development of new ideas. This research was conducted in an R&D facility of a semi-conductor company. We analysed the generation of five creative projects and their development over a four-year period. We used a longitudinal approach and collected data through interviews and observations to identify the creative contributions and the actors who were involved at different time periods for each project. We mapped the relationships between actors who contributed to the development of each idea through creative thinking and/or helped it to become accepted both internally and externally over three-year windows. This method generated data on network evolution. We also carried out a qualitative analysis and identified four main factors explaining why actors turn to others during the idea-development process: (1) to gain access to information; (2) to enhance credibility; (3) to exercise one's influence; and (4) to gain access to knowledge through people or objects. We demonstrate that different types of ties or network structures are relied upon to reap different kinds of benefits. This may partially explain network evolution as an idea progresses through different development stages. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the case of foreign inter-organizational relationships, we find that greater foreign client contact enhances the complexity of firm technological capabilities. However, accessing knowledge from domestic inter-organizational relationships appears to hinder the development of firm complex technological capabilities. An interesting result from our research was that having greater access to knowledge from foreign intra-organizational relationships, embedded within foreign subsidiaries, did not lead to the development of complex firm technological capabilities.

We start by considering the definition of network, noting some confusion caused by two different perspectives, which we refer to as realist and nominalist. We then analyze two well-known network theories, Granovetter's strength of weak ties theory [Granovetter, M. S. 1973. The strength of weak ties. Amer. J.

We argue that both theories share an underlying theoretical model, which we label the network flow model, from which we derive additional implications. We also discuss network phenomena that do not appear to fit the flow model and discuss the possibility of a second fundamental model, which we call the bond model.

Specifically, we hypothesize that assignees' social ties within and their perceived fit with the host unit positively relate to two sacrifices on leaving the organization: their firm-specific learning during the assignment, and their perceived career prospects in the organization. Perceived career prospects are expected to predict subsequent retention, moderated by firm-specific learning. These hypotheses are tested using a sample of 143 inpatriates in 10 German multinationals, with retention measured 2 and 4 years later. We show that inpatriates' trusting ties with HQ staff and their fit with the HQ positively relate to their firm-specific learning and their perceived career prospects, and that the latter predicts their retention 2 and 4 years later. Perceived career prospects mediate the direct relationship between inpatriates' fit with the HQ and inpatriate retention, and the indirect relationship between inpatriates' trusting ties with HQ staff and their retention. Furthermore, inpatriates' firm-specific learning mitigates the effect of perceived career prospects on retention decisions 2 years later.

Although Coleman focused on the quality of relationships, Burt argued that the structural configuration of relationships was more important. I argue that, instead of being alternative substitutes. Burt's social capital theory complements Coleman's theory. More precisely, I demonstrate that, in the presence of strong ties, weak network architectures (structural holes or a peripheral network position) leverage the strength of strong ties in the creation of innovation. This implies that weak network architectures have no value without strong ties, whereas strong ties have some value without weak network architectures but are leveraged by this type of structure. The findings indicate that innovation research tends to overestimate the impact of weak network architectures in the creation of innovation. By pointing to the necessity of strong ties, the results may be of particular interest for research on open innovation. They suggest that open innovation will not work if closed innovation principles are pushed back. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the willingness to share knowledge is rooted in different relational models and that people only share knowledge when they share similar relational models.

Further, in over half of the cases, the supervisor (the Nurse Unit Manager (NUM)) holds the centric position. Moreover, for those nurses who did not include the NUM in their workplace network, their position appears even worse. For example, the usual reason given by nurses for not including the NUM was that the NUM was unavailable.

A wide range of literature has analysed social capital and its beneficial effects, however, despite the extensive investigations of social capital, there is surprisingly enough still a lack of studies investigating the role of the structural configuration of the social capital for employees' individual learning. The objective of this paper is to address this gap in the literature, enhancing our understanding of the links between social capital and individual learning. An online questionnaire survey was administered to 252 employees affiliated with the 22 pharmacies. The analysis was made through ordinal logistic regression models based on maximum likelihood estimations. The results suggest that the presence of structural holes first increases the degree of individual learning, then reaches a maximum and begins to decrease gradually. The mechanism at work in the relationship between structural holes and individual learning is an interesting area for further research.

In response to the need for speedy knowledge collaboration, professionals often rely on their ego-centered (i.e. personal) knowledge networks. Ego-centered knowledge networks are ties that develop through work-related interactions and/or professional associations. Such ties exist irrespective of the organizational boundaries and formal structures and create when people work together, carry out projects mutually; attend joint trainings or workshops, participate in the activities of professional communities, and so on and so forth. Studies have indicated positive contribution of personal knowledge networking in fostering cooperative learning and improving problem-solving capabilities of individuals. Nonetheless, literature on information and knowledge sharing widely discussed such knowledge sharing activities in collocated teams and within organizational boundaries. Many contemporary knowledge management researchers, however, are of the view that knowledge cannot be constrained within boundaries and structures and that most new knowledge lies outside organizational boundaries. In search of non-redundant and specialist knowledge, employees develop ad-hoc knowledge collaboration with colleagues, in their relevant professions and knowledge domains, regardless of the time and space constraints. Knowledge can be defined as the know-how or expertise that is mainly possessed by humans. The way to knowledge is via connecting to people who know or who know whom to contact for a specific problem solution. In today's knowledge economy, there is a crucial need to pay attention to the fast, reliable, and economic sources of knowledge that can help knowledge workers to quickly resolve complex problems at work. While addressing this need, knowledge management research has largely discussed knowledge sources that exist within organizational boundaries and that can be arranged through formal structures and organizational mechanisms. So far, little is known how knowledge is mediated through personal interactions and informal communication between knowledge workers who belong to similar professions but work in different organizations and work settings. In fact, evidence from some of the knowledge-intensive professions, such as, bio-technology, information and communication technology, software development, and so on, suggest that personal connections between knowledge workers provide significant opportunities to access specialized knowledge. In these professions, interactions between knowledge workers are not constrained by the boundaries and formal structures. Although social networking studies have highlighted the significance of informal knowledge sharing, little is known about how professionals deal with the opportunities and complexities of knowledge collaboration that exist within their ego-centered knowledge networks. Knowledge management scholars have discussed the use of transactive memory (i.e. who knows what) in determining the locus of expertise to solve a problem. Information and knowledge sharing literature focus on trust to manage individual concerns and the risks involved in informal information or know-how exchange. Informal know-how trading literature highlighted reciprocity to foster useful knowledge exchange relationships; in the absence of formal knowledge sharing structures and mechanisms. Combining these, this paper argues that transactive memory, trust, and reciprocity can provide necessary conditions to allow knowledge workers to collaborate freely and share their know-how and expertise in their ego-centered knowledge networks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-908272-20-1,,,,2011,,,,,,,681,688,,,,,,,,,WOS:000304696000078,,,,,S,"Schwab, A; Miner, AS",,"Cattani, G; Ferriani, S; Frederiksen, L; Taube, F",,"Schwab, Andreas; Miner, Anne S.",,,ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING IMPLICATIONS OF PARTNERING FLEXIBILITY IN PROJECT-VENTURE SETTINGS: A MULTILEVEL FRAMEWORK,PROJECT-BASED ORGANIZING AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT,Advances in Strategic Management-A Research Annual,,,,,,,,,,,"Project ventures are an increasingly prevalent organizational form in many industries. The management literature has stressed their flexibility and adaptability advantages. This chapter focuses on the learning implications of the source of flexibility most essential to project ventures: the ability to switch partners during project formation and execution. This partnering flexibility creates opportunities to respond to new knowledge about characteristics of project tasks and project partners. Partnering flexibility, however, also creates learning challenges. The short-term nature of relationships between project partners and the disintegration of the project team after project completion challenges the accumulation and transfer of knowledge to future projects. Beyond the introduction of related learning opportunities and challenges, we identify potential contingency factors in the project context that shape when partner flexibility will have beneficial versus harmful effects. On the organizational level, we propose that project-governing permanent organizations can support project-venture learning. On the industry level, we highlight potential learning benefits of standardized partner roles and coordination practices.

Previous research has presented different and even conflicting empirical results concerning the effect of structural holes on innovation activities, and has not dealt specifically with the ideation phase of the innovation process. By drawing upon an idea database from a Swedish company that has worked systematically with idea management for an extensive period, this study investigates the interrelationship between social capital and ideation. The empirical study reveals that the larger the size of an individual's ego network, the higher is this individual's innovative performance in terms of high-quality ideas, whereas the larger the number of structural holes in an ego network, the lower is the quality of ideas generated by the individual in question. These findings support the conclusion that social capital, in terms of individuals' relationships with fellow employees within firms, has a positive influence on idea-generating behavior.

The Role of Tie Content and Social Networks,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Understanding the determinants of creativity at the individual and organizational level has been the focus of a long history of research in various disciplines from the social sciences, but little attention has been devoted to studying creativity at the dyadic level. Why are some dyadic interactions more likely than others to trigger the generation of novel and useful ideas in organizations? As dyads conduit both knowledge and social forces, they offer an ideal setting to disentangle the effects of knowledge diversity, tie strength, and network structure on the generation of creative thoughts. This paper not only challenges the current belief that sporadic and distant dyadic relationships (weak ties) foster individual creativity but also argues that diverse and strong ties facilitate the generation of creative ideas. From a knowledge viewpoint, our results suggest that ties that transmit a wide (rather than narrow) set of knowledge domains (within the same tie) favor creative idea generation if exchanges occur with sufficient frequency. From a social perspective, we find that strong ties serve as effective catalysts for the generation of creative ideas when they link actors who are intrinsically motivated to work closely together. Finally, this paper also shows that dyadic network cohesion (i.e., the connections from the focal dyad to common contacts) does not always hinder the generation of creative ideas. Our empirical evidence suggests that when cohesion exceeds its average levels, it becomes detrimental to creative idea generation.

This research draws on the literature on formal modeling of networks to examine the interaction between knowledge codification and knowledge-sharing networks. The analysis suggests that an increase in codification may damage existing network-sharing ties. Anticipating that, individuals may hoard their knowledge to protect their network ties, even when there are nontrivial rewards for codification. We find that despite the aforementioned tension between the codification and the network approach, a firm may still benefit from combining the two approaches. Specifically, when the future sharing potential between knowledge workers is high, a combination of the two approaches may outperform a codification-only or a network-only approach because the codification reward causes fewer network ties to break down, and the benefit from increased codification can offset the loss of some network ties. However, when the future sharing potential is low, an increase in codification reward can quickly break down the whole network.

Recognizing two broad categories of information-that is, task and social information-this study investigates and compares the antecedents of task and social information seeking. Deriving from the relational communication perspective, informational and relational motivations are modeled as the two main antecedents of source preference and sourcing frequency in dyadic information seeking. Through a survey of employee dyads, our findings indicate that perceived information relevance is a significant antecedent of source preference for both task and social information seeking, whereas perceived relational benefit is significant in the context of task information. The results also show that perceived relational benefit has a stronger effect on source preference in task information seeking than in social information seeking. Furthermore, preference for a source is a significant antecedent of the frequency of sourcing in both contexts.

Specifically, how does the density of informal networks affect an actor's ability to access and integrate diverse information and consequently that actor's innovation performance? The arguments are developed using the setting of 79 senior partners in a global management consulting firm and tested on a dataset of 1,449 informal relationships. I distinguish between internal, external, local, and global relations and find that this separation permits a more nuanced understanding of the effect of network structure on innovation performance. Specifically, I argue that the most effective network strategy is contingent upon the context in which the partners operate. The findings show that partners operating in homogeneous contexts, where the primary challenge is to access diverse information, benefit from low-density networks. In contrast, when crossing both firm and geographic boundaries, partners with dense networks have higher innovation performance. I argue that in such heterogeneous contexts, dense network interactions facilitate partners' ability to integrate the diverse information to which they are exposed.

This paper focuses on the role of a firm's social networks and national innovation system context in influencing the social epistemology around potential breakthrough innovations. Through an examination of the processes of drug development related to the same candidate substance in a Japanese firm and an American firm, we suggest that, in addition to organizational capabilities at the corporate level, social capital, specifically formed under a certain innovation system, plays a key role in leading to the successful introduction of breakthrough innovations.

The main objective of this research is to propose a literature-based framework based on innovation network theory and complemented with C-K theory, in order to analyze the invention/innovation process of inventors and the product concepts in a packaging industry context. Empirical input from three case studies of packaging inventions and their inventors is used to elaborate the suggested framework. The article identifies important gaps in the literature of innovation networks. This is addressed through a theoretical framework based on network theories, complemented with C-K theory for the product design level. The strength-of-ties dimension of the theoretical framework suggests, in agreement with the mainstream literature and the cases presented, that weak ties are required to access the knowledge related to exploration networks and strong ties are required to utilize the knowledge in the exploitation network. The transformation network is an intermediate step acting as a bridge where entrepreneurs can find required knowledge. The transformation network is also an intermediate step where entrepreneurs find financing and companies interested in commercializing inventions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Within the latter view, knowledge is understood as a socially constructed and shared resource, and the focus is on the characteristics of the social relationships connecting the various actors and on the benefits these bring to the participants. Even though it is widely agreed that knowledge is essentially social by nature and that social capital does matter to the corporate bottom line, there are relatively few previous studies that have empirically examined the impact of social capital on organizational growth. To bridge this gap, the paper empirically examines how social capital residing in both intra-organizational and inter-organizational relationships of firms is related with organizational growth. The results suggest that contrary to the theoretical claims in the existing literature, social capital has only meagre role in promoting organizational growth.

The focal unit of adoption has mainly been individuals and organizations, however, research at the group or social network levels as well as the interorganizational level has recently gained increased interest from information systems (IS) researchers. This recent focus views the world as being the sum of all relations. Various social network theories exist that seek to emphasize different proficiencies of social networks and explain theoretical mechanisms for behavior in social networks. The core idea of these theories is that social networks are valuable, and the relations among actors affect the behavior of individuals, groups, organizations, industries, and societies. IS researchers have also found that social network theory can help explain technology adoption. Some researchers, in addition, acknowledge that most adoption situations involve phenomena occurring at multiple levels, yet most technology adoption research applies a single level of analysis. Multilevel research can address the levels of theory, measurement, and analysis required to fully examining research questions. This chapter, therefore, adapts the Coleman diagram into the Multilevel Framework of Technology Adoption in order to explain how social network theory, at the individual and social network levels, can help explain adoption of IT.

Findings - This research proved that both instrumental and expressive ties will facilitate trust and knowledge transfer. Cognition-based trust is not essential when low-tacit, general knowledge is transferred, and the effect of the expressive tie becomes negative when trust is controlled. When transferring general knowledge the instrumental tie is more efficient. However, contrary to the hypothesis, it is found that the effect of the expressive tie is not significantly larger than that of the instrumental tie during the tacit knowledge transfer process. Research limitations/implications - Besides tacitness, future research may consider involving more dimensions of knowledge into the theoretical model.

Most feedback is given to frontline employees directly rather than submitted through formal channels. UZnfortunately, employees tend to be reluctant to report such unsolicited feedback. This paper seeks to explore key drivers of employees' willingness to report customer feedback to facilitate organizational learning. Specifically, the paper examines the joint effects of relational social capital, structural social capital, feedback valence (FV) (positive versus negative), and the intended use of information (service improvement versus performance evaluation) on employees' willingness to report unsolicited customer feedback back to the organization. Design/methodology/approach - The paper used two studies. First, semi-structured in-depth interviews of employees across organizational levels in two service firms were conducted to explore the relationships between the variables of interest. Second, a quasi-experimental study was conducted in which FV and intended use of information were manipulated in a true experimental design, and respondents' organization served as backdrop to measure relational and structural social capital. Findings - FV and the intended use of information moderate the impact of social capital on employees' reporting intention. Specifically, the authors found that social capital had a positive impact on employees' willingness to report negative feedback used for evaluation purposes (social capital was less important when used for service improvements). In contrast, for positive feedback, social capital had a positive impact when feedback was used for service improvements (but less so in an evaluation context where staff were naturally motivated to report positive feedback). Practical implications - Firms need to boost social capital to enhance employees' willingness to report negative feedback that is used for performance evaluation, and positive feedback that is used for understanding and cementing strengths. Social capital can be enhanced through increasing trust and a shared vision (through open and frequent communications), and through providing incentives (rewards and recognition) and improved reporting processes, infrastructure, and training. Originality/value - Service employees' reporting behavior of customer feedback received is important but under-researched.

A pre-requisite for innovation is the understanding of how destinations source, share and use knowledge. This conceptual paper examines the nature of networks and how their analysis can shed light upon the processes of knowledge sharing in destinations as they strive to innovate. The paper conceptualizes destinations as networks of connected organizations, both public and private, each of which can be considered as a destination stakeholder. In network theory, they represent the nodes within the system. The paper shows how epidemic diffusion models can act as analogies for knowledge communication and transfer within a destination network. These models can be combined with other approaches to network analysis to shed light on how destination networks operate, and how they can be optimized with policy intervention to deliver innovative and competitive destinations. The paper closes with a practical tourism example taken from the Italian destination of Elba. Using numerical simulations, the case demonstrates how the Elba network can be optimized. Overall, this paper demonstrates the considerable utility of network analysis for tourism in delivering destination competitiveness.dagger.",,,,"Baggio, Rodolfo/D-5469-2014","Baggio, Rodolfo/0000-0001-9207-9665",,,,,,,,,,,,0264-2069,,,,,,2010,30,10,,,,,1757,1771,PII 924695989,10.1080/02642060903580649,,,,,,,WOS:000280386000012,,,,,J,"Squire, B; Cousins, PD; Brown, S",,,,"Squire, Brian; Cousins, Paul D.; Brown, Steve",,,"Cooperation and Knowledge Transfer within Buyer-Supplier Relationships: The Moderating Properties of Trust, Relationship Duration and Supplier Performance",BRITISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper examines the effect of relational factors on knowledge transfer within strategic buyer-supplier exchange. Prior research examining inter-firm knowledge transfer has focused almost exclusively on horizontal forms of governance such as strategic alliances and joint ventures, whilst research on vertical forms, such as buyer-supplier relationships, is limited. We test the effect of four important relational properties: cooperation, trust, relationship duration and supplier performance. Quantitative data, gathered from 104 UK manufacturing firms in eight industry sectors, are used to analyse the hypothesized relationships through a moderated hierarchical regression model. Our study provides support for the importance of considering relational factors in the transfer of knowledge at the inter-organizational level. In particular, the results indicate that knowledge transfer is positively influenced by the extent of cooperation, but that this relationship is moderated by the level of trust and the performance of the supplier firm.

This paper takes a more detailed look by analyzing the connection between different types of innovation and forms of networking. Based on the market novelty of innovation outcomes and the extent to which innovation activities require new competences, four types of innovation are identified. It is proposed that these types correlate with various innovation network dimensions, including the volume of networks, the strength and content of ties, and the specificity of ties. Drawing on survey data of 594 innovations realized by Dutch small firms, it is observed that the requirement to access new competences for innovation correlates positively with the number of network partners involved. We also note more subtle connections between types of innovation and networking, including that novel innovation outputs correlate with using network partners as a source of inspiration, whilst new competences associate with networking for knowledge capital. In the latter case, these activities also draw on new and intended ties relatively often, i.e. network partners which are actively sought out for the specific contributions they may make to the innovation process. Finally, innovation which is simultaneously new-to-the market and requires new competences uses strong ties relatively often. Implications for innovation policy and practice are discussed.

Operating-level boundary spanners are the primary agents of tacit knowledge learning across organizational borders, and we argue that trust is the primary determinant of knowledge sharing at that level. In contrast, the corporate-level boundary spanners shape the structures and systems of the collaboration and thus affect the extent of sharing that can take place between operating-level boundary spanners.

Secondly, relational social capital refers to the underlying normative conditions of trust, obligation, expectation and identity that guide actors' network relations. Thirdly, cognitive social capital refers to the meaningful contexts of communication among and between actors, and includes the shared language, codes and narratives used to create understanding.

In this study, we examine knowledge creation among university research scientists as a function of their professional (ego) networks-those others with whom they collaborate for the purpose of creating new knowledge. We propose that knowledge creation relies, in part, on two attributes of a researcher's professional network structure-average tie strength and ego network density-and we provide insights into how these attributes jointly affect knowledge creation. Our study of over 7,300 scientific publications by 177 research scientists working with more than 14,000 others over an 11-year period provides evidence that the relationship between a research scientist's professional network and knowledge creation depends on both ego network density and average tie strength. Our evidence suggests that both attributes affect knowledge creation. Moreover, average tie strength interacts with density to affect knowledge creation such that researchers who maintain mostly strong ties with research collaborators who themselves comprise a sparse network have the highest levels of new knowledge creation.",,,,"Semadeni, Matthew/G-2623-2010","Semadeni, Matthew/0000-0002-4240-7007",,,,,,,,,,,,1047-7039,,,,,MAY-JUN,2009,20,3,,,,,552,564,,10.1287/orsc.1080.0388,,,,,,,WOS:000266171000005,,,,,J,"Reiche, BS; Harzing, AW; Kraimer, ML",,,,"Reiche, B.

But, along with a growing number of critics, we suggest that this model has an excessively individualistic bias which views career success as largely a function of individual proactive traits and the person-cantered social networks built by individual action. As a result it has neglected the institutional resources needed to support such careers. In this paper we outline seven different sets of needs for successful boundaryless careers: career counselling, socioemotional support, job performance and entrepreneurial skills, skill transferability and certification, labour market assistance, financial and material resources, and collective voice. We then describe institutions that currently provide at least some of the resources to meet these needs and have the potential to provide more: employers, occupational communities and associations, labour unions, employment and recruiting agencies, temporary worker agencies, community organizations, the Internet, and government at all levels. Employers can play a key role in supporting boundaryless careers by serving as points of reference for independent and contract workers, in particular those who have been their full-time employees. Rather than boundaryless, we suggest that more appropriate metaphors for the new career might be boundary crossing and boundary converging.

This interest is driven by a growing corporate need for managers who are able to deal with global integration and co-ordination in large multinational corporations. An important aspect of the competency of a global manager is his or her social capital, i.e. the network relationships he or she possesses. However, while the concept of social capital has been widely used in a number of research fields recently, it has received relatively little attention thus far in the IHRM context. This paper contributes to this research gap, and seeks to answer the empirical research question of how multiple international relocations affect the social capital of a manager. Our qualitative interviews of 20 Finnish MNC managers with global careers identified that such careers represent a 'social capital paradox'. Global careers are characterized by a broad and diverse network of both internal and external ties. This breadth and diversity relate to (1) the managers' internal contact networks of weak ties (2) their internal support networks of strong ties and (3) their external networks of both strong and weak ties.

Findings - The data highlight that effective knowledge transfer between E&E units depends on a combination of key drivers, such as social network ties, absorptive capacity, learning adaptiveness, and communication channels. The findings suggest that the search for and transfer of knowledge depends foremost on the applicability of context-specific knowledge rather than its complexity.

Design/methodology/approach - The research design is based on a case study methodology, In particular, two actual technology districts are analyzed, namely Castel Romano and Toulouse, in order to show how they use organizational, and cognitive proximity to acquire external knowledge sources and re-shape their geographical boundaries. Findings - Based on the findings of the empirical study, two main propositions are formulated. The first proposition refers to the negative relationship between the geographical distance to the district actors and the use of organizational proximity as a means for reaching external knowledge sources. By contrast, the second proposition indicates the positive relationship between the geographical distance to the districts actors and the use of cognitive proximity as a means for reaching external knowledge sources. Research limitations/implications - As regards the firm strategic behaviors, it seems particularly crucial to exploit all the three dimensions of proximity, in order to guarantee openness and sustain innovativeness and competitiveness. Concerning policy implications, the local governments should address their actions to help and promote the openness of technology districts and the formation of technology clusters. With this aim, actions should be devoted also to sustaining single local firms that are part of a technology cluster but not of a technology district. These, in fact, by increasing their competitive position, may generate positive externalities in the local area, fostering the diffusion and sharing of knowledge in the area and, then, acting as knowledge gatekeepers for the whole area.

The relations that exist along members of the VCOP, the existing strength between their ties in their social network as well as the relations of support (to share knowledge with respect to its processes) that they have, are analyzed in this paper. Given the nature of our research, we define it as an exploratory one. In order to obtain the data of the members of the VCOP a questionnaire divided in three different sections was design and applied to 30 people in charge of the human resources area. Each of these people belongs to one of 30 different campus of the organization that are distributed in five different zones around the country. We use the social networks approach to analyze the data. Our findings show that the relationships, information and knowledge that participants of the VCOP have, depend on their geographic location. We can infer then that a clusterization in the distribution of the information and knowledge exists. In this sense, it is a fact that all members of the network do not participate in a similar way and they do not contribute uniformly with his knowledge. The data reveal that strategic positions exist along the network and that particular members that occupy those positions represent a detonating that promotes participation. A significant difference exists along the participation of network members although this network member's participation is foster in a similar way. Another important finding that our study shows is the existence of a correlation between the support that a member of the VCOP offers to other members of the community and the people who this member knows. The results indicate strong support for the fact that the greater number of members of the VCOP somebody knows in a face to face relationship, the more support this member will give to them.

In order to facilitate knowledge transfer, many PBOs have invested lots of financial and human resources to implement IT-based knowledge repository. However, some empirical studies found that employees would rather turn for knowledge to colleagues despite their ready access to IT-based knowledge repository. Therefore, it is apparent that social networks play a pivotal role in the knowledge transfer across projects. Some scholars attempt to explore the effect of network structure on knowledge transfer and performance, however, focused only on egocentric networks and the groups' internal social networks. It has been found that the project's external social network is also critical, in that the team members can not handle critical situations and accomplish the projects on time without the assistance and knowledge from external sources. To date, the influence of the structure of a project team's internal and external social networks on project performance, and the interrelation between both networks are barely known. In order to obtain such knowledge, this paper explores the interrelation between the structure of a project team's internal and external social networks, and their effect on the project team's performance.

Even if coded knowledge is easier to diffuse, the role of tacit knowledge is often essential for being able to use coded knowledge. Coded knowledge can even be unusable without the augmentation of tacit knowledge. The role of organizational culture is highly relevant for tacit knowledge sharing, which is social activity, face-to-face interaction and therefore can be influenced only through culture. This paper represents a theoretical research about how the types of organizational culture according to the Competitive Values Framework model are supportive for tacit knowledge sharing. The Competing Values Framework consists of four culture types: clan, adhocracy, market and hierarchy. Clan culture is found to support tacit knowledge sharing all, factors described refer to clan culture values and description. Adhocracy culture is the second culture type most supporting tacit knowledge sharing. Market and hierarchy hardly do so, and organizations willing to increase tacit knowledge sharing will have to increase the presence in their culture of clan and adhocracy types. These findings provide with insights, which put us closer to better understanding what factors to use to change organization in the direction of ""high"" tacit knowledge sharing.

Based on a sample of 39 engineering design teams in the space industry, this study examines the effects of leader position within different flows of communication on team creativity. The results indicate that the balance between holding a central or a peripheral position indeed determines the creativity of such teams. Specifically, very central and very peripheral positions of team leaders within the work-flow and awareness network hamper team creativity, whereas peripheral situated team leaders within the information network propel the creativity. In addition, team leaders stimulate creativity when they stay central in the external information network.

Six research questions are formulated with the aim to establish if and how functional membership and informal patterns of communication within an organization influence whether and why employees are willing to engage in product design modifications. We selected as a field site for our study an industrial company that had an internal research and product development operations and where the employees were located on the same site. A three-step approach within the manufacturing case company was designed: (1) In-depth interviews were carried out with managers and employees; (2) a survey questionnaire was sent out to all employees involved with a specific product that is subject to potential design modifications; and (3) a post hoc group feedback session was organized to further discuss our findings with the management. First, analysis of the nine in-depth interviews establishes a taxonomy of product design decisions involving four types of criteria; product-related, service-related, market-related, and feasibility-related criteria explain why employees would engage or not in product design modifications. Second, it is demonstrated that functional membership has a significant influence on the concern for these decision-making criteria as well as on the decision to proceed or not with product design modifications. In other words, functional membership influences whether and why employees are more or less willing to make product design modifications. In this manufacturing company, a global industrial player, the differences in concern appear especially for service- and market-related criteria and pertain particularly to the research and development (R&D) and service function. Overall, even though the perceived performance of the specific product under study did not differ significantly among the different departments, it is observed that R&D employees were significantly less in favor of proceeding with product design modifications than other employees were. Third, using UCINET VI software, we provide some explanations for this finding. It is shown that informal patterns of communication (i.e., employee degree centrality) operate a situational opportunity to make modifications to an existing product and a cognitive opportunity influencing the decision to modify product design following an inverted U-shaped function. Ultimately, we derive practical guidelines for an ideal product-team composition to reduce product design decision-making bias.",,,,"Lindgreen, Adam/D-4103-2019","Lindgreen, Adam/0000-0001-7881-7350",,,,,,,,,,,,0737-6782,1540-5885,,,,NOV,2008,25,6,,,,,528,545,,10.1111/j.1540-5885.2008.00320.x,,,,,,,WOS:000259087300002,,,,,J,"Montanari, F; Silvestri, G; Gallo, E",,,,"Montanari, Fabrizio; Silvestri, Giacomo; Gallo, Edoardo",,,Team Performance Between Change and Stability: The Case of the Italian 'Serie A',JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT,,,,,15th European Sport Management Congress,"SEP 05-09, 2006","Larnaca, CYPRUS",,,,,"This article studies the role of stability in team members' relations as a determinant of performance in the Italian 'Serie A' Soccer League.

This trade-off derives from the opposing implications of having redundant (i.e., directly or indirectly linked) contacts. Insofar as egos alters are nonredundant, ego can be expected to become more knowledgeable more quickly. And such nonredundancy can also be the basis for great power as ego monopolizes the flow of resources (including information) between egos alters. However, the very same mechanism that is behind egos power as a provider of resources - i.e., the possession of nonsubstituitable resources on the part of disconnected contacts also implies that that egos alters will themselves be monopolists, thus weakening ego as an acquirer of resources. Furthermore, while the surplus earned from providing resources on monopoly terms is potentially much greater than the surplus earned from acquiring resources on competitive terms, the former strategy carries the risk that socially distant actors will not value one anothers resources. Beyond elucidating the trade-off in the social structural foundation of knowledge and power, our framework also shows how the opposing implications of redundancy are the basis for a broad family of well known trade-offs (cosmopolitanism versus localism; exploration versus exploitation; insider versus stranger; robust versus simple identities) whose relationships with one another and with power and knowledge have not been appreciated. For all such trade-offs, the greater potential returns afforded by nonredundancy are balanced by the surer returns available from redundancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-6491,1464-3650,,,,OCT,2008,17,5,,,,,903,944,,10.1093/icc/dtn036,,,,,,,WOS:000259327600001,,,,,J,"Kane, GC; Alavi, M",,,,"Kane, Gerald C.; Alavi, Maryam",,,Casting the net: A multimodal network perspective on user-system interactions,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information systems (IS) researchers have typically examined the user-system relationship as an isolated dyad between a single, independent user and an individual, freestanding information system. We argue that this conceptualization does not adequately represent most organizations today, in which multiple users interact with multiple information systems within a group. Relying heavily on the theory and methods behind social network analysis, we introduce the concept of multimodal networks to assess both users and information systems as equivalent nodes in a single social network. This perspective allows us to examine the influence of information systems on organizational outcomes as a function of all of the user-system and interpersonal interactions in a group. We explore two different possible mechanisms for this influence: (1) direct user-system interactions by aggregating the strength of all the dyadic user-system interactions in a group, and (2) indirect user-system interactions by assessing the centrality of the information systems within the social network. We survey approximately 600 individuals in 40 healthcare groups to test whether either or both of these mechanisms are associated with two types of organizational performance outcomes-efficiency and quality of care. We find that the centrality of the information systems within the network is significantly and positively associated with both efficiency and quality outcomes, but that the average strength of the user-system interactions is not. Implications are that managers and researchers should examine the wider multimodal network of multiple users and multiple systems when assessing the role of IS in organizations in relation to organizational performance outcomes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1047-7047,,,,,SEP,2008,19,3,,,,,253,272,,10.1287/isre.1070.0158,,,,,,,WOS:000259723200002,,,,,J,"Hahn, J; Moon, JY; Zhang, C",,,,"Hahn, Jungpil; Moon, Jae Yun; Zhang, Chen",,,Emergence of new project teams from open source software developer networks: Impact of prior collaboration ties,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Recent years have witnessed a surge in self-organizing voluntary teams collaborating online to produce goods and services.

We try to close the bridge between areas of creation of tacit knowledge and transfer of knowledge highlighted by authors like Nonaka, Takeuchi, Konno, von Krogh and von Hippel with the area of communication patterns pioneered by Allen, Hatch, and Stryker, by considering face-to-face (FTF) communication as a first step for socialization, socialization as a means for knowledge creation. In this article, we compare two different office environments within the same site, same activity, same hierarchical level and same company: a traditional cell office area and a new multi-space office, used by people who used to work in cell offices. We observed FTF communication patterns during 120 h in two areas and measured over 2,000 communication events. We found that people communicate three times more often in a multi-space area than in a cell-space area. We also found that the mean duration of communication events decreased from 9 to 3 min when transferring collaborators from a cell-space to a multi-space. Finally time spent without communication increased from 5% to 29% when going from cell-offices to multi-space areas - leaving more time for people to work and think on their own.

We find, as anticipated, that amongst other factors specialist knowledge Providers are more likely to be engaged by firms with more open approaches to innovation, those with high levels of absorptive capacity, those with greater social capital and networking capabilities, as well as by those with deeper commitments to innovation. Overall, the use of specialist knowledge providers tends to complement firms' own internal innovation activities and to complement other external sources of knowledge. Moreover, the individual types of specialist knowledge providers tend to complement rather than substitute for one another. Beyond this we find significant differences in the types of specialist knowledge providers used by manufacturing and service firms. Although service firms are more likely than manufacturers to use specialist knowledge providers, they are more likely to engage consultants, whilst their links with research-based organisations, including the public science-base, are weaker.

Realising that this requires more than a bright inventor, the creator of Anoto brought in the right complementary assets at distinct phases of the commercialisation process. Our case illustrates how integrator and marketeer profiles were brought into a networked act of entrepreneurship for joint navigation across an ocean of relationships that gave birth to a global standard for digital writing. By combining theories on open innovation and networking, a theoretical framework is developed to analyse the different nature of the networks (or the value creation structure) in which complementary assets can be accessed, transferred and transformed into commercialised innovation. The analysis suggests that the value of complementary assets are embedded in and unlocked by three distinct types of networks: creativity networks, transformation networks and process networks. It also suggests that the ideal approach to accessing complementary assets shifts over the research and development management process, and happens through these three different types and levels of networks, requiring fundamentally different approaches to leadership and relationship management.

The influence of interpersonal trust in general and trust in management in particular on knowledge sharing is evident. However, it is not clear how the relationship between interpersonal trust and knowledge sharing works. This study provides a better understanding of that relationship by demonstrating that fear of losing one's unique value and knowledge documentation have a mediating effect on the relationship between trust in management and knowledge sharing. Specifically, trust in management increases knowledge sharing through reducing fear of losing one's unique value and improving willingness to document knowledge. These findings have important implications at both a managerial and theoretical level. For managers, this paper emphasizes the individual's central role in the knowledge sharing process in terms of knowledge documentation and fear of losing one's unique value. On the theoretical level, this study provides empirical evidence for two mechanisms that help explain the effect of trust in management on knowledge sharing.

It posits that individual differences in a personality variable called need for cognition capture differences in actors' cognitive motivation to realize the potential information benefits that exist in their social networks. Results show that network characteristics do affect information benefits, but these effects are stronger for managers motivated to take advantage of them.

One of the most important implications of these changes is the expansion of resources and products that are globally tradable, highlighting the importance of knowledge as the key economic resource of lasting competitive advantage. As a consequence of this shift in the economy, an increasing number of industries are moving from the closed innovation model to the open innovation model that created porous boundaries between the innovative company and its surrounding environment, changing the inter- and intra-organizational modes of coordination. In an environment where knowledge is the key economic resource and the open innovation model is applied in more and more industries, we are experiencing the increasing importance of the New Technology-Based Firm (NTBF). NTBFs face a number of difficulties mainly associated with a lack of resources and entrepreneurial skills and in order overcome the difficulties NTBFs strive towards flexibility while accelerating the development and commercialization processes by creating and/or entering business networks. By adopting a knowledge-based view for NTBFs and consequently placing knowledge in the centre of a systemic innovation model, knowledge networks constitute an asset for NTBFs. As this new form of cooperation takes multiple and often unpredictable forms it is thus essential to develop strategy formulation tools and processes that can help NTBFs to face their challenges. Until now little attention has been given to the development of strategy tools and processes tailored for the requirements of NTBFs. The present paper presents a concept to cope with NTBFs' by developing a generic process for strategy formulation. In this respect, an action research project was initiated. The proposed concept was initially designed, although not exclusively, for a Greek NTBF, Astrofos Ltd. The author, who is coordinator of the incubator where Astrofos is sited, is acting as-a strategy consultant for the firm and has taken part in all its major decisions since summer 2007. In order to build the strategy formulation process, this paper proposes a mapping technique that attempts to depict a NTBF's tangible and intangible transactions as well as the strength of ties between the focal NTBF and its partners and the complexity of the knowledge. In developing the mapping technique, we have used a combination of the concept of weak ties, derived from social network analysis, with the notion of complex knowledge, as this combination was initially proposed by Hansen (1999). Additionally, a set of questions is proposed that have to be answered in order to pass from knowledge identification to knowledge transfer, from a strategic point of view. In this regard, the presented methodology constitutes an effort, on the one hand, to study the emergent patterns in what is considered to be a chaotic or disordered system and, on the other, to stimulate the creation of new patterns in the system that would be consistent with the NTBF's strategy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-906638-16-0,,,,2008,,,,,,,279,287,,,,,,,,,WOS:000260973300032,,,,,B,"Bettoni, M; Schiller, G; Bernhard, W",,"Harorimana, D; Watkins, D",,"Bettoni, Marco; Schiller, Gabriele; Bernhard, Willi",,,Weak ties cooperation in the CoRe knowledge network,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,,,,,9th European Conference on Knowledge Management,"SEP 04-05, 2008","Southampton Sloent Univ, Southampton, ENGLAND",,Southampton Sloent Univ,,,"How to implement a collaborative knowledge strategy under conditions of weak ties? This paper will first explain how came that we faced this question in the research department of our university, then tell the story of how we are answering it by means of a new kind of knowledge network called ""CoRe"" and finally reflect on lessons we are learning about weak ties cooperation. The Swiss Distance University of Applied Sciences is organized in a radically decentralized way combined with traditional hierarchical structures and functional divisions. This has led to an insufficient level of interactions between geographically distributed university members (academic staff, students) so that weak ties have become the norm. In research one major consequence was that research activities were too much isolated in the departments, human resources were dispersed and research knowledge did not flow enough. Projects were small and less recognised, know how got easily lost and research tools' development was too slow. How to meet the challenge of improving research performances under conditions of weak ties like these? Our approach consisted in a collaborative knowledge strategy: to create and cultivate CoRe, an intra-organizational knowledge network of researchers (academic staff, students) organized as a community of practice connecting its members around the common task of stewarding research knowledge. This paper provides first an overview of how we are designing, implementing and cultivating the CoRe knowledge network and then reflections on the new subject of weak ties cooperation as realized in CoRe. In the first part, after introducing the background of the CoRe project as well as our approach to knowledge cooperation we will present the development process and focus on the evolution of the network requirements by comparing the initial and a revised version. In both cases these requirements were collaboratively developed by the network members in two large events: a) the network launch, a future search event (June 2006) and b) the 1(st) Annual CoRe Conference (June 2007). Based on an analysis of the evolution between these two versions, in the second part our paper will provide reflections and key lessons learned about how to design and implement a collaborative knowledge strategy which is able to foster knowledge cooperation under conditions of weak ties.

This paper finds that how matters become subjects of decision-making is at least as important part of municipal decision-making as how they are formally decided on. Both the progression of the process and the actual content of the decisions are largely resolved in preparation. The complex and rapidly changing operational environment is imposing special requirements, which are driving the municipal sector implementing new kinds of patterns. The paper deems it important that, alongside effective issues, municipal administration also strives to transcend conventional truths, search for new ideas from various non-interrelated sources, and create new possibilities from them. The paper engages with the knowledge management research tradition because the success of municipality is considered to be dependent on how efficiently the municipality can balance knowledge exploitation with knowledge exploration. Rather than focusing on administrative structures, the paper concentrates on the official and unofficial interaction processes within the preparation system, and between the preparation system and its environment, The paper finds that the interaction processes have hidden potential, which can be translated into a resource for balancing effectiveness and innovativeness. The resulting complexity-based framework, which can be seen as the main contribution of this paper, shows that paying attention to the interrelationships between the various actors and invisible dynamics of the preparation system provides a new perspective on the challenges facing municipal preparatory work. The complexity-based framework can be seen as an 'enabling structure' that facilitates the running of the preparation system and simultaneously ensures the co-evolution between the preparation system and the surrounding environment. This framework consists of five dimensions, which are: (i) interaction and feedback, (ii) trust, (iii) internal mechanisms, (iv) diversity, and (v) sense of timing and coevolution. The complexity-based framework helps to understand how municipal communities can benefit from their internal and external knowledge reserves and adapt to changes in the operating environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-906638-10-8,,,,2008,,,,,,,333,340,,,,,,,,,WOS:000259556500038,,,,,B,"Miyamoto, T; Hattori, Y; Yatera, A",,"Harorimana, D; Watkins, D",,"Miyamoto, Takuya; Hattori, Yasuhiro; Yatera, Akiyuki",,,The relation of rotation and knowledge transfer: A study of the R&D activities of a Japanese manufacturer,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,,,,,9th European Conference on Knowledge Management,"SEP 04-05, 2008","Southampton Sloent Univ, Southampton, ENGLAND",,Southampton Sloent Univ,,,"Japanese manufacturers have competitive strength particularly in the electronics and automobile industries.

In order to investigate the origin of this competitive strength pertaining to knowledge, which is evident in Japanese manufacturers, this paper sheds light on the rotation of personnel with regard to the research and development of forefront technology. We procured the rotation data of all the engineers (N = 1350) assigned to the central research institutes of a Japanese manufacturer. The central research institutes consisted of the material, mechatronics, e-component, and multimedia research institutes. In addition to utilizing this quantitative data, we interviewed the R&D director of the company who was familiar with all of its R&D activities. First, we analysed each research institute in 1998 based on the following criteria, and subsequently analysed each engineer's rotation term: (1) the number of engineers who had worked in the planning departments, (2) the number of engineers who had worked in the basic research institute, and (3) the number of engineers who had worked in the product development departments. Furthermore, based on the data obtained from the interviews, we were able to infer as follows. First, engineers from the planning departments play an important role in accessing the expertise of other organizations. Second, engineers from the basic research institute play a significant role in evaluating external expertise by utilizing the professional networks to which they belonged in the basic research institute. Finally, engineers from the product development departments play a crucial role in adapting the research in forefront technology to the market needs. The rotation of personnel facilitates knowledge transfer. This is because the rotated personnel bring with them new values, ideas, knowledge, and networks. In this paper, we discuss an adequate rotation policy by analysing two successful and unsuccessful research institutes. Our research subject was a large Japanese manufacturer. We revealed that the successful research institutes conducted adequate knowledge transfer through adequate rotation. Japanese manufacturers are well known as high-performance knowledge-sharing companies with strong networks.

In the market, users can access a repository of knowledge for a single price (repository pricing) or knowledge items in the repository can be sold individually (knowledge pricing). However, users have been found to prefer repository pricing but not the knowledge in the repository. This irrationality can cause market failure because users derive a suboptimal level of utility from the knowledge repository, and vendors have contradictory pricing and knowledge strategies. We empirically examine a joint explanation from two competing theoretical perspectives that accounts for this inconsistency nicely: The mental accounting perspective endorses repository pricing because it entices users with the benefits of the whole repository, whereas the transaction decoupling perspective finds expression in individually priced knowledge because it prevents the discrete benefit of knowledge from becoming obscure. By integrating the two theoretical perspectives and considering price, knowledge, and user characteristics simultaneously, the results offer important implications for the market transfer of knowledge.

The role of the three pillars is to discover new resource applications or uses in conditions of market failure that are characterized by 'incomplete' markets. A novel feature of this model is that an organization can diversify more broadly than predicted by Penrose (1959) and other modern resource-based approaches (Teece et al., 1997).

Analysis of variance shows few, if any, of the aspects of the standard conceptualizations of information exchange are associalted with increased levels of trust. It is information exchange norms that have the greatest (positive) association with the level of trust. These norms emerge as part of the long term co-production of the relationship itself. This has important managerial implications. We conclude there are few managerial actions involving managing communication that can ""manufacture"" trust and improve or develop relationships in the short term.

The preservation or dissolution of an embedded tie depends ultimately on two specific tie contingencies, the balance of power between the target firm and the embedded relation and interpretive processes at the interface between the two.

Finally, we encourage theory development in acquisition studies by positing the importance of interpretive processes and, more broadly, relational elements that span the boundaries of the parent-target dyad.",,,,"VOLBERDA, HENK/A-4042-2010; Volberda, Henk W./X-4450-2019; Van Den Bosch, Frans/A-4047-2010","VOLBERDA, HENK/0000-0003-0654-6824; Spedale, Simona/0000-0002-6103-0938",,,,,,,,,,,,0170-8406,1741-3044,,,,AUG,2007,28,8,,,,,1169,1196,,10.1177/0170840607075672,,,,,,,WOS:000248801000002,,,,,J,"Lee, DJ; Ahn, JH",,,,"Lee, Dong-Joo; Ahn, Jae-Hyeon",,,Reward systems for intra-organizational knowledge sharing,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Knowledge sharing is one of the most critical steps in knowledge management activities. To achieve effective knowledge sharing, it is important to encourage workers to share their knowledge for the best interests of the firm. However, successfully exerting this encouragement. is very challenging. In this paper, we develop a formal model and analyze reward systems for intra-organizational knowledge sharing. Specifically, two common forms of reward systems are considered; individual-based reward which is based on the individual contribution of valuable knowledge, and group-based reward which is based on the contribution of the whole group through knowledge sharing to the firm performance. Through the analysis, we derive a simple optimal individual-based reward system which depends on the amount and the productivity of shared knowledge. The system balances the benefit from knowledge sharing of each worker with the costs related with it. Next, it is found that group-based reward is not only less efficient than individual-based reward, but it also subject to a potential productivity problem, in which workers with more productive knowledge do not participate in knowledge sharing. Finally, it is shown that several organizational factors can complement reward systems in increasing the performance of KM and can mitigate the productivity problem. Insights from our analysis could help managers to understand important considerations in rewarding knowledge sharing, and could provide them with guides to implement reward systems.

Frequently, ideas and information are dispersed over globally distributed organizations or team members. As a result, the exchange of knowledge has become not only very important for innovation but also highly complex. To facilitate this knowledge exchange, electronically mediated interactions are growing rapidly, replacing traditional face-to-face communications. However, literature provides contradicting results regarding the effectiveness of computer-mediated communication (CMC) versus face-to-face communication. This study attempts to reconcile differences in the literature on the benefits of CMC technologies and co-location. Focusing on knowledge dissemination in technology development processes in high-technology firms, the study investigates the relative impact of CMC technologies and co-location of research and development (R&D) staff, as well as the mutual interaction between them. The present article hypothesizes that CMC technologies and co-location of R&D staff have a positive impact on knowledge dissemination. Further, it is hypothesized that it is more favorable to co-locate R&D staff than to invest in CMC technologies and that the effects of co-location and CMC interact negatively. These hypotheses are tested using empirical data collected from 277 high-technology firms in the United States, and the results are generalized by conducting the same test on data from 125 high-technology firms in the Netherlands. Tests are conducted in a real-world setting, differing from previous comparative studies that mainly used laboratory experiments. Empirical results support the main effects of CMC technologies and co-location of R&D staff on knowledge dissemination. Other empirical results contradict conventional wisdom. Investing in CMC technologies is found to be favorable over co-locating R&D staff for knowledge dissemination. Moreover, the two communication channels strengthen each other. The discussion section presents the contours of a firm-level theory on communication infrastructures and knowledge dissemination, focusing on the scope and the heterogeneity of knowledge dissemination, which may explain these initially surprising results. From the arguments it follows that the choice for investment in eo-location or CMC technologies depends on the scope of knowledge dissemination that has to be facilitated. Furthermore, the conclusion is made that effective knowledge dissemination requires a balanced investment in co-location and information technologies to be able to deal with the heterogeneous but interdependent types of knowledge dissemination.",,,,,"Berends, Hans/0000-0002-3334-2926",,,,,,,,,,,,0737-6782,,,,,JAN,2007,24,1,,,,,52,68,,10.1111/j.1540-5885.2006.00232.x,,,,,,,WOS:000242835400005,,,,,B,"He, JW; Wei, KK",,,PACIS,"He, Joy Wei; Wei, Kwok-Kee",,,Understanding Knowledge Management Systems Continuance: A Decomposed Model,"PACIFIC ASIA CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS 2007, SECTIONS 1-6",,,,,11th Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems,"JUL 03-06, 2007","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND",,,,,"Knowledge management (KM) research has yielded extensive theoretical explanations on the motivations of an individual to share knowledge using various types of face-to-face or virtual communication, each with different sets of influential factors.

The perspective of this idealised knower is a 'view from nowhere' (Nagel, 1986). In this paper we analyse and critique this view in the light of its applicability to the situation and needs of urban dwellers. The findings of our analysis allow us to call for a broadening of knowledge discourse beyond science and technology. We argue for the development of an epistemological model which takes into account and values transitory, informal, soft, implicit, contextual and tacit forms of knowledge, and its sources and utility outside the hard sciences. This model requires policy changes towards a democratisation of knowledge production and exchange and an acknowledgement of the significance of supporting education and urban community networking as mechanisms which enable knowledge sharing and participation in knowledge societies. Our proposed epistemological model supports a 'view from everywhere'. We hope it can uncover policy as well as technical opportunities and help inform ways and approaches to enable the social and community appropriation of information and communication technology for local knowledge production and exchange.",,,,"Foth, Marcus/I-9914-2012","Foth, Marcus/0000-0001-9892-0208",,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-905305-61-2,,,,2007,,,,,,,127,133,,,,,,,,,WOS:000253436500015,,,,,B,"Habib, J; Caraguel, V; Baets, W","Martins, B","Remenyi, D",,"Habib, Johanna; Caraguel, Valerie; Baets, Walter","Martins, B",,The use of new technology in higher education: From unlearning to wiki use appropriation in a French business school: A case study,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, VOL 1 AND 2",,,,,8th European Conference on Knowledge Management,"SEP 06-07, 2007","Consorci Escola Ind, Barcelona, SPAIN",ACL,Consorci Escola Ind,,,"It is widely agreed that the development of new technology in higher education is of particular importance. Yet, with a few exceptions, little is known about the conditions of appropriation by learners in this specific context. This paper attempts to address the relationship between the appropriation of new technology and the process of unlearning. We investigate why and how the actions modifying old knowledge can favour the use of collaborative and virtual technology. The framework of the paper is built on a review of Giddens's theory of structuration and learning theories, with particular focus on the concept of unlearning (Nystrom and Starbuck 1984). Unlearning is defined as the questioning and destruction process of knowledge, logic and patterns established, in order to propose new responses and behaviours. The empirical study proposes the analysis of the process appropriation of wiki technology by 300 students in a French business school [""Euromed Marseille""] in their workgroup sessions. We use a case study methodology (Eisenhardt 1989, Yin 1990) based on a qualitative investigation (Miles and Huberman 1984) and a combination of different collection. The results show that unlearning of traditional workgroup methods clearly facilitates appropriation of wiki technology. In other words, the unlearning-learning process appears to be essential to create virtual collective knowledge. Furthermore, this research provides some evidence about the factors that influence the speed of unlearning - deviant behaviours and tensions within groups, weak ties among group members, various expertise and visions, flexible collaboration... Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice, and also make recommendations to encourage unlearning opportunities in the process of new technology appropriation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-905305-52-0,,,,2007,,,,,,,398,+,,,,,,,,,WOS:000253974100053,,,,,J,"Eriksson, K; Fjeldstad, OD; Sasson, A",,,,"Eriksson, Kent; Fjeldstad, Oystein D.; Sasson, Amir",,,Knowledge of inter-customer relations as a source of value creation and commitment in financial service firm's intermediation,SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper develops a knowledge perspective on value creation in organisations that employ mediating technology to facilitate inter-customer relations. Mediators, individually and collectively, build networks of customers between whom linking can take place, and they provide services that facilitate inter-customer exchanges. Earlier research has shown the importance of size and standardisation in mediation. A different stream of research has shown that contextual knowledge is important for problem solving and innovation in organisations. Combining theories of mediating technology and situated problem solving, the paper posits that inter-customer relations constitute the fundamental context for value creation of firms using the mediating technology. LISREL is used to test relationship-level, cross-sectional hypotheses that link knowledge of inter-customer relationships, added value, and customer commitment to bank services for small firms. This work extends Thompson's work on mediating technology with implications for organisation action by demonstrating that mediators' knowledge of inter- customer relationships is an important resource in intermediation. Three contributions are made to strategic management and organisation theory. First, the paper provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between knowledge and committed customers. Second, fundamental resources are developed for firms using mediating technology.

As expected, intraregional and intrafirm knowledge flows are found to be stronger than those across regional or firm boundaries. I explore whether these patterns can be explained by direct and indirect network ties among inventors, as inferred from past collaborations among them. The existence of a tie is found to be associated with a greater probability of knowledge flow, with the probability decreasing as the path length (geodesic) increases. Furthermore, the effect of regional or firm boundaries on knowledge flow decreases once interpersonal ties have been accounted for. In fact, being in the same region or firm is found to have little additional effect on the probability of knowledge flow among inventors who already have close network ties.

The effects of social networks and institutional sex composition on the job search outcomes of elite coeducational and women's college graduates,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"In this paper, I develop a perspective on women's career attainment focused on how employers' salary offers may be constructed based on their assumptions regarding women's access to comparative salary information. Therefore, although the use of social networks in job search may enhance women's actual knowledge of prevailing wages, I hypothesize that institutional characteristics that employers could assume to constrain women's networks and concomitant access to salary information will directly affect salary offers, as well as moderating the influence of network ties on pay. To test this perspective. job search outcomes of women attending elite coeducational and women's colleges were examined. Regarding the number of offers obtained, women who consulted with proportionally more male peer and employed adult male advice ties received significantly more job offers than women using fewer male advice contacts. With regard to salary offers, this study reveals an institutional sex composition effect: women exiting single-sex institutions (i.e., women's colleges) received significantly lower salary offers than women from coeducational schools, even after accounting for human capital, job characteristics, and institutional reputation. The effects of social networks on pay were moderated by institutional sex composition such that women exiting women's colleges received lower returns in the form of salary to their cross-gender advice ties than did women from a matched coeducational institution.

Contemporary KM initiatives increasingly include expertise-sharing networks that help answer questions about who knows what. These systems allow organizations to locate and leverage the specialized engineering and technical expertise that is held in the minds of dispersed individuals. However, stories of such expertise-sharing networks that languish from under-use and abandonment abound and the issue of continuance has received very little attention in prior research. In this paper, we explore this understudied issue. We develop a model of expertise-sharing network system continuance through a four-year observational study of 418 users of two such systems and then empirically test it using multiperiod data collected from 122 users of four such systems. The concept of irretrievable investments was used to guide theoretical development in the initial observational phase of the study. The study makes several unique theoretical contributions. First, it develops a model that illustrates how irretrievable postadoption investments (sunk costs) by individual users of expertise-network systems increase continuance. We empirically show that the model explains approximately half of the total variance in continuance intention. This model advances continuance beyond the traditional expectation-satisfaction model of initial adoption to more advanced postadoption stages of use and theoretically incorporates the network-specificity aspect of postadoption investments in explaining continuance. Specifically, we show that individual users': 1) reputation among peer users of a system increases continuance; 2) system-mediated relationships with other users of the system increase continuance; and 3) investments in personalization of a system initially diminish continuance. Another notable contribution is the development and validation of several new measures for expertise-sharing network constructs.",,,,"Wang, Charles/B-5565-2011","Wang, Charles/0000-0001-9331-8437",,,,,,,,,,,,0018-9391,,,,,FEB,2005,52,1,,,,,85,101,,10.1109/TEM.2004.839956,,,,,,,WOS:000226570500007,,,,,S,"Willem, A; Buelens, M",,"Sanchez, R; Heene, A",,"Willem, Annick; Buelens, Marc",,,KNOWLEDGE FLOWS BETWEEN UNITS THROUGH DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTER-UNIT LINKAGES,MANAGING KNOWLEDGE ASSETS AND ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING,Research in Competence-Based Management,,,,,,,,,,,"In the strategic literature, the value of knowledge has long been discussed. It goes without saying that knowledge can be the source of competitive advantages because of its unique and sticky characteristics (Conner & Prahalad, 1996; Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997). However, that advantage can be limited to a certain business unit, department or project-team (Argote & Ingram, 2000; Gupta & Govindarajan, 2000; Szulanski, 1996). To build organization-wide capabilities and competences, knowledge needs to be transferred within the organisation but this is a highly complex process (Argote & Ingram, 2000; Szulanski, 2000). We draw on a review of the existing literature to analyse how knowledge can cross unit boundaries within larger organisations. This is to develop an analytical model of the effects of different inter-unit linkages on the sharing of knowledge. We describe the linkages between units and members of the units in terms of coordination mechanisms. Our study highlights the characteristics of each of these linkages in terms of intensity and complexity of knowledge and intensity in knowledge sharing. In addition, the role of trust is discussed. We observe that different types are associated with distinctive constraints for particular kinds of knowledge needs; for example, informal networks are able to deal with the need for sharing complex knowledge but do not allow enough flexibility in the knowledge-sharing possibilities. A case study in a British multinational company in the production and retail sector seeks fir empirical evidence of our assumed relationships between linkages and knowledge-sharing possibilities. The case reveals the role of informal networks, the impact of the complexity of knowledge and shared mindset. Strategic directions turned out to have a major effect on the possibilities to share knowledge.

I present and discuss findings with respect to the characteristics and perceived effectiveness of these memory systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-2380,,,,,SEP,2000,37,6,,,,,811,832,,10.1111/1467-6486.00205,,,,,,,WOS:000166066400003,,,,,J,"Rowley, T; Behrens, D; Krackhardt, D",,,,"Rowley, T; Behrens, D; Krackhardt, D",,,Redundant governance structures: An analysis of structural and relational embeddedness in the steel and semiconductor industries,STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"Network researchers have argued that both relational embeddedness-characteristics of relationships-and structural embeddedness-characteristics of the relational structure-influence Jinn behavior and performance. Using strategic alliance networks in the semiconductor and steel industries, we build on past embeddedness research by examining the interaction of these factors. We argue that the roles relational and structural embeddedness play in firm performance can only be understood with reference to the other. Moreover, we argue that the influence of these factors on firm performance is contingent on industry context. More specifically, our empirical analysis suggests that strong ties in a highly interconnected strategic alliance network negatively impact firm performance. This network configuration is especially suboptimal for firms in the semiconductor industry. Furthermore, strong and weak ties are positively related to firm performance in the steel and semiconductor industries, respectively.

I use a network study of 120 new-product development projects undertaken by 41 divisions in a large electronics company to examine the task of developing new products in the least amount of time. Findings show that weak interunit ties help a project team search for useful knowledge in other subunits but impede the transfer of complex knowledge, which tends to require a strong tie between the two parties to a transfer. Having weak interunit ties speeds up projects when knowledge is not complex but slows them down when the knowledge to be transferred is highly complex. I discuss the implications of these findings for research on social networks and product innovation.*",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0001-8392,,,,,MAR,1999,44,1,,,,,82,111,,10.2307/2667032,,,,,,,WOS:000079452100004,,,,,J,"Constant, D; Sproull, L; Kiesler, S",,,,"Constant, D; Sproull, L; Kiesler, S",,,The kindness of strangers: The usefulness of electronic weak ties for technical advice,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"People use weak ties-relationships with acquaintances or strangers-to seek help unavailable from friends or colleagues. Yet in the absence of personal relationships or the expectation of direct reciprocity, help from weak ties might not be forthcoming or could be of low quality. We examined the practice of distant employees (strangers) exchanging technical advice through a large organizational computer network. A survey of advice seekers and those who replied was conducted to test hypotheses about the viability and usefulness of such electronic weak tie exchanges. Theories of organizational motivation suggest that positive regard for the larger organization can substitute for direct incentives or personal relationships in motivating people to help others. Theories of weak ties suggest that the usefulness of this help may depend on the number of ties, the diversity of ties, or the resources of help providers. We hypothesized that, in an organizational context, the firm-specific resources and organizational motivation of people who provide advice will predict the usefulness of advice. We investigated these theories in a study of employees of a global computer manufacturer. We collected survey and observational data on the relationships between information seekers and information providers; the number, diversity, resources, and motivations of information providers, and subjective ratings of the usefulness of the advice (from both parties in the exchange) and whether or not the advice solved information seekers' problems. We found that information providers gave useful advice and solved the problems of information seekers, despite their lack of a personal connection with the seekers. The data support the main hypotheses and provide some support for resource and diversity explanations of weak tie influence. We discuss how this organization's culture sustained useful information exchange through weak ties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1047-7039,,,,,MAR-APR,1996,7,2,,,,,119,135,,10.1287/orsc.7.2.119,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VU27600002,,,,,J,"PICKERING, JM; KING, JL",,,,"PICKERING, JM; KING, JL",,,"HARDWIRING WEAK TIES - INTERORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION, OCCUPATIONAL COMMUNITIES, AND ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE",ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Interorganizational computer-mediated communication (ICMC) is expanding rapidly through the Internet and other elements of infrastructure. ICMC can be expected to evolve into the mainstream of existing communications infrastructure, but this evolution is not occurring uniformly across organizations. ICMC infrastructure appears to be most strongly supported, at least in this early stage, among organizations dependent on the maintenance of external weak social ties among employees who are members of professional, dispersed occupational communities. This can be seen in the experience of research-oriented organizations. Two strong forces-the professionalism of key occupational communities seeking autonomy, and a persistent desire by organizations to reduce fixed costs and organizational size-are posited as encouraging growth of ICMC infrastructure. Such growth might provide an important ''bootstrapping mechanism'' of long-predicted shifts from hierarchical to market forms of organization, at least in professionalized sectors of the economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1047-7039,,,,,JUL-AUG,1995,6,4,,,,,479,486,,10.1287/orsc.6.4.479,,,,,,,WOS:A1995RN13500008,,,,,
